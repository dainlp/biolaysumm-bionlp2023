But when deaths occur varies greatly by sex , age , cause of death , and possibly region . Seasonal differences in death rates can change over time due to changes in factors that cause disease or affect treatment . Analyzing the seasonality of deaths can help scientists determine whether interventions to minimize deaths during a certain time of year are needed , or whether existing ones are effective . Scrutinizing seasonal patterns in death over time can also help scientists determine whether large-scale weather or climate changes are affecting the seasonality of death . Now , Parks et al . show that there are age and sex differences in which times of year most deaths occur . Parks et al . analyzed data on US deaths between 1980 and 2016 . While overall deaths in a year were highest in winter and lowest in summer , a greater number of young men died during summer \u2013 mainly due to injuries \u2013 than during winter . Seasonal differences in deaths among young children have largely disappeared and seasonal differences in the deaths of older children and young adults have become smaller . Deaths among women and men aged 45 or older peaked between December and February \u2013 largely caused by respiratory and heart diseases , or injuries . Deaths in this older age group were lowest during the summer months . Death patterns in older people changed little over time . No regional differences were found in seasonal death patterns , despite large climate variation across the USA . The analysis by Parks et al . suggests public health and medical interventions have been successful in reducing seasonal deaths among many groups . But more needs to be done to address seasonal differences in deaths among older adults . For example , by boosting flu vaccination rates , providing warnings about severe weather and better insulation for homes . Using technology like hands-free communication devices or home visits to help keep vulnerable elderly people connected during the winter months may also help .", "source": "In temperate climates , winter deaths exceed summer ones . However , there is limited information on the timing and the relative magnitudes of maximum and minimum mortality , by local climate , age group , sex and medical cause of death . We used geo-coded mortality data and wavelets to analyse the seasonality of mortality by age group and sex from 1980 to 2016 in the USA and its subnational climatic regions . Death rates in men and women \u2265 45 years peaked in December to February and were lowest in June to August , driven by cardiorespiratory diseases and injuries . In these ages , percent difference in death rates between peak and minimum months did not vary across climate regions , nor changed from 1980 to 2016 . Under five years , seasonality of all-cause mortality largely disappeared after the 1990s . In adolescents and young adults , especially in males , death rates peaked in June/July and were lowest in December/January , driven by injury deaths . \n It is well-established that death rates vary throughout the year , and in temperate climates there tend to be more deaths in winter than in summer ( Campbell , 2017; Fowler et al . , 2015; Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) . It has therefore been hypothesized that a warmer world may lower winter mortality in temperate climates ( Langford and Bentham , 1995; Martens , 1998 ) . In a large country like the USA , which possesses distinct climate regions , the seasonality of mortality may vary geographically , due to geographical variations in mortality , localized weather patterns , and regional differences in adaptation measures such as heating , air conditioning and healthcare ( Davis et al . , 2004; Braga et al . , 2001; Kalkstein , 2013; Medina-Ram\u00f3n and Schwartz , 2007 ) . The presence and extent of seasonal variation in mortality may also itself change over time ( Bobb et al . , 2014; Carson et al . , 2006; Seretakis et al . , 1997; Sheridan et al . , 2009 ) . A thorough understanding of the long-term dynamics of seasonality of mortality , and its geographical and demographic patterns , is needed to identify at-risk groups , plan responses at the present time as well as under changing climate conditions . Although mortality seasonality is well-established , there is limited information on how seasonality , including the timing of minimum and maximum mortality , varies by local climate and how these features have changed over time , especially in relation to age group , sex and medical cause of death ( Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . In this paper , we comprehensively characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality in the USA by sex and age group , through the application of wavelet analytical techniques , to over three decades of national mortality data . Wavelets have been used to study the dynamics of weather phenomena ( Moy et al . , 2002 ) and infectious diseases ( Grenfell et al . , 2001 ) . We also used centre of gravity analysis and circular statistics methods to understand the timing of maximum and minimum mortality . In addition , we identify how the percentage difference between death rates in maximum and minimum mortality months has changed over time . \n The strengths of our study are its innovative methods of characterizing seasonality of mortality dynamically over space and time , by age group and cause of death; using wavelet and centre of gravity analyses; using ERA-Interim data output to compare the association between seasonality of death rates and regional temperature . A limitation of our study is that we did not investigate seasonality of mortality by socioeconomic characteristics which may help with understanding its determinants and planning responses . \n We used wavelet and centre of gravity analyses , which allowed systematically identifying and characterizing seasonality of total and cause-specific mortality in the USA , and examining how seasonality has changed over time . We identified distinct seasonal patterns in relation to age and sex , including higher all-cause summer mortality in young men ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , we also showed that all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality is largely similar in terms of both timing and magnitude across diverse climatic regions with substantially different summer and winter temperatures . Insights of this kind would not have been possible analysing data averaged over time or nationally , or fixed to pre-specified frequencies . Prior studies have noted seasonality of mortality for all-cause mortality and for specific causes of death in the USA ( Feinstein , 2002; Kalkstein , 2013; Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) . Few of these studies have done consistent national and subnational analyses , and none has done so over time , for a comprehensive set of age groups and causes of death , and in relation to regional temperature differences . Our results on strong seasonality of cardiorespiratory diseases deaths and weak seasonality of cancer deaths , restricted to older ages , are broadly consistent with these studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) , which had limited analysis on how seasonality changes over time and geography ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) . Similarly , our results on seasonality of injury deaths are supported by a few prior studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) , but our subnational analysis over three decades revealed variations in when injury deaths peaked and in how seasonal differences in these deaths have changed over time in relation to age group which had not been reported before . A study of 36 cities in the USA , aggregated across age groups and over time , also found that excess mortality was not associated with seasonal temperature range ( Kinney et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , a European study found that the difference between winter and summer mortality was lower in colder Nordic countries than in warmer southern European nations ( Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) ( the study\u2019s measure of temperature was mean annual temperature which differed from the temperature difference between maximum and minimum mortality used in our analysis although the two measures are correlated ) . The absence of variation in the magnitude of mortality seasonality indicates that different regions in the USA are similarly adapted to temperature seasonality , whereas Nordic countries may have better environmental ( e . g . housing insulation and heating ) and health system measures to counter the effects of cold winters than those in southern Europe . If the observed absence of association between the magnitude of mortality seasonality and seasonal temperature difference across the climate regions also persists over time , the changes in temperature as a result of global climate change are unlikely to affect the winter-summer mortality difference . The cause-specific analysis showed that the substantial decline in seasonal mortality differences in adolescents and young adults was related to the diminishing seasonality of ( unintentional ) injuries , especially from road traffic crashes , which are more likely to occur in the summer months ( Liu et al . , 2005 ) and are more common in men . The weakening of seasonality in boys under five years of age was related to two phenomena: first , the seasonality of death from cardiorespiratory diseases declined , and second , the proportion of deaths from perinatal conditions , which exhibit limited seasonality ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2 and Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 3 ) , increased ( MacDorman and Gregory , 2015 ) . In contrast to young and middle ages , mortality in older ages , where death rates are highest , maintained persistent seasonality over a period of three decades ( we note that although the percent seasonal difference in mortality has remained largely unchanged in these ages , the absolute difference in death rates between the peak and minimum months has declined because total mortality has a declining long-term trend ) . This finding demonstrates the need for environmental and health service interventions targeted towards this group irrespective of geography and local climate . Examples of such interventions include enhancing the availability of both environmental and medical protective factors , such as better insulation of homes , winter heating provision and flu vaccinations , for the vulnerable older population ( Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Social interventions , including regular visits to the isolated elderly during peak mortality periods to ensure that they are optimally prepared for adverse conditions , and responsive and high-quality emergency care , are also important to protect this vulnerable group ( Healy , 2003; Lerchl , 1998; Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Emergent new technologies , such as always-connected hands-free communications devices with the outside world , in-house cameras , and personal sensors also provide an opportunity to enhance care for the older , more vulnerable groups in the population , especially in winter when the elderly have fewer social interactions ( Morris , 2013 ) . Such interventions are important today , and will remain so as the population ages and climate change increases the within- and between-season weather variability . \n We used data on all 85 , 854 , 176 deaths in the USA from 1980 to 2016 from the National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) . Age , sex , state of residence , month of death , and underlying cause of death were available for each record . The underlying cause of death was coded according to the international classification of diseases ( ICD ) system ( 9th revision of ICD from 1980 to 1998 and 10th revision of ICD thereafter ) . Yearly population counts were available from NCHS for 1990 to 2016 and from the US Census Bureau prior to 1990 ( Ingram et al . , 2003 ) . We calculated monthly population counts through linear interpolation , assigning each yearly count to July . We also subdivided the national data geographically into nine climate regions used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Figure 18 and Table 2 ) ( Karl and Koss , 1984 ) . On average , the Southeast and South are the hottest climate regions with average annual temperatures of 18 . 4\u00b0C and 18\u00b0C respectively; the South also possesses the highest average maximum monthly temperature ( 27 . 9\u00b0C in July ) . The lowest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the Southeast ( an average range of 17 . 5\u00b0C ) . The three coldest climate regions are West North Central , East North Central and the Northwest ( 7 . 6\u00b0C , 8 . 0\u00b0C , 8 . 2\u00b0C respectively ) . Mirroring the characteristics of the hottest climate regions , the largest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the coldest region , West North Central ( an average range of 30 . 5\u00b0C ) , which also has the lowest average minimum monthly temperature ( \u22126 . 5\u00b0C in January ) . The other climate regions , Northeast , Southwest , and Central , possess similar average temperatures ( 10\u00b0C to 14\u00b0C ) and variation within the year of ( 23\u00b0C to 26\u00b0C ) , with the Northeast being the most populous region in the United States ( with 19 . 8% total population in 2016 ) . Data were divided by sex and age in the following 10 age groups: 0\u20134 , 5\u201314 , 15-24 , 25\u201334 , 35\u201344 , 45\u201354 , 55\u201364 , 65\u201374 , 75\u201384 , 85+\u00a0years . We calculated monthly death rates for each age and sex group , both nationally and for sub-national climate regions . Death rate calculations accounted for varying length of months , by multiplying each month\u2019s death count by a factor that would make it equivalent to a 31 day month . For analysis of seasonality by cause of death , we mapped each ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to four main disease categories ( Table 1 ) and to a number of subcategories which are presented in the Supplementary Note . Cardiorespiratory diseases and cancers accounted for 56 . 4% and 21 . 2% of all deaths in the USA , respectively , in 1980 , and 40 . 3% and 22 . 4% , respectively , in 2016 . Deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases have been associated with cold and warm temperatures ( Basu , 2009; Basu and Samet , 2002; Bennett et al . , 2014; Braga et al . , 2002; Gasparrini et al . , 2015 ) . Injuries , which accounted for 8% of all deaths in the USA in 1980 and 7 . 3% in 2016 , may have seasonality that is distinct from so-called natural causes . We did not further divide other causes because the number of deaths could become too small to allow stable estimates when divided by age group , sex and climate region . We obtained data on temperature from ERA-Interim , which combines predictions from a physical model with ground-based and satellite measurements ( Dee et al . , 2011 ) . We used gridded four-times-daily estimates at a resolution of 80 km to generate monthly population-weighted temperature by climate region throughout the analysis period . We used wavelet analysis to investigate seasonality for each age-sex group . Wavelet analysis uncovers the presence , and frequency , of repeated maxima and minima in each age-sex-specific death rate time series ( Hubbard , 1998; Torrence and Compo , 1998 ) . In brief , a Morlet wavelet , described in detail elsewhere ( Cazelles et al . , 2008 ) , is equivalent to using a moving window on the death rate time series and analysing periodicity in each window using a short-form Fourier transform , hence generating a dynamic spectral analysis , which allows measuring dynamic seasonal patterns , in which the periodicity of death rates may disappear , emerge , or change over time . In addition to coefficients that measure the frequency of periodicity , wavelet analysis estimates the probability of whether the data are different from the null situation of random fluctuations that can be represented with white ( an independent random process ) or red ( autoregressive of order one process ) noise . For each age-sex group , we calculated the p-values of the presence of 12 month seasonality for the comparison of wavelet power spectra of the entire study period ( 1980\u20132016 ) with 100 simulations against a white noise spectrum , which represents random fluctuations . We used the R package WaveletComp ( version 1 . 0 ) for the wavelet analysis . Before analysis , we de-trended death rates using a polynomial regression , and rescaled each death rate time series so as to range between 1 and \u22121 . To identify the months of maximum and minimum death rates , we calculated the centre of gravity and the negative centre of gravity of monthly death rates . Centre of gravity was calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , with each month weighted by its death rate; negative centre of gravity was also calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , but with each month was weighted by the difference between its death rate and the year\u2019s maximum death rate . In taking the weighted average , we allowed December ( month 12 ) to neighbour January ( month 1 ) , representing each month by an angle subtended from 12 equally-spaced points around a unit circle . Using a technique called circular statistics , a mean ( \u03b8- ) of the angles ( \u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83\u2026 , \u03b8n , ) representing the deaths ( with n the total number of deaths in an age-sex group for a particular cause of death ) is found using the relation below:\u03b8-=arg\u2211j=1nexp\u2061 ( i\u03b8j ) , where arg denotes the complex number argument and \u03b8j denotes the month of death in angular form for a particular death j . The outcome of this calculation is then converted back into a month value ( Fisher , 1995 ) . Along with each circular mean , a 95% confidence interval ( CI ) was calculated by using 1000 bootstrap samples . The R package CircStats ( version 0 . 2 . 4 ) was used for this analysis . For each age-sex group and cause of death , and for each year , we calculated the percent difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months . We fitted a linear regression to the time series of seasonal differences from 1980 to 2016 , and used the fitted trend line to estimate how much the percentage difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months had changed from 1980 to 2016 . We weighted seasonal difference by the inverse of the square of its standard error , which was calculated using a Poisson model to take population size of each age-sex group through time into account . This method gives us a p-value for the change in seasonal difference per year , which we used to calculate the seasonal difference at the start ( 1980 ) and end ( 2016 ) of the period of study . Our method of analysing seasonal differences avoids assuming that any specific month or group of months represent highest and lowest number of deaths for a particular cause of death , which is the approach taken by the traditional measure of Excess Winter Deaths . It also allows the maximum and minimum mortality months to vary by age group , sex and cause of death ."}

Or that gritty sensation when dust blows into the eye and irritates the surface . These sensations are warnings from sensory nerves in the cornea , the transparent tissue that covers the iris and pupil . Corneal nerves help regulate blinking , and control production of the tear fluid that protects and lubricates the eye . But if the cornea suffers damage or infection , it can become inflamed . Long-lasting inflammation can damage the corneal nerves , leading to pain and vision loss . If scientists can identify how this happens , they may ultimately be able to prevent it . To this end , Royer et al . have used mice to study three causes of hard-to-treat corneal inflammation . The first is infection with herpes simplex virus ( HSV-1 ) , which also causes cold sores . The second is eye allergy , where the immune system overreacts to substances like pollen or pet dander . And the third is graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , an immune disorder that can affect people who receive a bone marrow transplant . Royer et al . showed that HSV-1 infection and GVHD \u2013 but not allergies \u2013 made the mouse cornea less sensitive to touch . Consistent with this , microscopy revealed damage to corneal nerves in the mice with HSV-1 infection and those with GVHD . Further experiments showed that immune cells called CD4 T cells and a protein called complement C3 were contributing to this nerve damage . Treating the mice with an experimental drug derived from cobra venom protected the cornea from the harmful effects of inflammation . It did so by blocking activation of complement C3 at the eye surface . Identifying factors such as complement C3 that are responsible for corneal nerve damage is an important first step in helping patients with inflammatory eye diseases . Many drugs that target the complement pathway are currently under development . Some of these drugs could potentially be adapted for delivery as eye drops . But first , experiments must test whether complement also contributes to corneal nerve damage in humans . If it does , work can then begin on testing these drugs for safety and efficacy in patients .", "source": "Whether complement dysregulation directly contributes to the pathogenesis of peripheral nervous system diseases , including sensory neuropathies , is unclear . We addressed this important question in a mouse model of ocular HSV-1 infection , where sensory nerve damage is a common clinical problem . Through genetic and pharmacologic targeting , we uncovered a central role for C3 in sensory nerve damage at the morphological and functional levels . Interestingly , CD4 T cells were central in facilitating this complement-mediated damage . This same C3/CD4 T cell axis triggered corneal sensory nerve damage in a mouse model of ocular graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . However , this was not the case in a T-dependent allergic eye disease ( AED ) model , suggesting that this inflammatory neuroimmune pathology is specific to certain disease etiologies . Collectively , these findings uncover a central role for complement in CD4 T cell-dependent corneal nerve damage in multiple disease settings and indicate the possibility for complement-targeted therapeutics to mitigate sensory neuropathies . \n Dysregulated complement activation is increasingly recognized as a significant pathological event in a variety of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases of the central nervous system ( Tenner et al . , 2018 ) . These include conditions from Alzheimer\u2019s disease and age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis ( Hong et al . , 2016; Knickelbein et al . , 2015; Lee et al . , 2018; Loveless et al . , 2018 ) . Complement may orchestrate peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) disorders as well . For instance , nociceptive hypersensitivities , sensory neuropathies , and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have been linked to aberrant complement activation ( Rosoklija et al . , 2000; Ramaglia et al . , 2008; Jang et al . , 2010; Fritzinger and Benjamin , 2016; Xu et al . , 2018; Susuki et al . , 2007 ) . However , the mechanistic role of complement is not well understood in neuroinflammatory pathologies impacting the PNS . Moreover , the pathophysiological trigger of sensory fiber retraction which contributes to sensation loss and in some instances chronic pain is unclear ( Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . Available treatments for peripheral neuropathies primarily focus on clinical symptoms without addressing the underlying pathomechanisms ( Colloca et al . , 2017 ) . Accordingly , elucidation of relevant pathomechanisms underlying sensory neuropathies may translate into efficacious mechanism-based therapeutics . The complement cascade is comprised of dozens of soluble and membrane-bound factors essential for host defense and efficient clearance of cellular debris . However , proper regulation of complement activation is necessary to balance immune responses and prevent collateral tissue damage ( Ricklin et al . , 2016 ) . The complement cascade pivots upon activation of complement component 3 ( C3 ) for its downstream proinflammatory effects . The pathogenic contributions of complement in systemic disease have been reviewed extensively in recent years ( Dob\u00f3 et al . , 2018; Hajishengallis et al . , 2017; McGeer et al . , 2017; Ricklin et al . , 2016 ) . Nonetheless , emerging concepts centering on complement effector synthesis within inflamed tissue microenvironments have ushered in a \u2018renaissance\u2019 of novel complement-targeted drug development strategies ( Ricklin et al . , 2018; Tomlinson and Thurman , 2018 ) . Therefore , elucidating whether the complement cascade is a viable therapeutic target in inflammation-associated peripheral nerve impairment remains medically important . The eye has been labeled a \u2018complement dysregulation hotspot\u2019 due to complement\u2019s contributions to many ophthalmic diseases , but complement activation is restricted in the healthy cornea ( Clark and Bishop , 2018 ) . As observed in AMD , subtle inflammatory reactions in the eye can mediate significant visual morbidity . Accordingly , ocular inflammation is tightly regulated by various anatomic , physiologic , and immunologic mechanisms in order to maintain visual acuity ( Amouzegar et al . , 2016; Streilein , 2003; Taylor et al . , 2018 ) . These homeostatic mechanisms , collectively dubbed \u2018ocular immune privilege , \u2019 help preserve the ocular surface and enable the cornea to properly focus incoming light onto the retina . Furthermore , corneal nerves are increasingly recognized as central regulators of immune privilege at the ocular surface ( Guzm\u00e1n et al . , 2018; Neelam et al . , 2018; Paunicka et al . , 2015 ) . Consequently , inflammatory events that damage corneal nerves can have insidious consequences in terms of ocular surface health and transparency ( M\u00fcller et al . , 2003; Shaheen et al . , 2014; Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . One such pathway that can rapidly initiate inflammation following activation is the complement cascade . Corneal nerves originate predominantly from the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal ganglion ( TG ) , and these peripheral nerves provide the cornea with the highest density of sensory fibers in the human body . While the cornea and peripheral nerves constitutively synthesize complement proteins ( Bora et al . , 2008; de Jonge et al . , 2004 ) , the role of the complement cascade in corneal nerve damage has not been explored . Nonetheless , the complement pathway is poised for vigorous activation in the cornea in response to noxious or inflammatory stimuli ( Bora et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , C3 activation has been reported in the cornea soon after infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ) , which is a common cause of corneal sensory nerve damage in patients ( Royer et al . , 2017; Sacchetti and Lambiase , 2014 ) . Given the cornea\u2019s high density of sensory nerves , it is particularly amenable for investigating the mechanistic role of complement in peripheral nerve damage . To this end , we evaluated corneal nerve integrity and mechano-sensory function using a murine model of ocular HSV-1 infection to test the hypothesis that local complement activation and T cell engagement coordinate corneal nerve damage . The pathobiology underlying non-penetrating corneal nerve damage is not well understood , although inflammation is generally recognized as an important feature ( Neelam et al . , 2018; Shaheen et al . , 2014; Cruzat et al . , 2015; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2016; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017b; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017a ) . While HSV-1 is a clinically prominent cause of corneal nerve damage and sensation loss , a variety of pathogenic microbes impair the corneal nerve architecture upon ocular infection ( Cruzat et al . , 2015 ) . This observation adds to evidence that the neurotropism of HSV-1 is not directly responsible for nerve damage ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2016 ) . In addition to sensation loss evoked by HSV-1 , corneal nerve alterations in other contexts such as dry eye disease are associated with a broad array of neuropathic clinical symptoms including dryness , itch , and pain ( Andersen et al . , 2017 ) . To further qualify the possible role of complement in corneal nerve damage independent of infection , we evaluated corneal mechanosensory function in two noninfectious T cell-dependent ocular surface inflammatory diseases . For this purpose , we utilized established murine models of allergic eye disease ( AED ) and ocular graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) ( Herretes et al . , 2015; Lee et al . , 2015 ) . Our rationale for this is that complement has been implicated in the etiology of systemic GVHD and allergic inflammation ( Gour et al . , 2018; Kwan et al . , 2012; Ma et al . , 2014; Nguyen et al . , 2018; Zhang and K\u00f6hl , 2010 ) . However , a neuroinflammatory role of complement has not been described for either disease within the eye . The translational relevance of this study is underscored by in vivo confocal microscopy data from multiple clinical studies showing architectural changes in the corneal nerves of patients with herpetic keratitis , chronic ocular allergy , and ocular GVHD ( Hamrah et al . , 2010; M\u00fcller et al . , 2015; Moein et al . , 2018; Hu et al . , 2008; Le et al . , 2011; Leonardi et al . , 2012; Tepelus et al . , 2017; He et al . , 2017a ) . Elucidating the pathomechanisms underlying corneal nerve damage may enable development of more effective therapeutics to mitigate progression of such ocular surface inflammatory diseases . Each of the animal models utilized herein mimic clinically important , chronic ocular surface morbidities . Herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ) is a common cause of neurotropic keratitis and remains a leading cause of infectious corneal blindness ( Sacchetti and Lambiase , 2014; Farooq and Shukla , 2012 ) . The incidence of ocular allergy exceeds twenty percent of the population with varying degrees of neurogenic ocular surface discomfort that can severely diminish quality of life ( Craig et al . , 2017; Patel et al . , 2017; Saban et al . , 2013 ) . Finally , GVHD is the greatest cause of non-relapse morbidity following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) used to treat life-threatening malignancies and immunologic diseases ( MacDonald et al . , 2017 ) . A majority of patients with chronic presentations of GVHD suffer from ocular surface involvement ( Shikari et al . , 2013 ) . \n Adaptive immunity has been shown to prevent recovery of corneal sensory function following ocular HSV-1 infection ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) , but the initial pathophysiological triggers of denervation and sensation loss are not definitively characterized . Ocular HSV-1 infection provokes corneal denervation and sensation loss between days 5 to 8 post-infection ( p . i . ) in immunologically naive C57BL/6 mice ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015 ) . This tempo appears to be synchronized with the host transition from innate to adaptive immunity following infection . Indeed , corneal nerve fiber retraction was evident upon T cell infiltration in the cornea ( Figure 1A ) . Accordingly , we hypothesized that local complement activation and T cell engagement coordinate corneal nerve damage during HSV-1 infection . To address our hypothesis , corneal sensation and pathogen burden were evaluated in C57BL/6 wildtype ( WT ) and complement C3-deficient ( C3-/- ) mice following ocular HSV-1 infection . Progressive loss of corneal mechano-sensitivity was evident in WT mice by days 5 to 8 p . i . , but corneal sensation was conserved in the C3-/- cohort ( Figure 1B ) . The same trend revealing preservation of corneal sensation in C3-/- animals was also observed with an increased HSV-1 challenge inoculum ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Viral titers were measured at time points before and after the onset of corneal sensation loss to determine whether the divergence in sensation stemmed from a differential susceptibility to infection . On day 3 p . i . , the HSV-1 burden was similar in the tear film , corneas , and TG of WT and C3-/- animals ( Figure 1C\u2013D ) . By day 7 p . i . , HSV-1 titers were elevated in the tear film and TG of C3-/- mice relative to WT ( Figure 1C , E ) . Corneal buttons from WT mice exhibited extensive denervation with CD3+ T cell infiltration at day 8 p . i . ( Figure 1F ) . However , T cell infiltration was observed without widespread denervation in C3-/- corneas ( Figure 1F ) . The number of cornea-infiltrating CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were similar among WT and C3-/- mice ( Figure 1G ) . Together , these data indicate that corneal sensation loss in herpetic keratitis involves a C3-dependent inflammatory process independent of viral burden . Although T cells successfully extravasate into the corneas of WT and C3-/- mice ( Figure 1F , G ) , C3-deficiency can have broad impacts on T cell priming , clonal expansion , and recruitment ( Clarke and Tenner , 2014; West et al . , 2018 ) . To investigate this possibility , corneas from HSV-1-infected WT and C3-/- mice were evaluated for chemokines associated with T cell recruitment , and the eye-draining mandibular lymph nodes ( MLN ) were harvested to evaluate T cell responses . Chemokines associated with T cell recruitment were elevated in corneas from both WT and C3-/- mice at day 5 p . i . \u2014a time consistent with onset of sensation loss ( Figure 2A ) . Moreover , CD4+ and CD8+ T cell expansion was comparable within the eye-draining mandibular lymph nodes ( MLN ) from WT and C3-/- mice ( Figure 2B ) . Similarly , T cells harvested from WT and C3-/- mice at day 8 p . i . responded equally to in vitro stimulation in terms of IFN\u03b3 production ( Figure 2C ) . Collectively , these data show that C3-/- T cells exhibit normal expansion and recruitment to the cornea during ocular HSV-1 infection . In support of our hypothesis that C3 and T cells jointly coordinate corneal sensation loss , frank corneal sensation loss was not observed following ocular HSV-1 infection in C3-sufficient , alpha-beta T cell receptor-deficient mice ( TCR\u03b1-/- ) which congenitally lack classical CD4+ and CD8+ T cells ( Figure 2D ) . To investigate potential functional defects of C3-/- T cells in an in vivo context , CD3+ T cells were harvested from HSV-infected WT or C3-/- mice at day 8 p . i . and adoptively transferred into TCR\u03b1-/- mice . Six days following cell transfer , TCR\u03b1-/- recipients were infected with HSV-1 and corneal sensation monitored longitudinally . Adoptive transfer of CD3+ T cells from either WT or C3-/- donors evoked progressive corneal sensation loss in TCR\u03b1-/- recipients by day 8 p . i . ( Figure 2D ) . These findings further corroborate that C3-/- T cells remain functional in vivo . Analysis of corneal sensation was not feasible beyond 8 days p . i . , as the TCR\u03b1-/- mice succumbed to herpetic encephalitis . However , engraftment of donor cells was confirmed by analysis of T cells in the eye-draining MLN of recipient mice by flow cytometry at day 8 p . i . The baseline lymphocyte counts in MLN from TCR\u03b1-/- controls likely reflect expansion of non-classical T cell populations ( Viney et al . , 1994 ) . An increase in total cell number was observed for CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells upon adoptive transfer of purified CD3+ T cells into TCR\u03b1-/- recipient mice ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Consistent with this observation , our data show that transfer of CD3+ T cells from HSV-infected mice have no appreciable impact on HSV-1 titers in the TG of TCR\u03b1-/- recipients by day 8 p . i . ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Notably , bulk transfer of HSV-specific CD8+ T cells has been shown to reduce viral burden in the peripheral nervous system of C57BL/6 mice during acute HSV-1 infection ( Conrady et al . , 2009; Royer et al . , 2016 ) . Our collective findings reveal that C3 and T cells are individually necessary and interdependent in the pathogenesis of HSV-1-associated corneal sensation loss . Whether by direct or indirect mechanisms , these data support a paradigm in which C3 activation and T cell engagement coordinate corneal nerve damage in herpetic keratitis . Our data show that T cells contribute to corneal sensation loss during acute HSV-1 infection , yet whether this pathology is dependent upon CD4+ or CD8+ T cells remained unclear . To better discern the contributions of each subset , CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were harvested from infected WT mice , transferred into separate groups of TCR\u03b1-/- mice , and recipient mice subsequently infected with HSV-1 . Corneal sensation loss during acute HSV-1 infection was only observed upon reconstitution with CD4+ T cells ( Figure 3A ) . Donor cell engraftment was confirmed by flow cytometry , although a statistically significant increase in cell number within the eye-draining MLN was only observed upon transfer of CD4+ T cells ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The requirement for antigen specificity was subsequently evaluated during acute HSV-1 infection by monitoring corneal sensation in WT and OT-II transgenic mice that generate ovalbumin ( OVA ) -specific CD4 T cells . Transgenic OT-II mice did not exhibit corneal sensation loss following infection despite evidence of bystander CD4+ T cell activation and recruitment into the cornea ( Figure 3B\u2013D ) . Adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells from HSV-infected WT and OT-II mice into TCR\u03b1-/- recipients corroborated these findings ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Abrasion of the corneal epithelium , which is required to mediate infection in this model , induces local chemokine expression capable of recruiting T cells to the cornea even in the absence of viral infection ( Liu et al . , 2012 ) . Nonetheless , active corneal HSV-1 infection was necessary to provoke corneal sensation loss , as TCR\u03b1-/- mice reconstituted with CD4+ T cells harvested from HSV-infected WT mice did not elicit auto/allo-antigen-associated sensation loss within two weeks of corneal scratch injury ( i . e . mock infection ) ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Collectively , our data show that complement C3 and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells are simultaneously necessary to drive corneal sensation loss during HSV-1 infection . These results strongly portend that a coordinated inflammatory axis exists involving C3 and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells , and that it is responsible for sensory neuropathy in herpetic keratitis . Complement-mediated tissue pathology can arise from complement activators synthesized by the liver ( systemic complement ) or in tissue microenvironments ( local complement ) . While local complement activation and regulation have been reported in the cornea in health and disease ( Bora et al . , 1993; Clark and Bishop , 2018; Mondino and Brady , 1981; Verhagen et al . , 1992 ) , the expression profile and cellular sources of various complement components have not been investigated in the context of ocular HSV-1 infection . To this end , a modest array of complement component transcripts was evaluated by semiquantitative real-time PCR on corneal buttons from healthy and HSV-infected mice at day 2 and 7 p . i . Upregulation of complement effectors and anaphylatoxin receptors were noted including C3 , C5 , C3ar1 , and C5ar1 ( Figure 4A , B ) . Constitutive expression of complement receptor 2 ( CD21 ) has been reported in the corneal epithelium ( Levine et al . , 1990 ) , but variances in its expression during HSV-1 infection were not statistically significant across the time points evaluated ( Figure 4B ) . Likewise , no differences in the local expression of various complement regulators were observed in HSV-infected corneas aside from the C1-inhibitor SerpinG1 ( Table 1 , Figure 4C ) . Collectively , this expression profile favors local complement activation , as effectors are upregulated without proportional enhancement of pathway regulatory components . As C3 is the central component of the complement activation pathway , the cellular sources of complement C3 were evaluated in corneas infected with HSV-1 . Monocytes and tissue macrophages are known sources of C3 ( Einstein et al . , 1977; Lubbers et al . , 2017; Morgan and Gasque , 1997; Verschoor et al . , 2001 ) , thus CSF1R+ cells from the peripheral blood of transgenic CSF1R-GFP mice ( MAFIA ) were utilized as the relative standard for C3 transcript expression . Expression of C3 was noted in CD45+ leukocytes isolated from infected corneas , yet detection of C3 expression was lost when CSF1R+ cells were removed from the total CD45+ pool . In addition , isolated EpCAM+ corneal epithelial cells expressed C3 at levels comparable to blood monocytes . However , the C3 expression level was greater in whole-cornea preparations than among individual cell fractions ( Figure 4D ) . Taken together , our data show that both tissue-resident non-hematopoietic cells and resident/infiltrating CSF1R+ leukocytes contribute to local C3 expression in the cornea during acute HSV-1 infection . Ocular HSV-1 infection amplifies local complement gene expression , yet whether local control of complement activation can be harnessed to prevent corneal nerve damage has not been explored . From a clinical perspective , modulating complement activation at the ocular surface may be a viable therapeutic option . As a proof of concept , daily ocular cobra venom factor ( CVF ) treatment was explored as a putative method to deplete C3 and preserve corneal sensation during acute HSV-1 infection . Vehicle ( PBS ) -treated mice exhibited corneal sensation loss following HSV-1 infection , but CVF treatment preserved corneal sensation ( Figure 5A ) . Protein levels of C3 remained near baseline in the cornea following CVF treatment during HSV-1 infection , yet vehicle-treated animals exhibited a 300\u2013600% increase in C3 protein levels in the cornea at days 3 and 7 p . i . ( Figure 5B ) . Ocular CVF treatment did not significantly impact systemic serum C3 concentrations throughout the study ( Figure 5C ) . Ocular CVF treatment limited corneal edema during HSV-1 infection relative to the vehicle control ( Figure 5D ) . Consistent with this observation , CVF-treated animals had less leukocytic infiltrate ( CD45+ ) into the cornea at day 3 p . i . and , specifically , fewer infiltrating CSF1R+ cells ( Figure 5E , F ) . By day 7 p . i . , no difference in total CD45+ or CSF1R+ cells were observed in the cornea , yet there was a reduction in the total number of infiltrating CD4+ T cells ( Figure 5G ) . Despite the difference in CSF1R+ cell infiltration into the corneas at day 3 p . i . , HSV-1 titers were similar in the corneas and TG comparing vehicle- and CVF-treated animals ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . By day 7 p . i . CVF-treated animals had less virus in the corneas and TG than vehicle controls ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B ) , suggesting that CVF may have unexpected antiviral effects . However , CVF treatment did not have any discernable impact on T cell expansion in the eye-draining MLN or the total number of circulating CXCR3+ CD4+ T cells in HSV-1 infected animals ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Collectively , these findings imply that complement-targeted therapeutics could be tailored for ophthalmic use to limit tissue inflammation and preserve corneal sensation . While complement C3 and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells appear to coordinate corneal sensation loss in herpetic keratitis , it remained to be determined whether this phenomenon was specific to HSV-1 infection . To this end , corneal sensation was measured independent of infection in two T cell-dependent ocular surface inflammatory diseases . Murine models of allergic eye disease ( AED ) and ocular graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) were employed to further delineate the hypothesized role of T cells in coordinating corneal nerve damage ( Herretes et al . , 2015; Lee et al . , 2015 ) . First , AED was induced using an established systemic ovalbumin ( OVA ) -sensitization and ocular challenge model ( Figure 6A ) mimicking aspects of chronic keratoconjunctivitis ( Ahadome et al . , 2016; Lee et al . , 2015 ) . Clinical signs of ocular allergy developed as anticipated in OVA-challenged mice ( Figure 6B ) , yet corneal sensation loss was not observed ( Figure 6C ) . Consistent with development of AED , corneas from OVA-challenged mice exhibited CD3+ T cell infiltration by challenge day 7 ( Figure 6D ) . However , frank corneal nerve loss was not observed in AED ( Figure 6D ) . Morphometric analysis of confocal image stacks confirmed the preservation of corneal nerve density during AED ( Figure 6E ) , although CD3+ T cell numbers were elevated in sensitized animals relative to healthy controls ( Figure 6F ) . Flow cytometry was used to verify that the cornea-infiltrating T cells were predominately CD4+ in the AED model ( Figure 6G ) . Although clinical data show that corneal nerve remodeling can occur in patients with chronic ocular allergy ( Hu et al . , 2008; Le et al . , 2011 ) , allergy symptoms were not accompanied by frank loss of corneal mechano-sensation in the AED animal model . Corneal sensation was also evaluated in a T cell-dependent allogeneic model of chronic GVHD with systemic and ocular manifestations following hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) transplantation ( Perez et al . , 2016 ) . This minor histocompatibility antigen mismatch model was established by transferring HSC-rich bone marrow ( BM ) and purified T cells from C57BL/6 ( H2b ) donors into lethally irradiated sex-matched C3 . SW-H2b recipients . Recipient controls that receive BM without T cells recover and do not develop GVHD ( Figure 7A ) . Onset of GVHD was established by transfer of BM with CD4+ T cells only , CD8+ T cells only , or both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells . Progressive corneal sensation loss was observed following transfer of CD4+ T cells with and without addition of CD8+ T cells . Addition of CD8+ T cells alone evoked a transient corneal sensation deficit that recovered by day 26 post-transplant . However , corneal sensation loss was not observed in the BM only control group ( Figure 7B ) . External signs of ocular disease ( see Table 2 ) were also apparent in groups receiving CD4+ T cells by the study endpoint ( Figure 7C ) . The presence of tissue-infiltrating CD3+ T cells in corneas from animals with GVHD was verified by confocal microscopy at the study endpoint . Consistent with sensation loss , corneal nerve integrity was markedly reduced in groups receiving CD4+ T cells ( Figure 7D ) . Morphometric analysis of confocal image stacks confirmed the CD4-dependent decrease in corneal nerve density ( Figure 7E ) and concomitant increase in total CD3+ cells ( Figure 7F ) . Taken together , our data show for the first time that corneal sensation loss occurs early in ocular GVHD and that this pathology is instigated in part by allogeneic CD4+ T cells . The pharmacologic impact of local CVF treatment on ocular GVHD progression was consequently explored in order to identify whether the CD4+ T cell-associated corneal sensation loss observed in both herpetic keratitis and ocular GVHD shared a common C3-codependent pathomechanism . For these experiments , GVHD was established in C3 . SW-H2b recipients by transfer of C57BL/6-derived BM and CD3+ T cells . Recipients from the BM only control and GVHD cohorts received ophthalmic treatment with either PBS or CVF ( Figure 8A ) . Systemic disease progressed equally in both GVHD cohorts regardless of treatment ( Figure 8B ) . Although CVF administration was limited to the eye , systemic serum C3 concentrations were lower in the GVHD cohort treated with CVF compared to the PBS-treated GVHD groups at the study endpoint . Nonetheless , the inverted CD4:CD8 T cell ratio ( Herretes et al . , 2015 ) in the spleens and eye-draining mandibular lymph nodes of both groups of GVHD mice confirmed the presence of systemic disease ( Figure 8D ) . Despite development of systemic disease , local CVF treatment preserved corneal nerve integrity and mechano-sensory function in ocular GVHD ( Figure 8E , F ) . Morphometric analysis of confocal image stacks from the study endpoint corroborated the preservation of corneal nerve density in CVF-treated mice from the GVHD cohort ( Figure 8G ) , although CVF did not reduce the number of total CD3+ cells during GVHD relative to PBS ( Figure 8H ) . In addition , CVF treatment also limited GVHD-associated periocular disease in female but not in male mice ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . In summary , these preclinical models establish that CD4+ T cells and complement C3 coordinate corneal sensory nerve damage in both herpetic keratitis and ocular GHVD . Moreover , our data provide a proof of principle that complement-targeted therapeutics may limit the severity of immune-mediated sensory nerve damage at the ocular surface . \n Mechanistic advances in our understanding of the complement cascade\u2019s physiologic regulation and pathologic contributions in disease have predictably spawned substantial investments in complement-targeted drug development over the past decade ( Harris et al . , 2018; Ricklin et al . , 2018; Tomlinson and Thurman , 2018 ) . The ocular surface is a unique milieu in which pharmacologic modulation of the complement pathway may limit the severity of inflammatory disease and improve clinical outcomes . This study provides proof of concept that such interventions may have important clinical impacts on ocular surface disease , and specifically neuropathic sensory disorders affecting the cornea . Complement-targeted drug development for ophthalmic use has almost exclusively focused on AMD with some interest in neuromyelitis optica ( NMO ) , Stargardt disease , and autoimmune uveitis ( Harris et al . , 2018; Pittock et al . , 2013 ) . By July 2019 , there were no complement-specific therapeutics indicated for ocular surface use registered on www . clinicaltrials . gov ( search strings: \u2018complement\u2019 / \u2018C3\u2019 / \u2018C5\u2019 / \u2018eculizumab\u2019 AND \u2018cornea\u2019 , \u2018conjunctiva\u2019 , \u2018dry eye\u2019 , \u2018keratitis\u2019 , OR \u2018ocular surface\u2019 ) . Nonetheless , the complement pathway is implicated in the pathophysiology of several ocular surface diseases ( Bora et al . , 2008 ) . The current investigation provides an important advancement in this arena by demonstrating that dysregulated complement activation can specifically contribute to sensory nerve damage in the cornea . While corneal nerves are increasingly implicated in maintenance of corneal immune privilege ( Paunicka et al . , 2015; Neelam et al . , 2018; Guzm\u00e1n et al . , 2018 ) , this study is the first to identify that C3 is involved in the pathobiology of corneal sensory nerve damage . However , the individual fates of damaged corneal nerves were not explored herein . Lessons from peripheral nerve injury in other settings indicate that some damaged nerves undergo apoptosis , yet effectively promoting functional regeneration of surviving neurons remains a major clinical hurtle ( Doron-Mandel et al . , 2015; Menorca et al . , 2013; Scheib and H\u00f6ke , 2013; Shacham-Silverberg et al . , 2018 ) . Likewise , promoting functional regeneration of damaged corneal nerves is important for restoration of immune privilege and ocular surface health . Our approach evaluated sensory nerve damage in murine models of T cell-dependent ocular surface disease including HSV-1 keratitis , OVA-induced AED , and ocular GHVD . The lack of a sensory phenotype in the AED model was unanticipated in light of evidence that patients with severe allergy exhibit changes in corneal nerve morphology ( Hu et al . , 2008; Le et al . , 2011; Leonardi et al . , 2012 ) . This contrasting model underscores the context-dependency of sensation loss during corneal inflammation . While we focused on C3 in HSV-1 keratitis and ocular GVHD due to the direct link to overt corneal sensation loss , complement may still have an important role in mediating neurogenic hypersensitivities in AED . In addition to loss of mechano-sensory function , corneal nerve pathologies can involve a broad array of neuropathic clinical symptoms including dryness , itch , and pain ( Andersen et al . , 2017 ) . Inflammatory mediators facilitate neuropathic hypersensitivities , but the therapeutic potential of complement inhibition is often overlooked ( Baral et al . , 2019; Fritzinger and Benjamin , 2016 ) . Moreover , the cornea produces many neurotrophic factors that influence sensory innervation in health and disease ( Sacchetti and Lambiase , 2017; Yu et al . , 2015 ) . Given the involvement of C3 activation in sensory nerve damage , future investigation into crosstalk between complement and other neurotropic factors in the cornea is warranted . Furthermore , AED is driven primarily by a combined Th2/Th17 CD4 T cell response that differs from the Th1 bias observed in HSV-1 keratitis and ocular GVHD ( Herretes et al . , 2015; Saban et al . , 2013; Tang and Hendricks , 1996 ) . This suggests that Th1 cytokines such as IFN\u03b3 , IL-2 , and lymphotoxin-alpha may be important in coordinating corneal sensation loss . Nonetheless , the unique inflammatory milieus and differential polarizations of cornea-infiltrating T cells across these disease models may also influence the downstream effects of complement activation in the tissue microenvironment ( Tomlinson and Thurman , 2018 ) . Future studies are needed to broaden the scope of these observations to other peripheral nerve diseases . For example , complement-mediated microvascular damage in diabetes correlates with neuropathy ( Rasmussen et al . , 2018; Rosoklija et al . , 2000 ) . While diabetic peripheral neuropathy can lead to neurotropic corneal ulcerations ( Gao et al . , 2016b ) , the role of complement in diabetic corneal disease is currently unknown . Complement enhances clearance of infected cells and nascent virions during HSV-1 infection ( Kostavasili et al . , 1997; Lubinski et al . , 2002; McNearney et al . , 1987 ) . Importantly , HSV-1 can also evade C3 activation through endogenous expression of glycoprotein C ( gC ) . By limiting C3b deposition on infected cells and nascent virions , gC can inhibit subsequent C5 binding and membrane attack complex ( MAC ) formation ( Kostavasili et al . , 1997; Lubinski et al . , 2002; McNearney et al . , 1987; Tegla et al . , 2011 ) . This could explain why herpetic keratitis is less severe in rabbits infected with a gC-deficient strain of HSV-1 during acute infection ( Drolet et al . , 2004 ) . However , this gC-mediated viral evasion strategy may also be cell type-dependent . Cell culture modeling indicates that neuronal cells maintain host-encoded complement regulator expression more efficiently and are more resistant to MAC deposition than epithelial cells upon HSV-1 infection ( Rautemaa et al . , 2002 ) . Accordingly , complement-mediated sensory nerve damage in HSV-1 keratitis may reflect a maladaptive outcome of host-defense . This is consistent with our data showing that immunologically naive C3-/- mice maintain corneal sensation and innervation , yet they exhibit concomitant enhancement of viral shedding in the tear film and increased viral burden in the TG by day 7 p . i . The absence of a concordant difference in HSV-1 titers in corneas from WT and C3-/- mice is likely explained by the potent antiviral effects of type-1 interferon ( Conrady et al . , 2011; Royer and Carr , 2016 ) . This suggests that the maintenance of corneal innervation in C3-/- mice enables enhanced shedding of nascent virions produced within the TG . Moreover , there is no difference in the amount of latent HSV-1 in the TG of naive WT and C3-/- mice 30 days after ocular HSV-1 challenge ( Royer et al . , 2019 ) . Taken together , this evidence indicates that although C3 is involved in progression of keratitis and sensory nerve fiber retraction during acute infection , it likely does not contribute to complete elimination of infected nerves . The studies reported herein involve immunologically naive mice , but the impacts of preexisting humoral immune responses on complement pathway activation and regulation in the cornea during HSV-1 infection remain incompletely understood . This point is of considerable importance clinically , as herpes-associated neurotropic keratitis typically develops as a result of recurrent corneal infections in patients ( Hamrah et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , we have recently reported that C3 is essential for optimal antibody-dependent viral clearance following ocular HSV-1 challenge in mice ( Royer et al . , 2019; Royer et al . , 2017 ) . While vaccinated animals did not exhibit corneal sensation loss following ocular HSV-1 infection in those studies , deposition of the terminal C3 cleavage product C3d was present in the corneal epithelium ( Royer et al . , 2017 ) . Host gene expression data herein corroborates that HSV-1 infection creates an imbalance in the local complement effector to regulator expression ratios that contribute to aberrant complement pathway activation in the cornea . This imbalance in \u2018complement proteostasis\u2019 may favor deposition of complement fragments and sublytic MAC on corneal sensory nerve fibers ( Tegla et al . , 2011; Triantafilou et al . , 2013 ) . Notwithstanding , the nerve-intrinsic molecular mechanisms responsible for trigeminal sensory fiber retraction , neuronal death , or axonal regeneration in the cornea are largely unknown ( Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . Future work is needed to identify the respective complement activation pathways involved in pathologic and protective immune responses to HSV-1 in the cornea . Identification of the complement pathway\u2019s role in initiating corneal sensation loss following HSV-1 infection is an important advancement in the mechanistic understanding of this disease process , as it introduces an array of potential drug targets for local therapy . Previous observations note that complement activation in antigen-induced keratitis may be mediated by cellular immune mechanisms ( Verhagen et al . , 1992 ) . The identification of CSF1R+ macrophages/monocytes as a local source of C3 during infection ( Figure 4D ) is also critical , as these cells are recruited to the cornea in the early stages of HSV-1 infection and are associated with corneal nerve damage in HSV-1 keratitis ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017b; Conrady et al . , 2013 ) . Moreover , CD4 T cells coordinate this pathology . Our data corroborate findings from the Hendricks\u2019 lab showing that CD4 T cells are associated with corneal sensation loss in HSV-1 keratitis ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) , yet our adoptive transfer experiments establish that this process is not dependent upon endogenous C3 production by cornea-infiltrating donor T cells ( Figure 2D ) . Notably , the tempo of HSV-associated sensation loss was consistent among models once initiated ( Figure 1B , Figure 2D , Figure 3A ) . However , the initial onset was delayed by one day in the adoptive transfer model . This likely reflects the relative lymphopenic status of T cell-reconstituted TCR\u03b1-/- mice compared to WT mice ( compare Figure 2B and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Corneal sensation loss in HSV-1 infection and ocular GVHD shared a common mechanism dependent upon CD4+ T cells and complement C3 . The role of intracellular C3 in regulating human Th1 responses has received much attention in recent years ( Elvington et al . , 2017; Hansen et al . , 2019; Liszewski et al . , 2013 ) . Such studies involve CD3 and CD46 stimulation to activate human CD4 T cells in vitro . However , mice do not express CD46 . Instead , anaphylatoxin receptor signaling has been shown to modulate Th1 cytokine production in murine T cells ( Strainic et al . , 2008 ) . Our ex vivo re-stimulation data clearly show that there is no defect in IFN\u03b3 production by CD4 T cells from C3-/- mice following HSV-1 infection . Others have shown similar data based on T cell proliferation in response to re-stimulation with HSV-1 antigen ( Da Costa et al . , 1999 ) . In contrast , a reduction in IFN\u03b3 production by CD4 T cells from C3-/- mice was reported following in vitro expansion under Th1 polarizing conditions ( Liszewski et al . , 2013 ) . Nonetheless , it is possible that anaphylatoxin receptor signaling from locally produced C3a ( and potentially C5a generated downstream ) modulates T cell effector function upon extravasation into the inflamed cornea . The precise relationships between T cells and C3 in our mouse models of corneal neuropathic disease remain to be identified . Our working hypothesis involves an indirect mechanism whereby sublytic MAC deposition from local complement activation damages sensory nerves , which are then cleared by T cell-activated phagocytes or other cytolytic cells . These could include tissue-resident and infiltrating leukocytes ( macrophages , monocytes , dendritic cells , and NK cells ) as well as nerve-associated corneal epithelial cells ( Buela and Hendricks , 2015; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017b; Gao et al . , 2016a; Koyama and Hill , 2016; Liu et al . , 2017; Royer et al . , 2018; Seyed-Razavi et al . , 2014; Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . Emerging evidence indicates that the plasma membranes of corneal nerves and epithelial cells fuse thereby enabling cytosolic exchange ( Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . In light of this , it is plausible that complement-mediated damage to corneal epithelial cells has a direct impact on sensory nerves . Although corneal nerve damage is an established pathology in animal models of HSV-1 infection ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015; He et al . , 2017b; Yun et al . , 2014 ) , this is the first report documenting loss of corneal mechano-sensory function in ocular GVHD . Notably , patients rarely exhibit neurological manifestations of GVHD affecting other tissues/organs ( Grauer et al . , 2010 ) . Corneal sensation loss may provide a clinical benchmark for initiation of targeted therapies to curb progression of ocular GVHD in patients . Data from our animal model of GVHD suggest that corneal sensation loss is an early warning sign of progressive ocular and systemic GVHD . Corneal sensation measurements are warranted in patients following HSCT to substantiate this finding among those who develop chronic GVHD . Published imaging studies confirm that corneal nerve remodeling occurs in patients with ocular GVHD ( He et al . , 2017a; Tepelus et al . , 2017 ) ; therefore , clinical studies to delineate the kinetics of disease onset are needed . Complement C3 is a known driver of systemic GVHD ( Kwan et al . , 2012; Ma et al . , 2014; Seignez et al . , 2017 ) , and our data show that aberrant complement pathway activation also contributes to the pathogenesis of ocular GVHD including corneal sensation loss . Furthermore , localized CVF treatment preserved corneal sensation in both sexes during ocular GVHD , but treatment only abrogated other facets of ocular surface disease in female mice . This dimorphic outcome may reflect insufficient maintenance of C3 depletion in the ocular surface microenvironment , as animals were only treated twice weekly . Furthermore , complement activity is reportedly limited by terminal pathway components in female mice compared to males ( Kotimaa et al . , 2016 ) . Collectively , our data suggest that sensory nerve involvement may be a unique facet and treatment target in ocular GVHD . While the complement pathway has many components , C3 is the heart of the pathway and its activation products mediate virtually all downstream pathway functions . Accordingly , we used CVF to target complement activation in models of HSV-1 keratitis and ocular GVHD as a proof of concept for local delivery of complement-targeted therapeutics for ocular surface disease . In contrast to the neurotoxic effects of complete cobra venom , purified CVF is a \u2018nontoxic\u2019 derivative . CVF forms a biochemically stable convertase to rapidly hydrolyze mammalian C3 and C5 . This ultimately results in complement inactivation via effector consumption ( Vogel and Fritzinger , 2010 ) . The only recorded side effect of purified CVF administration in rodents is transitory anaphylatoxin-mediated pulmonary inflammation resulting in acute respiratory distress ( Proctor et al . , 2006; Vogel and Fritzinger , 2010 ) . In our hands , respiratory distress was observed in some mice following the initial sub-conjunctival CVF injection irrespective of group assignment ( animals were euthanized ) . However , topical CVF administration did not provoke respiratory or corneal abnormalities in any animals . Previous findings also show that topical CVF administration has no obvious effects on corneal health or transparency ( Zaidi et al . , 2010 ) . Experimental CVF administration was once thought to directly stimulate T cells , but such effects were later attributed to mitogen contamination ( Rumjanek et al . , 1978; Cauvi et al . , 2012 ) . Because our disease models were T cell-dependent , we utilized highly-purified CVF from a commercial source for our studies . Moreover , we found no evidence to suggest that CVF impacted T cell responses outside of the eye . Local CVF treatment reduced corneal T cell infiltration following HSV-1 infection ( Figure 5G ) . However , this is likely due to reduced inflammation overall in C3-depleted corneas ( Figure 5D ) . Likewise , ocular CVF treatment in the GVHD model did not impact on the total numbers of T cells in the corneas at the experiment endpoint . However , we have not excluded the possibility that CVF treatment may delay the tempo of T cell influx . Nonetheless , CVF administration preserved corneal sensation in both disease models . By addressing the \u2018heart\u2019 of the complement pathway ( C3 ) , this study opens the door to future investigation to further elucidate the relevant pathomechanisms and corresponding therapeutic targets . The relevant complement activation pathways ( classical , alternative , lectin , terminal ) , cellular targets , and impacts of anaphylatoxin receptor signaling are topics of future investigation . Complement activation is a double-edged sword in the cornea , as activation can be either protective or harmful . Low-level complement turnover is observed in healthy corneas/tears , and complement may even contribute to the relative \u2018paucibacterial\u2019 state of the ocular surface microbiome ( Doan et al . , 2016; McDermott , 2013; Willcox et al . , 1997 ) . The mechanisms regulating each complement-mediated effect remain incompletely understood . Elucidation of how complement activation is triggered , the relevant molecular mechanisms of its downstream signaling , and contributions to pathology will promote an important advancement in drug development for ocular surface disease . Animal models are necessary for mechanistic studies when it comes to understanding complement pathway regulation , especially in dynamic tissue microenvironments; however , differences in complement regulation exist between mouse and man that will also have to be resolved to further assess the translational potential ( Jacobson and Weis , 2008 ) . This certainly applies to putative complement-targeted therapeutics for ocular surface treatment . Even among individual patients , small nucleotide polymorphisms evoke changes in complement activity that have major impacts on disease risks . Such genetic linkages , dubbed \u2018complotype , \u2019 are important in differential susceptibility to AMD ( Harris et al . , 2012; Paun et al . , 2016 ) . Accordingly , complotype differences may help explain differential susceptibility patterns in a variety of ocular surface diseases . Our data herein have demonstrated successful prophylactic intervention in repressing complement-mediated sensory nerve pathology in two well characterized experimental T cell-dependent corneal disease models . Other avenues of future investigation are also needed to determine the efficacy of therapeutic intervention on established ocular surface diseases . Successful implementation of complement-targeted therapeutics for topical ophthalmic use may provide the benefit of controlling insidious ocular surface diseases without the risks associated with systemic therapies . \n Mouse strains were originally purchased from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) . These include: C57BL/6 , C3-/- ( stock #029661 ) , TCR\u03b1-/- ( stock # 002116 ) , OT-II ( stock #004194 ) , MAFIA/CSF1R-GFP ( stock #005070 ) , C3 . SW-H2b ( stock #000438 ) , and B6-GFP ( stock #003291 ) . Colonies were maintained in select-pathogen-free vivaria at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center or Duke University Medical Center . Research was performed in accordance with protocols approved by respective institutional animal care and use committees . For all procedures relating to ocular HSV-1 infection , C57BL/6-background mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and euthanized by cardiac perfusion ( Royer et al . , 2018 ) . For infection , corneas were scratched to expose the epithelium and 1000 plaque forming units ( PFU ) of HSV-1 McKrae was applied to each eye . Viral stocks were propagated and infectious titers quantified by standard plaque assay on Vero cells ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA ) as previously reported ( Royer et al . , 2015 ) . For adoptive transfers , T cells were purified from splenocyte preparations using a BioRad S3e cell sorter ( Hercules , CA ) . Corneal complement C3 depletion was achieved by subconjunctival injection of CVF ( Cat . # 233552 , Millipore Sigma , Burlington , MA ) followed by topical maintenance dosing as described in respective figure legends . Allergic eye disease was initiated in B6 mice as previously described ( Ahadome et al . , 2016; Lee et al . , 2015; Schlereth et al . , 2012 ) . Briefly , hypersensitivity was elicited via intraperitoneal immunization with 10 \u03bcg ovalbumin ( OVA ) adjuvanted with 1 mg Alum and 300 ng pertussis toxin ( all from Sigma-Aldrich Corp . , St . Louis , MO ) . Ocular allergy was subsequently induced via daily eyedrop challenge containing 250 \u03bcg OVA ( Figure 6A ) . Clinical signs of AED were scored daily using established criteria ( Schlereth et al . , 2012 ) . Animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation for tissue collection . Induction of GVHD was based on an established T-dependent , MHC-matched unrelated donor model ( Perez et al . , 2016 ) . Briefly , C3-SW . H2b mice were lethally irradiated ( 10 . 5 Gy , Cs-137 ) and reconstituted with 5 \u00d7 106 T cell-depleted bone marrow ( TCD-BM ) cells from allogeneic C57BL/6 ( H2b ) mice . T cell depletion was achieved using BD anti-mouse CD90 . 2 IMag particles ( Cat . # 551518 , San Jose , CA ) . Control groups received TCD-BM only , but GVHD onset required reconstitution with TCD-BM and T cells . T cells were isolated from B6 splenocytes using immunomagnetic microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec , San Diego , CA ) targeting CD4 ( Cat . #130-049-201 ) , CD8 ( Cat . #130-116-478 ) , or CD90 . 2 ( Cat . #130-049-101 ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . Cell purity was evaluated by flow cytometry ( ~80% ) and adjusted such that 1 . 3 \u00d7 106 CD4+ or CD8+ T cells or 2 . 3 \u00d7 106 CD3+ T cells were injected into each recipient with TCD-BM . Irradiated animals received water containing gentamicin ( 6 . 6 \u03bcg/ml ) for ten days following irradiation ( Henry Schein Animal Health , Dublin , OH ) . Supplical nutritional paste ( Henry Schein ) was also provided ad libitum to reduce weight loss . Systemic manifestations of GVHD were scored using established criteria ( Perez et al . , 2016 ) and ocular disease scored according to Table 2 . Corneal mechano-sensory function was measured on non-anesthetized mice with a Luneau Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer ( Western Ophthalmics , Lynwood , WA ) in 0 . 5 cm increments on a scale of 0 to 6 cm as previously described ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015 ) . Sensation scores reflect the longest filament length capable of eliciting replicate blink reflexes when applied to the central cornea . A Bioptigen spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) system ( Leica Microsystems , Buffalo Grove , IL ) was utilized to evaluate corneal inflammation and edema in vivo ( Downie et al . , 2014 ) . Digital photography of the external eye was captured with a Leica MZ16 FA stereomicroscope . Corneal nerves were imaged in flat-mounted corneal buttons as described ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , corneas were harvested with the limbus intact , fixed , permeabilized , and labeled with Abcam anti-mouse beta-III tubulin primary antibody ( Cat . # ab18207 , Cambridge , MA ) and a corresponding AlexaFluor647-conjugated secondary antibody ( Cat . # 711-605-152 , Jackson Immunoresearch , West Grove , PA ) . Corneas were also labeled with an eBioscience FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD3\u03b5 antibody ( ThermoFisher , Waltham , MA ) . Slides were imaged using an Olympus Fluoview1200 laser scanning confocal ( Center Valley , PA ) or a Nikon AR1 HD resonant scanning confocal ( Melville , NY ) microscope with sequential channel scanning . Confocal z-stack images were evaluated using Imaris software ( Bitplane , Concord , MA ) to quantify corneal nerves densities and the total numbers of CD3+ cells . Briefly , images were displayed as maximum intensity projections . Nerve volume per field of view was measured with the \u2018create surface tool\u2019 with manual thresholding for voxel area coverage of \u03b2III tubulin+ fibers ( default parameters; smooth surface area detail set to 0 . 5 \u03bcm; background subtraction set to 8 . 0 \u03bcm ) . Total CD3+ cells were quantified using the spots tool with default parameters , an estimated cell diameter of 8 \u03bcm , and classification using the quality filter method with manual thresholding . Morphometric nerve volume and cell count summary statistics were reported by the software per image ( 20x field of view ) . Nerve densities were normalized to the respective control group average . Secondary lymphoid organs were harvested and mechanically processed into single-cell suspensions ( Royer et al . , 2015 ) . Blood was collected from the facial vein and treated with erythrocyte lysis buffer prior to labeling . Corneas were digested in RPMI1640 media containing 0 . 26 W\u00fcnsch units of Roche LiberaseTL enzyme blend ( Sigma Aldrich ) at 37\u00b0 C as described ( Royer et al . , 2017 ) . Cell suspensions were filtered and labeled with Fc block and fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies ( eBioscience ) . In vitro T cell functional assays were performed as previously described ( Royer et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , cells were stimulated using 50 ng PMA and 800 ng ionomycin for three hours and monensin added after one hour ( BD Biosciences ) . Intracellular IFN\u03b3 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry using a BD cytofix/cytoperm staining kit . Samples were analyzed on a Miltenyi Biotec MacsQuant10 or a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer with MacsQuantify or FacsDiva software , respectively . For downstream gene expression studies , cornea digests were fractionated with Miltenyi microbeads by sequentially targeting CD45 ( Cat . # 130-052-301 ) and EpCAM ( Cat . # 130-105-958 ) as described ( Royer et al . , 2018 ) . Alternatively , GFP-expressing cells were purified or depleted using a BioRad S3e cell sorter . Tissues were harvested and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 1x Calbiochem protease inhibitor cocktail ( Millipore Sigma ) . Serum was obtained by collecting blood from the facial vein into BD microtainer serum separator tubes . Tissue homogenates and serum were clarified by centrifugation at 10 , 000\u00d7g . Chemokine concentrations were determined using a BioRad Luminex system and Millipore Milliplex MAP technology . Concentrations of C3 were measured by ELISA ( Abcam , Cat . # ab157711 ) . Gene expression studies were performed using RNA isolated from tissue and cells using the Trizol ( ThermoFisher ) method and converted to cDNA with iScript ( BioRad ) . Real-time PCR was performed using PrimePCR technology with commercially validated primer sequences ( Biorad ) and a Biorad CFX-Connect thermocycler as directed . Relative expression was calculated using the 2\u2013\u0394\u0394Ct method with GAPDH ( glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ) as a reference gene . Final PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and imaged with an Azure Biosystems C-series gel documentation system ( Dublin , CA ) to confirm C3 expression in cell subsets . All data were evaluated using Prism six software ( GraphPad , San Diego , CA ) . Statistical tests and post hoc analyses utilized are listed in each figure legend . Significance thresholds are indicated as follows *=P\u00a0<\u00a00 . 05 , **=P\u00a0<\u00a00 . 01 , ***=P\u00a0<\u00a00 . 001 for all data . Supporting data are available online ."}
{"headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["microbiology and infectious disease", "immunology and inflammation"], "id": "elife-04494-v1", "summary": "The immune system protects an individual from invading bacteria , viruses and parasites , as well as malfunctioning or cancerous host cells . However , some people inherit genetic defects that cause part of the immune system to be missing or to not work properly . This is called a genetic immunodeficiency , and puts individuals at a higher risk of infection and disease . The symptoms of immunodeficiencies can vary substantially between individuals , even when they have defects in the same gene . For example , only some of the individuals who have defects in both of their copies of a gene called HOIL-1\u2014which has been linked to several roles in the body's immune response\u2014are reported to suffer from an altered susceptibility to bacterial infections and chronic ( persistent ) inflammation . Gaining a clear understanding of the possible factors that influence such variations in the symptoms of genetic immune deficiencies could help to speed up their diagnosis , as well as helping to develop more effective treatments . MacDuff et al . studied mice that had mutations in both copies of the mouse equivalent of the HOIL-1 gene . These mice , when raised in a clean barrier facility that reduces their exposure to viruses , were severely immunodeficient and died when infected by certain bacteria and parasites , including Listeria monocytogenes . However , they were able to tolerate infections with a herpesvirus or the bacterium that causes tuberculosis . The immunodeficiency to L . monocytogenes was linked to problems producing protective molecules called cytokines , which form a crucial part of the immune response . Unexpectedly , MacDuff et al . found that a chronic herpesvirus infection substantially protected these very immunodeficient animals from infection with Listeria monocytogenes , and the mice were able to efficiently produce protective cytokines . Mice with two other distinct genetic deficiencies that affect their immune system were also better able to survive otherwise lethal bacterial infections if they had a long-term herpesvirus infection . Macduff et al . suggest that the chronic herpesvirus infection stimulates the immune system , and so allows it to compensate for the lack of cytokine production associated with various immunodeficiencies , including those caused by mutations in the HOIL-1 gene . This suggests that the presence of viruses or other long-term infections may be responsible for some of the variability seen in the symptoms of different individuals with the same genetic immunodeficiency . This is an important concept since essentially all humans have life-long chronic infections from various herpesviruses , as well as other viruses that form the human virome .", "source": "Variation in the presentation of hereditary immunodeficiencies may be explained by genetic or environmental factors . Patients with mutations in HOIL1 ( RBCK1 ) present with amylopectinosis-associated myopathy with or without hyper-inflammation and immunodeficiency . We report that barrier-raised HOIL-1-deficient mice exhibit amylopectin-like deposits in the myocardium but show minimal signs of hyper-inflammation . However , they show immunodeficiency upon acute infection with Listeria monocytogenes , Toxoplasma gondii or Citrobacter rodentium . Increased susceptibility to Listeria was due to HOIL-1 function in hematopoietic cells and macrophages in production of protective cytokines . In contrast , HOIL-1-deficient mice showed enhanced control of chronic Mycobacterium tuberculosis or murine \u03b3-herpesvirus 68 ( MHV68 ) , and these infections conferred a hyper-inflammatory phenotype . Surprisingly , chronic infection with MHV68 complemented the immunodeficiency of HOIL-1 , IL-6 , Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-deficient mice following Listeria infection . Thus chronic herpesvirus infection generates signs of auto-inflammation and complements genetic immunodeficiency in mutant mice , highlighting the importance of accounting for the virome in genotype-phenotype studies . \n HOIL-1 ( encoded by the RBCK1 gene ) , HOIP ( RNF31 ) and SHARPIN form the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex ( LUBAC ) , which linearly ubiquitinates receptor signaling complex components such as NEMO to enhance NF-\u03baB activation after engagement of immune receptors including TNF-R1 , IL-1R , CD40 , TLRs and NOD2 ( Tokunaga et al . , 2011; Tokunaga et al . , 2009; Ikeda et al . , 2011; Gerlach et al . , 2011; Haas et al . , 2009; Zak et al . , 2011; Hostager et al . , 2011; Boisson et al . , 2012; Damgaard et al . , 2012; Tian et al . , 2007 ) . Recently , HOIL-1/LUBAC was also shown to be important for activation of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome in macrophages via linear ubiquitination of ASC ( Rodgers et al . , 2014 ) . These data suggest that HOIL-1 plays multiple roles in inflammation and infection . In mice , SHARPIN deficiency results in auto-inflammation involving multiple organs including the liver , esophagus , lung and , most noticeably , chronic proliferative dermatitis of the skin ( Seymour et al . , 2007 ) . The development and organization of secondary lymphoid organs and antibody isotype switching are also impaired in these mice ( HogenEsch et al . , 1999 ) . Loss of HOIP catalytic activity in B cells results in the impaired development of B1 B cells and antibody responses to antigen ( Sasaki et al . , 2013 ) . However , HOIL-1-deficient mice have not been analyzed extensively to date . Sixteen patients with bi-allelic mutations in the gene encoding HOIL-1 have been reported ( Boisson et al . , 2012; Nilsson et al . , 2013; Wang et al . , 2013 ) . Three patients exhibited cardiomyopathy , amylopectinosis , hyper-inflammation and mild immunodeficiency associated with an increased frequency of bacterial infections , whereas other patients presented with amylopectinosis and myopathy alone ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The role of HOIL-1 in inflammation and immunity to infection in vivo is , therefore , uncertain . Although there are multiple possible explanations for the variable clinical presentations of the reported patients including hypomorphic expression of HOIL-1 or effects of mutations on protein function , another possibility was that environmental factors alter the clinical presentation of HOIL-1 deficiency . In this study we define the function of HOIL-1 in murine immunity to infection and explore the potential role of the virome in determining HOIL-1 deficiency-associated phenotypes . The bacterial microbiome and the virome regulate inflammation and immunity ( Virgin , 2014; Virgin et al . , 2009; Belkaid and Hand , 2014 ) . Within the virome , herpesviruses persistently infect most humans , and exert significant effects on innate immunity in mice during experimental chronic infection , including increasing resistance to tumors and a range of pathogens ( Barton et al . , 2007; White et al . , 2010; Yager et al . , 2009; Nguyen et al . , 2008; Haque et al . , 2004 ) . However , the potential effects of chronic infection on the phenotypic manifestations of immune deficiencies have not been considered . In this study , we show that chronic herpesvirus infection can alter the presentation of several genetic immunodeficiencies in mice . We first found that , in na\u00efve mice , HOIL-1 is essential during infection with Listeria monocytogenes , Toxoplasma gondii and Citrobacter rodentium and for efficient induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are known to be essential for resistance to lethal infection by hematopoietic cells during Listeria infection . In contrast , HOIL-1 knock-out ( KO ) mice , with null mutations in the Rbck1 gene that encodes HOIL-1 , were resistant to infection with murine \u03b3-herpesvirus 68 ( MHV68 ) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Although HOIL-1 KO mice raised in a barrier facility did not display signs of auto-inflammation , chronic infection with MHV68 or M . tuberculosis resulted in elevated inflammatory cytokines circulating in the serum , similar to that observed in some patients with mutations in RBCK1 ( HOIL1 ) . Interestingly , latent infection with MHV68 rescued HOIL-1 deficient mice from lethality during Listeria infection and induced high levels of the protective cytokine , interferon-gamma ( IFN\u03b3 ) . MHV68 latency also protected IL-6 , Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11 deficient mice from Listeria-induced lethality , indicating that the ability of latent infection to complement a genetic immunodeficiency is not restricted to mutation of Hoil-1 . These data indicate that chronic infections can modify the clinical presentations of genetic variations , thereby opening a new avenue for the analysis and interpretation of human genotype-phenotype association studies . We speculate that the protective effect of chronic herpesvirus infection is due to the stimulation of the function of the innate immune system in a manner that compensates for deficient early cytokine responses associated with multiple immunodeficiencies . \n HOIL-1 KO mice ( Tokunaga et al . , 2009 ) were born at Mendelian ratios and , in contrast to SHARPIN-deficient mice , failed to develop TNF\u03b1-driven inflammatory skin disease ( Ikeda et al . , 2011; Gerlach et al . , 2011; Tokunaga et al . , 2011; Tokunaga and Iwai , 2012 ) and exhibited normal histology of lymphoid organs , liver , lung , and kidney , and the presence of Peyer's patches along the small intestine ( not shown ) . Aged HOIL-1 KO mice exhibited deposits of material that stained with periodic acid-Schiff reagent and was resistant to digestion with diastase , similar to the amylopectin-like material observed in humans with HOIL-1 deficiency ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) ( Boisson et al . , 2012 ) . Importantly , these barrier-raised mice showed minimal signs of baseline hyper-inflammation . In this regard , HOIL-1 KO mice exhibited normal numbers of lymphoid and myeloid cells in the spleen and thymus , normal complete blood counts ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A , B , D ) , and no detectable increase of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF\u03b1 ) or interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) in serum ( discussed below ) . However , in the peritoneum , HOIL-1 KO mice contained about twofold more B cells , T cells and resident macrophages without changes in other cell types ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C ) . Expression of neighboring genes , Trib3 and Tbc1d20 , was unaffected by disruption of the Rbck1 ( Hoil1 ) gene ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . To determine the requirement for HOIL-1 during the immune response to infection in vivo , we challenged HOIL-1 KO mice with a number of different pathogens . Strikingly , HOIL-1 KO mice were highly susceptible to even low dose infection with the facultative gram-positive intracellular bacterium , Listeria monocytogenes ( Listeria ) , with 80% , 80% and 50% of mice succumbing to infection within 10 days of intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) inoculation with 105 , 104 and 103 CFU , respectively ( Figure 1A ) . Although bacterial burdens in the spleens and livers of control and HOIL-1 KO mice were similar 1 and 3 days post-infection with 105 CFU , bacterial CFUs were elevated in HOIL-1 KO mice by 6 days post-infection , indicating that HOIL-1 KO mice were unable to control and clear the bacteria ( Figure 1B ) . Further , these mutant mice developed large inflammatory lesions in the liver , elevated liver enzymes in the serum , and widespread tissue destruction in the spleen ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5 , not shown ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 006Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 011 HOIL-1 KO mice were also highly susceptible to infection with a relatively avirulent type II strain of the intracellular apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii ( T . gondii ) ( Figure 1C ) . Despite infection with 5000 parasites resulting in lethality in only 20% of control mice , 100 parasites was sufficient to induce lethality in 100% of HOIL-1 KO mice . Quantification of parasite-encoded luciferase expression in vivo revealed that HOIL-1 KO mice failed to control T . gondii replication by 8 days post-infection ( Figure 1D ) . HOIL-1 KO mice also succumbed to infection with the enteric gram-negative pathogen Citrobacter rodentium , whereas control mice were highly resistant ( Figure 1E , F ) . These data indicated that loss of HOIL-1 expression confers profound immunodeficiency in barrier-raised mice . To define the role of HOIL-1 in immunity , we examined the response to Listeria in more detail . One patient with HOIL-1-associated immunodeficiency showed signs of recovery from hyper-inflammation after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( Boisson et al . , 2012 ) . In mice , reciprocal bone marrow transplantation revealed that expression of HOIL-1 in radiation-sensitive hematopoietic cells was critical for resistance to Listeria ( Figure 2A , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We noted that control mice that received control bone marrow were slightly more susceptible to infection than non-irradiated control mice ( compare with Figure 1A ) , suggesting that reconstitution does not fully restore the immune system of a lethally irradiated mouse to that of a non-irradiated animal . Despite this caveat , irradiated wild-type control mice that received HOIL-1 KO bone marrow and were challenged with 105 Listeria 8 weeks later succumbed to infection at the same rate as HOIL-1 KO mice that had received HOIL-1 KO bone marrow . HOIL-1 KO mice that received control bone marrow had an increased survival rate , but still succumbed more readily than control mice that received control bone marrow . These data indicate that , while HOIL-1 expression is essential in bone marrow-derived cells , HOIL-1 may also play a role in radiation resistant cells during Listeria infection . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 012Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 014 To determine whether HOIL-1 deficiency resulted in a defect in innate or adaptive immunity , we bred the HOIL-1 KO mice onto a RAG1-deficient background . T and B cell-deficient RAG1 HOIL-1 double KO mice succumbed to infection significantly faster than RAG1 KO mice ( Figure 2B ) , and exhibited elevated bacterial burden in the spleen and liver 3 days post-infection ( Figure 2C ) , indicating that HOIL-1 plays an essential role in innate immunity during Listeria infection . Indeed , HOIL-1-deficient mice succumbed to infection at the same rate regardless of the presence or absence of the adaptive immune system ( compare Figures 1A and 2B ) . Further , HOIL-1 KO mice immunized with a low dose of Listeria were capable of mounting a protective adaptive response to a high dose secondary challenge with Listeria 28 days later ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . We noted that 1000 CFU administered i . p . was a borderline dose required to successfully immunize control mice in our experiments , despite being sufficient to induce lethality in 50% of HOIL-1 KO mice ( Figure 1A ) . Together , these data do not rule out a role for HOIL-1 in adaptive immunity , but show that HOIL-1 plays a major role in hematopoietic cells to foster innate immunity to Listeria infection . Innate immunity to Listeria in mice depends on tissue-resident macrophages and CD8\u03b1+ dendritic cells responding to Listeria infection by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF\u03b1 , IL-12 , and IL-6 . These cytokines are each well recognized to be essential for survival after Listeria infection ( Unanue , 1997; Williams et al . , 2012 ) through their role in coordinating activation of NK cells , NKT cell and T cells to produce IFN\u03b3 required for the bactericidal activity of phagocytic cells . Therefore , to further define a role for HOIL-1 in the innate immune system , we determined whether HOIL-1 KO bone marrow-derived macrophages ( macrophages herein ) produced cytokines in response to Listeria infection with or without IFN\u03b3 treatment . Compared to control cells , HOIL-1 KO macrophages secreted only 50% , 20% and 10% of the expected levels of TNF\u03b1 , IL-6 and IL-12p70 protein , respectively ( Figure 3A ) . Consistent with a role for HOIL-1 in the activation of the NF-\u03baB transcription factor following TLR stimulation , Listeria-infected HOIL-1 KO macrophages expressed decreased levels of Tnf , Il6 and Il12b mRNA ( Figure 3B ) . The defects in cytokine transcript levels were of smaller magnitude than the decreases in secreted protein , particularly for Tnf , suggesting that HOIL-1 may also be involved in cytokine translation or secretion . However , HOIL-1 KO macrophages killed Listeria after activation with IFN\u03b3 as effectively as control cells , indicating the selectivity of HOIL-1 effects on macrophage function ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 015Figure 3 .

Each symbol represents an individual mouse . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 018 We confirmed that induction of Tnf and Il6 mRNA was significantly impaired following Listeria infection in vivo by measuring cytokine transcripts in peritoneal cells from mice 3 to 12 hr after infection ( Figure 3C ) . This reduction in cytokine transcripts could not be explained by a decrease in macrophage numbers ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Surprisingly , Il12b transcript levels were similar in HOIL-1 KO mice , with a significant difference being detected at only 6 hr after infection . Similar decreases in Tnf and Il6 mRNA were observed in mice on the Rag1\u2212/\u2212 background at 3 hr post-infection , confirming that these differences are due to a defect in innate immunity in the absence of HOIL-1 ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . We also noted that fewer NK cells and neutrophils were present in the peritoneum 6 hr after Listeria infection , suggesting delayed recruitment or proliferation of these cell types ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . These decreases in cytokine production and delayed cell recruitment likely synergize with defects in IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 signaling observed by others ( Tian et al . , 2007; Haas et al . , 2009; Tokunaga et al . , 2009 , 2011 ) to compromise antibacterial immunity , and may contribute to the impaired induction of Ifng mRNA observed by 12 hr ( Figure 3C ) . These data indicate that HOIL-1 plays a critical role in coordinating essential early cytokine responses after Listeria infection . The above data demonstrate that HOIL-1 KO mice have a severe immunodeficiency after certain types of infection . To assess the generality of this phenotype we infected HOIL-1 KO mice with murine \u03b3-herpesvirus 68 ( MHV68 ) , a genetic relative of the common persistent human herpesviruses , Epstein\u2013Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( EBV , KSHV ) ( Barton et al . , 2011; Speck and Ganem , 2010 ) . HOIL-1 KO mice survived MHV68 infection for at least 3 months . MHV68 replication was unaffected by HOIL-1 deficiency in cultured macrophages , and was suppressed only slightly in vivo ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Despite normal establishment of latency as determined by the number of cells carrying MHV68 genome 28 days after infection ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , the efficiency of MHV68 reactivation from latency in explanted peritoneal cells was significantly impaired ( approximately 50-fold , Figure 4A ) . Similarly , HOIL-1 KO mice failed to succumb to infection with M . tuberculosis over 70 days of infection , and in fact exhibited lower bacterial colony counts in the spleen while counts in the lung were no different than controls ( Figure 4B ) . Thus HOIL-1 KO mice are fully able to control , and may have an enhanced ability to control , specific aspects of acute and chronic MHV68 and M . tuberculosis infection , in striking contrast to the immunodeficiency apparent after infection with Listeria , Toxoplasma , and Citrobacter . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 003Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 005 The ability of HOIL-1 KO mice to effectively control chronic herpesvirus infection allowed us to test the hypothesis that persistent virus infection might alter two phenotypes , hyper-inflammation and immunodeficiency , in which HOIL-1 KO mice appear to differ from some reported patients with bi-allelic mutations in RBCK1 ( HOIL1 ) ( Boisson et al . , 2012 ) . Notably , patients with HOIL-1 deficiency and hyper-inflammation exhibited increased expression of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 in the serum and increased expression of mRNA for Il6 in blood cells ( Boisson et al . , 2012 ) . We therefore examined the serum of MHV68-infected HOIL-1 KO mice for cytokines essential for resistance to Listeria but deficient in Listeria-infected HOIL-1 KO mice . As previously observed ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) , latent infection of control mice with MHV68 was associated with an increase in circulating levels of TNF\u03b1 , IL-6 , IL-12 and IFN\u03b3 compared with uninfected mice ( Figure 4C ) . In HOIL-1 KO mice , MHV68 latently resulted in small but significant increases in TNF\u03b1 , IL-6 and IL-12p70 levels , and a more striking increase in IFN\u03b3 levels compared to latently infected controls . HOIL-1 KO mice chronically infected with M . tuberculosis also exhibited increased expression of both IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 in serum at 70 days post-infection ( Figure 4D ) . Therefore , there is an overlap between cytokines expressed in hyper-inflammatory patients and in chronically-infected HOIL-1 KO mice . MHV68 latency has been shown previously to induce symbiotic protection against Listeria infection in wild-type mice ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) . Because expression of TNF\u03b1 , IL-6 and IFN\u03b3 are essential for control of Listeria infection in mice ( Kopf et al . , 1994; Unanue , 1997; Williams et al . , 2012 ) , and were impaired in Listeria-infected HOIL-1 KO mice ( Figure 3C ) , but elevated in MHV68-infected HOIL-1 KO mice , we considered whether chronic MHV68 infection could complement the profound immunodeficiency observed in Listeria-infected barrier-raised HOIL-1 KO mice . As observed previously ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) , MHV68 latency , 1 month after infection , protected control mice from an otherwise lethal dose of Listeria ( Figure 5A ) . MHV68 latency also protected HOIL-1 KO mice from a dose of Listeria at least 1000-fold higher than the LD50 for MHV68-negative mice ( Figures 5A and 1A ) . Both control and HOIL-1 KO mice were still partially protected from Listeria challenge 6 months after MHV68 infection ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . A viral mutant capable of acute lytic infection but unable to efficiently establish latency ( ORF73 . stop ) ( Moorman et al . , 2003 ) was unable to efficiently protect HOIL-1 KO or control mice from Listeria infection , demonstrating that latent MHV68 is required to complement HOIL-1-associated immunodeficiency to Listeria ( Figure 5B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 019Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 022 To determine whether MHV68 latency rescued pro-inflammatory cytokine induction by HOIL-1 KO mice following Listeria infection , we quantitated cytokine transcripts in peritoneal cells from latently infected mice before ( Figure 5C ) and 3 hr after ( Figure 5D ) infection with Listeria . As predicted from the cytokine levels in the serum , MHV68 latency resulted in small but significant increases in Tnf , Il6 and Il12b transcripts prior to Listeria challenge ( Figure 5C ) . While MHV68 latency did not rescue the induction of Tnf or Il6 transcripts in HOIL-1 KO mice following infection with Listeria , Il12b transcript levels were increased approximately twofold , and were comparable to levels in control mice . More significantly , Ifng and Nos2 ( encoding iNOS ) transcripts were elevated approximately 200-fold and 1000-fold , respectively , in latently infected control and HOIL-1 KO mice ( Figure 5C ) , and further induced by 3 hr after infection with Listeria ( Figure 5D ) . Ifng transcript levels were significantly higher in latently infected HOIL-1 KO mice following infection with Listeria than in control mice . These data suggest that MHV68 latency by-passes the requirement for TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 during early Listeria infection by enhancing the induction of IFN\u03b3 and downstream effector molecules important for controlling Listeria infection . To test whether peritoneal macrophages from latently infected HOIL-1 KO mice had an increased capacity to kill Listeria , we explanted peritoneal macrophages from mock or latently infected mice , infected them with Listeria , killed extracellular bacteria with gentamycin treatment , and compared the number of CFU at 6 hr to the number of CFU at the beginning of the experiment . As expected , cells from mock infected control mice exhibited mild listericidal activity and cells from latently infected control mice had an enhanced ability to kill Listeria ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 , ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) ) . Macrophages from mock-infected HOIL-1 KO mice had a slightly impaired ability to control Listeria infection . However , MHV68 latency in HOIL-1 KO mice enhanced the ability of macrophages to kill Listeria , generating a capacity to kill similar to that observed with macrophages from control mice . Together , these data suggest that MHV68 latency induces an environment that enhances the ability of HOIL-1-deficient cells to kill and respond to Listeria . To determine whether the viral complementation of immunodeficiency was unique to HOIL-1 , we latently infected IL-6 , Caspase-1-deficient and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-double-deficient mice ( Kayagaki et al . , 2013 ) , which survive MHV68 infection but are all highly susceptible to Listeria infection ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3 ) ( Kopf et al . , 1994; Sarawar et al . , 1998; Edelson and Unanue , 2002; Tsuji et al . , 2004; Sauer et al . , 2011 ) . IL-6 , Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-deficient mice were also protected from lethality following Listeria infection by chronic MHV68 infection ( Figure 5E , F ) . These data indicate that the capacity of chronic MHV68 to reverse a significant immunodeficiency is not restricted to mutations in Rbck1 ( Hoil1 ) , and suggest that chronic viral infections may alter phenotypes of many host allelic variants . \n We report that HOIL-1 is essential during infection with Listeria , T . gondii and C . rodentium , but not with MHV68 or M . tuberculosis in mice . Expression of HOIL-1 was critical in innate , hematopoietic-derived cells during Listeria infection in vivo . The requirement of HOIL-1 for the induction of protective inflammatory cytokines , TNF\u03b1 , IL-6 and IL-12 , following infection of macrophages with Listeria in vitro is consistent with reports that LUBAC is required for efficient NF-\u03baB activation following TLR engagement ( Zak et al . , 2011; Boisson et al . , 2012 ) , but not with a recent report that NF-\u03baB activation following stimulation of TLR4 and TNF-R1 on macrophages by LPS and TNF\u03b1 , respectively , is unaffected by HOIL-1 deficiency ( Rodgers et al . , 2014 ) . These apparently conflicting results suggest that HOIL-1 and LUBAC may not only have cell-type specific functions ( Boisson et al . , 2012; Rodgers et al . , 2014 ) , but also stimulus-specific roles that vary between different cell types . This may be further highlighted by the excessive inflammatory response and enhanced control of MHV68 and M . tuberculosis infection\u2014two pathogens that also infect macrophages\u2014by HOIL-1-deficient mice . It has been proposed that low levels of viral reactivation during MHV68 latency are responsible for the low level of constant immune activation and cytokine production ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) . It is paradoxical , then , that reactivation is almost undetectable in HOIL-1-deficient animals , and yet their inflammatory response is elevated . Since the negative regulator of NF-\u03baB signaling , A20 , binds to linear ubiquitin chains ( Tokunaga et al . , 2012; Verhelst et al . , 2012 ) , HOIL-1/LUBAC may also be important for recruiting A20 to receptor signaling complexes to turn off signaling . Therefore , receptor signaling may be sustained in cells in HOIL-1 KO mice , resulting in the increase in TNF\u03b1 , IL-6 and IL-12 , and ultimately IFN\u03b3 protein , observed in the serum of chronically infected mice . Decreased viral reactivation may be the result of this increased IFN\u03b3 , the inability of latently infected cells to response to a stimulus of reactivation or a combination thereof . It is unclear why HOIL-1 KO mice are extremely susceptible to some pathogens , yet control other infections remarkably well . This might be due to HOIL-1/LUBAC having differential roles in transducing signals from different immune sensors stimulated by different infections . Other possibilities include a differential requirement for the innate immune system to hold the acute infection in check while an adaptive response is being generated , the speed at which the pathogen replicates , the tissues that it damages , and whether pathology during acute infection is mostly immune- or pathogen-derived . Further studies will be required to address these possibilities . We further show that chronic infection with MHV68 rescued HOIL-1 , IL-6 , Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-deficient mice from lethal Listeria infection , thereby masking the genetic immunodeficiency observed in MHV68-negative mice . As reported previously ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) , MHV68 latency was associated with increased basal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 , IL-6 , IL-12 and IFN\u03b3 in the serum of wild-type animals , which were further increased in HOIL-1 KO mice . These cytokines appear to increase the activation status of the innate immune system such that their induction following Listeria infection is no longer as important as would be the case in a na\u00efve mouse . Indeed , MHV68 infection did not enhance the transcription of Tnf , and only marginally enhanced the transcription of Il6 and Il12b even in control mice following Listeria infection , and did not rescue the defect in Tnf and Il6 induction observed in HOIL-1 KO mice . Conversely , transcription of Ifng and the effector molecule , iNOS ( encoded by Nos2 ) , was elevated in cells from latently infected mice and enhanced substantially by both HOIL-1 KO and control animals very rapidly following infection with Listeria . Macrophages require priming with IFN\u03b3 to induce IL-12 in response to Listeria infection . In a latently infected animal , IFN\u03b3 is already present and so IL-12 and additional IFN\u03b3 may be induced more rapidly . Furthermore , as reported previously for wild-type mice ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) , MHV68 latency enhanced the ability of peritoneal macrophages from control and HOIL-1 KO mice to kill Listeria . Together , these data suggest that the constant presence of low levels of IFN\u03b3 driven by latent virus infection results in an increase in the basal expression levels of downstream effector molecules and the priming of cells for the enhanced immediate killing of Listeria upon infection , as well as for a more rapid further induction of IFN\u03b3 and its effector molecules in response to the bacterial challenge . In this sense , chronic virus infection sets the level of innate immunity to subsequent infection . HOIL-1 KO mice bred in a high grade barrier facility failed to exhibit certain phenotypes of HOIL-1 deficient patients , specifically by not exhibiting baseline hyper-inflammation and by displaying a striking immunodeficiency out of proportion to that observed in some humans with bi-allelic mutations in RBCK1 ( HOIL1 ) . Most humans are infected life-long with multiple herpesviruses ( Virgin et al . , 2009; Virgin , 2014 ) , and many also carry other chronic or latent infections such as tuberculosis . Importantly , we observed complementation of immunodeficiency to Listeria by chronic herpesvirus infection in four different strains of immunodeficient mice , revealing virus infection as one possible environmental factor that might alter the genotype-phenotype relationship for patients with mutations in immune system genes . HOIL-1 KO mice chronically infected with either a herpesvirus or M . tuberculosis also exhibited increases in some of the same cytokines reported in the serum of HOIL-1 deficient humans . At least three of the HOIL-1 mutant patients were infected with at least one herpesvirus ( Boisson et al . , 2012 ) , and it is likely that other chronic infections were present . However , in the absence of data regarding the complete infection status of the HOIL-1 mutant patients , the relevance of the mouse studies to the human phenotypes is unclear . Nevertheless , perhaps the presence of the virome , and potentially variations in the virome or other chronic infections between people , confers significant phenotypic variation by complementing mutations in host genes responsible for innate immunity ( Virgin , 2014 ) . The genes involved in immunity and inflammation are the most rapidly evolving in the mammalian genome ( Lindblad-Toh et al . , 2011; Casanova et al . , 2013; Quintana-Murci and Clark , 2013 ) . Survival from infection requires a trade-off between alleles that promote or limit inflammation to balance immunity vs immunopathology . We speculate that the virome or other chronic infections hide or enhance the effects of genetic variations in immune responsiveness by complementing chromosomal variations in immune response genes . As the nature of the virome changes in persons growing up in different cultural and economic environments , it is possible that the immunophenotype of the host changes , and the beneficial or deleterious effects of existing genetic variation are unmasked by removal of complementation provided by chronic virus infection . It is also plausible that the striking auto-inflammation observed in humans with a variety of immune defects could be due to even well controlled herpesvirus infection alone or in combination with other chronic infections . Our data suggest that analysis of the metagenome , including the virome , may be of value in linking human phenotype and genotype ( Virgin , 2014; Virgin and Todd , 2011 ) . Recent rapid advances in sequencing and analysis of the metagenome will make integration of data from the virome into human genetic studies practical ( Virgin , 2014 ) . \n HOIL-1 KO mice , with null mutations in the Rbck1 gene that encodes HOIL-1 , have been described previously ( Tokunaga et al . , 2009 ) . C57BL/6J mice or HOIL-1 WT littermates were used as wild type controls . Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) and bred to HOIL-1 KO mice . Il6\u2212/\u2212 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory . Caspase 1;Caspase 11-deficient mice with or without a Caspase 11 transgene were kindly provided by Vishva Dixit , Genentec , San Francisco USA . All mice were housed and bred at Washington University in Saint Louis in specific pathogen-free conditions in accordance with Federal and University guidelines and protocols were approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University under protocol number 20140244 . Mice were inoculated between 8 and 11 weeks of age . L . monocytogenes wild type strain EGD was used for this study . Listeria glycerol stocks were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C , and thawed and diluted into PBS for intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) injection into mice . To determine tissue burden , spleens and livers were homogenized in 10 ml PBS containing 0 . 05% Triton X-100 and serial dilutions were plated on brain heart infusion agar plates . Listeria CFU were counted after overnight growth at 37\u00b0C . Small sections of spleen and liver were also fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histological analysis . The type II Prugniaud strain of T . gondii expressing a firefly luciferase ( PRU-Fluc-GFP , provided by J . Boothroyd , Stanford University , Palo Alto , CA ) ( Saeij et al . , 2005 ) was used in all in vivo T . gondii experiments . Tachyzoites were grown by 2-day serial passage in human foreskin fibroblasts . For infections , freshly egressed parasites were filtered , counted , and injected i . p . into mice . Mice were with inoculated orally with 2 \u00d7 109 CFU C . rodentium strain DBS100 ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) from a fresh culture and monitored for morbidity and mortality . MHV68 WUMS ( ATCC VR1465 ) , MHV68 ORF73 . stop and \u03b3HV68 M3-Fluc were passaged and titered by plaque assay on NIH 3T12 cells . Virus stocks were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C , and thawed and diluted into PBS for i . p . or intranasal ( i . n . ) inoculation of mice . For experiments involving MHV68 ORF73 . stop , i . n . inoculation with 5 \u00d7 104 CFU was performed due to the low titer of the virus stock . To determine \u03b3HV68 titers in tissues , organs were placed in 1 ml of complete DMEM and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C . Samples were thawed prior to disruption with silica beads and virus titration by plaque assay . Before infection , exponentially replicating M . tuberculosis Erdman strain bacteria were washed in PBS + 0 . 05% Tween 80 , and sonicated to disperse clumps . Mice were exposed to 8 \u00d7 107 CFU of M . tuberculosis in an Inhalation Exposure System ( Glas-Col , Terre Haute , IN ) , which delivers \u223c100 bacteria to the lung per animal . After 24 hr post infection , two mice per group were sacrificed , and lungs were harvested to determine infection efficiency , which was about 100 CFU/lung/mouse . Experimental mice were sacrificed 70 days after infection , and lungs and spleen were harvested for CFU , and serum was collected for cytokine analysis . Bacterial burdens were determined by plating serial dilutions of lung and spleen homogenates onto 7H10 agar plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 3 weeks prior to counting colonies . MHV68 reactivation from latency and preformed virus was assayed as described previously ( Weck et al . , 1996 ) . Briefly , peritoneal exudate cells were plated in twofold serial dilutions ( 24-wells per dilution ) onto permissive mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) monolayers and scored for cytopathic effect ( CPE ) 3 weeks later . Reactivation of lytic virus from a peritoneal cell leads to complete CPE of the MEF monolayer . To measure preformed infectious virus in the sample , parallel samples of cells were mechanically disrupted to kill the cells but keep any infectious virus intact . These samples were plated and scored as described above . Using the Poisson distribution , CPE in 63 . 2% of wells indicates that one reactivation event is likely to have occurred per well , and is used to determine the frequency of reactivating cells in the sample . To determine the frequency of cells harboring viral genome , peritoneal cells were assayed by nested PCR for viral genome as described previously ( Weck et al . , 1999 ) . The detection of PCR product in 63 . 2% of wells indicates that one genome was present per well . Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared as described previously ( Hwang et al . , 2012 ) . Briefly , bone marrow was extracted from mouse femurs and allowed to differentiate in DMEM containing 10% FBS , 10% CMG14-12 cell-conditioned media as a source of M-CSF ( Takeshita et al . , 2000 ) , 5% horse serum , 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM L-Glutamine for 7 days . For cytokine and transcript analyses following Listeria infection of macrophages , adherent cells were scraped and seeded in tissue culture-treated plates in the absence of M-CSF . After 3 days , macrophages were infected with 106/ml Listeria in the presence or absence of 100 U/ml IFN\u03b3 . 2 hr post-infection , 50 U/ml Penicillin and 50 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin were added to kill the Listeria . Cell supernatants were harvested at indicated times and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C prior to cytokine analysis . Cells were lyzed in TRI-Reagent for RNA extraction . For Listeria growth/killing assays , macrophages were seeded in non-tissue culture treated dishes in the absence of M-CSF . After 1 day , cells were treated with 300 \u00b5/ml IFN\u03b3 or untreated , and 48 hr later scraped replated on sterile coverslips . After 3 hr , cells were infected with 105/ml Listeria from an overnight standing culture and centifuged to synchronize the infection . 50 \u03bcg/ml gentamycin was added after 30 min to kill extracellular bacteria . At the indicated times , coverslips were washed with warm PBS , then lyzed in 10 ml cold water to release the bacteria . Serial dilutions were plated on brain heart infusion agar plates , and Listeria CFU were counted after overnight growth at 37\u00b0C . For MHV68 growth analysis , adherent cells were scraped and seeded in tissue culture-treated plates in the presence of M-CSF . After 2 days , macrophages were treated with 0 . 1 U/ml IFN\u03b3 or untreated , and 12 hr later infected with MHV68 at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 0 . 05 for 1 hr with occasional rocking at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 . Cells were washed once with medium and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine ( with or without 0 . 1 U/ml IFN\u03b3 ) for the indicated period of time at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 , before being frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C . Virus titers were determined by plaque assay following two freeze\u2013thaw cycles . Cells were flushed from the peritoneum of mice that had been mock infected or infected with MHV68 for 32 days with ice cold DMEM containing 10% FBS and 2 mM L-Glutamine . 5 \u00d7 105 cells were plated on glass coverslips in 24 well plates in duplicate wells per timepoint and allowed to adhere overnight . Non-adherent cells were washed away with warm medium , and the remaining cells were infected with 105 CFU Listeria from a overnight standing culture by spinocculation at 600\u00d7g for 10 min at room temperature , and then incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 . 50 \u03bcg/ml gentamycin was added after 30 min to kill extracellular bacteria . Coverslips were washed in warm PBS prior to hypotonic lysis of the cells in ice cold water to release the bacteria . Serial dilutions were plated on brain heart infusion agar plates , and Listeria CFU were counted after overnight growth at 37\u00b0C . Recipient mice were exposed to 1200 rad of whole body irradiation , and injected intravenously with 10 million whole bone marrow cells from donor mice . Mice were allowed to reconstitute for 8 to 10 weeks before Listeria challenge . Mice were bled at 7 weeks post-irradiation to determine percent chimerism . Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR ) for the presence of Rbck1/Hoil1 intron 7 ( in control cells; 5\u2032-ATG CTG GAG TAG AGG CTG GA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGA CTG CTG CTT GGA GAG TG-3\u2032 ) , or the neomycin-resistance cassette ( in HOIL-1 KO cells; 5\u2032-CAA GAT GGA TTG CAC GCA GG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCA GCC GAT TGT CTG TTG TG-3\u2032 ) . Rag2 was used as a normalization control ( 5\u2032-GGG AGG ACA CTC ACT TGC CAG TA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AGT CAG GAG TCT CCA TCT CAC TGA-3\u2032 ) . Imaging was performed as described previously ( Saeij et al . , 2005 ) . Briefly , mice were injected i . p . with 150 mg/kg D-Luciferin ( Biosynth AG , Switzerland ) and allowed to remain active for 5 min . Animals were subsequently anesthetized with 2% isoflurane for 5 min and then imaged with a Xenogen IVIS 200 machine ( Caliper Life Sciences , Hopkinton , MA ) . Data were analyzed using Living Image software ( Caliper Life Sciences ) . Peritoneal exudate cells were harvested by peritoneal lavage with 10 ml ice cold FACS buffer ( PBS supplemented with 2% FBS and 50 U/ml Penicillin and 50 \u00b5g/ml Streptomycin ) . Splenocytes were isolated by filtering through two 100 \u03bcm cell strainers into 10 ml ice cold FACS buffer . Residual red blood cells were lysed with Red Blood Cell lysis buffer ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) , counted and stained for flow cytometry . Cells were incubated with FACS buffer plus 1% rat serum , 1% hamster serum and 1% Fc-block for 15 min . Surface staining was performed for 30 min at room temperature . Cells were then washed and fixed with 2% formaldehyde . Cells were analyzed on an LSRII or LSR Fortessa flow cytometer ( BD , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software ( Tree Star , Inc , Ashland , OR ) . The following antibodies were used: anti-CD3e ( clone 145-2C11 , Biolegend , San Diego , CA ) , anti-CD4 ( clone RM4-5 , BD Pharmingen ) , anti-CD8 ( clone 53-6 . 7 , Biolegend ) , anti-IgM ( clone II/41 , BD Pharmingen ) , anti-CD19 ( clone 6D5 , Biolegend ) , anti-NK1 . 1 ( clone PK136 , BD Pharmingen ) , anti-NKp46 ( clone 29A1 . 4 , eBioscience , San Diego , CA ) , anti-Ly6C ( clone HK1 . 4 , Biolegend ) , anti-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 , Biolgend , anti-CD11b ( clone M1/70 , BD Pharmingen ) , anti-F4/80 ( clone BM8 , Biolegend ) . Cytokines in mouse serum and cell supernatants were quantitated using a custom Procarta Immunoassay Kit ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA ) and analyzed on a Bio-Plex 200 System ( BioRad , Hercules , CA ) or by ELISA ( BD , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) , respectively , according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions . Spleen sections were homogenized , and macrophages were lysed in TRI-Reagent ( Sigma ) , and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions to isolate total RNA . RNA was isolated from peritoneal cells using RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen , Netherlands ) . RNA samples were treated with Turbo DNA-free DNase ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) prior to first strand cDNA synthesis with ImProm-II ( Promega , Madison , WI ) and random hexamer primers . Quantitative PCR was performed on a StepOnePlus machine using Power SYBR Green master mix ( Applied Biosystems , Waltham , MA ) and primers specific for ribosomal protein S29 ( Rps29; 5\u2032-AGC AGC TCT ACT GGA GTC ACC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AGG TCG CTT AGT CCA ACT TAA TG-3\u2032 ) , Rbck1/Hoil-1 ( 5\u2032-ATT CGG CGG AAT GGA GAC GG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTG GTT GGT CCT GGG CTT CG-3\u2032 ) , Trib3 ( 5\u2032-CAC ACT GCC ACA AGC ACG GG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAC GCA GGC ATC TTC CAG G-3\u2032 ) , Tbc1d20 ( 5\u2032-TGA GGG AGG GCT CCT GAC TG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AGC AGC ACT TGC TGG TAG TCC-3\u2032 ) , Il12b ( 5\u2032-GCA CGG CAG CAG AAT AAA TAT GAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TTC AAA GGC TTC ATC TGC AAG TTC-3\u2032 ) , Tnf ( 5\u2032-GGG TGA TCG GTC CCC AAA GG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032- CTG AGT GTG AGG GTC TGG GC-3\u2032 ) , Il6 ( 5\u2032-GCC AGA GTC CTT CAG AGA GAT ACA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTT GGT CCT TAG CCA CTC CTT C-3\u2032 ) , Ifng ( 5\u2032-ATG AAC GCT ACA CAC TGC ATC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCA TCC TTT TGC CAG TTC CTC-3\u2032 ) and iNos ( Nos2 ) ( 5\u2032-GTT CTC AGC CCA ACA ATA CAA GA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GTG GAC GGG TCG ATG TCA C-3\u2032 ) .

The 'Stroop task' is a classic demonstration of this process . In this task , individuals are shown words where the color and the meaning of the text conflict \u2013 for example , the word 'green' is written in blue . When asked what the color of the text is , individuals must suppress the instinct to read the word . This causes them to make more mistakes and take longer to decide on an answer than when they perform the same task using words that have no conflict ( for example , when \u201cred\u201d is written in red ) . Previous work has suggested that several regions within part of the brain called the frontal cortex play a role in this cognitive control process . However , the relative contributions of each of these regions , and the order in which they are activated , remain unclear . This is in part due to the fact that accurately measuring the electrical activity of the frontal cortex requires implanting electrodes into the brain . Tang et al . took advantage of a rare opportunity to record this activity from a group of patients who had electrodes implanted in their frontal cortex to treat epilepsy . The electrical signals recorded by these electrodes as the subjects performed the Stroop task revealed that four regions in the frontal cortex altered their activity during trials where the color and the meaning of a word conflicted . These responses corresponded with the subject\u2019s reaction time , changed depending on the exact nature of the task , and even reflected the subjects\u2019 errors . These responses arose at different times in different regions , allowing Tang et al . to suggest how signals flow through the frontal cortex during cognitive control . In the future it will be important to further understand how the regions of the frontal cortex identified by Tang et al . interact with each other and to establish their roles in cognitive control . These observations could then be used to produce a theoretical framework that describes how the brain adapts behavior to different circumstances .", "source": "Rapid and flexible interpretation of conflicting sensory inputs in the context of current goals is a critical component of cognitive control that is orchestrated by frontal cortex . The relative roles of distinct subregions within frontal cortex are poorly understood . To examine the dynamics underlying cognitive control across frontal regions , we took advantage of the spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in epilepsy patients while subjects resolved color-word conflict . We observed differential activity preceding the behavioral responses to conflict trials throughout frontal cortex; this activity was correlated with behavioral reaction times . These signals emerged first in anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) before dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) , followed by medial frontal cortex ( mFC ) and then by orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) . These results disassociate the frontal subregions based on their dynamics , and suggest a temporal hierarchy for cognitive control in human cortex . \n Flexible control of cognitive processes is fundamental to daily activities , including the execution of goal-directed tasks according to stimulus inputs and context dependencies . An important case of cognitive control arises when input stimuli elicit conflicting responses and subjects must select the task-relevant response despite competition from an often stronger but task-irrelevant response ( Miller , 2000; Miller and Cohen , 2001 ) . A canonical example of this type of conflict is the Stroop task: subjects are asked to name the font color of a word where the semantic meaning conflicts with the color signal ( e . g . the word 'red' shown in green versus red ) . Such incongruent inputs lead to longer reaction times , attributed to weaker signals ( color processing ) that must be emphasized over the automatic processing of word information ( Stroop , 1935 ) . The Stroop task is frequently used in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology and forms the foundation for theories of cognitive control . Neurophysiological , neuroimaging , and lesion studies have ascribed a critical role in cognitive control to networks within frontal cortex ( Miller , 2000; Miller and Cohen , 2001 ) , yet the neural circuit dynamics and mechanisms responsible for orchestrating control processes remain poorly understood . Lesion studies ( Cohen and Servan-Schreiber , 1992; Perrett , 1974 ) , human neuroimaging measurements ( Egner and Hirsch , 2005a; MacDonald , 2000 ) , and macaque single unit recordings ( Johnston et al . , 2007 ) implicate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) in providing top-down signals to bias processing in favor of the task-relevant stimuli ( Botvinick et al . , 2001; Miller and Cohen , 2001 ) . The medial frontal cortex ( mFC ) also participates in cognitive control , possibly in a conflict monitoring capacity ( Botvinick et al . , 2001; Ridderinkhof et al . , 2004; Rushworth et al . , 2004 ) . Recordings and lesions studies in the macaque anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) ( Ito et al . , 2003; Nakamura et al . , 2005 ) suggest that ACC neurons are principally involved in monitoring for errors and making between-trial adjustments ( Brown and Braver , 2005; Ito et al . , 2003; Johnston et al . , 2007; Roth\u00e9 et al . , 2011 ) \u2014an idea that has received support by a recent study in the human ACC ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . Recent work has also demonstrated that the supplementary motor area and the medial frontal cortex play an important role in monitoring for errors ( Bonini et al . , 2014 ) . An alternative and influential theoretical framework posits that the ACC monitors for potential conflicts and subsequently directs the dlPFC to engage control processes ( Botvinick et al . , 2001; Shenhav et al . , 2013 ) . Several human neuroimaging studies are consistent with this notion ( Botvinick et al . , 1999; Kerns , 2006; Kerns et al . , 2004; MacDonald , 2000 ) but the relative contributions of dlPFC , mFC , and ACC to cognitive control remain a matter of debate ( Aarts et al . , 2008; Cole et al . , 2009; Fellows and Farah , 2005; Mansouri et al . , 2007; Milham and Banich , 2005; Milham et al . , 2003; Rushworth et al . , 2004 ) . Previously , some neuroimaging studies have suggested that these frontal cortex regions can be differentiated based on the presence or absence of conflict signals ( MacDonald , 2000 ) . The challenge in dissociating the relative roles of these regions during Stroop-like tasks is that increased task difficulty recruits a host of executive functions ( attention , decision-making , uncertainty , cognitive control ) . These functions are associated with neural activity spanning tens to hundreds of milliseconds and the underlying dynamics are difficult to untangle with the low temporal resolution of existing neuroimaging techniques ( Shenhav et al . , 2013 ) . Human single neuron studies provide millisecond resolution but have focused on individual regions ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . We took advantage of the high spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in human epilepsy patients and the ability to record simultaneously from multiple regions to directly investigate the dynamics of conflict responses during cognitive control . We hypothesized that subregions of frontal cortex could be differentiated based on the temporal profile of their conflict responses . We recorded intracranial field potentials from 1397 electrodes in 15 subjects while they performed the Stroop task or a variation in which they were asked to read the word instead of focusing on its color . We observed conflict-selective activity throughout several regions in frontal cortex: ACC , mFC , dlPFC , and also orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) . Several analyses link these signals to cognitive control . Neural responses increased for incongruent compared to congruent trials , and these signals correlated with behavioral reaction time , depended on the task , and exhibited adaptation over trials . We compared pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes to disassociate these different regions based on the timing of these conflict responses rather than their presence or absence . Conflict responses emerged first in the ACC and subsequently emerged in dlPFC and mFC and finally in OFC . These observations propose a plausible flow of signals underlying cognitive control . \n We focused on 469 electrodes located in areas within frontal lobe which have been previously implicated in executive function: medial frontal cortex ( mFC , n = 111 ) , orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC , n = 156 ) , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC , n = 168 ) and the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC , n = 34 ) . We applied a non-parametric analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) to measure whether and when the physiological responses differed between congruent and incongruent trials . An electrode was considered conflict-selective if the F-statistic was greater than a significance threshold computed by a permutation test with P = 0 . 001 for 50 consecutive milliseconds ( Materials and methods ) . The latency was defined as the first time of this threshold-crossing . Figure 2 shows an example electrode from the left Anterior Cingulate Cortex that responded differentially between congruent and incongruent trials during the Stroop task . These signals were better aligned to the speech onset than to the stimulus onset , as shown in the response-aligned view ( compare Figure 2A\u2013C with Figure 2D\u2013F ) . During the Stroop task , the response-aligned signals were significantly stronger for the incongruent ( brown ) trials compared to the congruent ( black ) trials ( Figure 2D , P < 10\u20135 , ANOVA ) , and were invariant to the particular word/color combinations ( Figure 2G ) . Incongruent trials could be discriminated from congruent trials at a latency of 669 \u00b1 31 ms ( mean \u00b1 s . e . m . ) before the onset of the response ( Figure 2D ) . This conflict response was also specific to the Stroop task; there was a significant interaction between congruency and task ( F = 13 . 5 , P = 0 . 007 , ANOVA ) . The same stimuli did not elicit differential activity during the Reading task ( Figure 2F ) . We assessed the correlation between the neural signal strength and behavioral reaction times in single trials . The maximal gamma power during each incongruent trial ( using the average gamma power yielded similar results ) was positively correlated with the behavioral reaction times ( Figure 2H , \u03c1 = 0 . 25 , P = 0 . 02 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 006Figure 2 . Example electrode in left Anterior Cingulate Cortex . ( A ) Average gamma power signals aligned to the stimulus onset from an electrode during the Stroop task , for congruent ( black ) or incongruent ( brown ) stimuli . For display purposes only , we z-scored the gamma power by subtracting the average and dividing by the standard deviation of power during the baseline period ( 500 ms prior to stimulus onset ) . Shaded areas indicate s . e . m . The total number of trials for each condition is indicated in the upper right . ( B ) Single-trial data for congruent ( left ) and incongruent ( right ) trials .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 009 Any differences between congruent and incongruent trials in the stimulus-aligned analyses can be confounded by the reaction time differences; therefore , we focus subsequent analyses on the response-aligned signals . More example electrodes are shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ( dlPFC ) and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ( OFC ) . Using the aforementioned criteria , we identified n = 51 conflict selective frontal cortex electrodes during the Stroop task , with contributions from 13 subjects ( Supplementary files 2 and 3 ) . These electrodes were distributed throughout different subregions within frontal cortex ( Figure 3A ) . To evaluate whether random variation in the signals could give rise to apparent conflict-selective electrodes , we randomly shuffled the congruent/incongruent trial labels 10 , 000 times and applied the same statistical criteria ( Materials and methods ) . Across our population , we found n = 4 . 4 \u00b1 0 . 03 false positive electrodes ( mean \u00b1 s . e . m . , out of 469 electrodes ) , which corresponds to a false discovery rate ( FDR ) of q = 0 . 01 , which is significantly less than our observation of n = 51 electrodes . The number of conflict-selective electrodes within each subregion was significantly greater than expected by chance ( Figure 3B , P < 0 . 01 , all regions ) . We repeated the analyses during the Reading task . In contrast with the Stroop task , we only observed n = 3 conflict-selective frontal cortex electrodes during the Reading task ( out of 469 electrodes ) , a number that is within the false positive rate . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 010Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 011 To account for within-subject and across-subject variation , we used a multilevel model ( Aarts et al . , 2014 ) to conduct a group analysis of the physiological responses , with electrodes nested within subjects ( Materials and methods ) . Across the population , we observed a significant interaction between the factors congruency and task on the gamma power ( \u03c72=9 . 2 , P = 0 . 002 ) . Consistent with the single electrode examples , gamma power was greater for incongruent compared to congruent trials , but only during the Stroop task ( Figure 4A , Stroop: P < 10\u20133 , Reading: P = 0 . 56 ) . We computed the average response in each region ( Figure 4B ) . Each electrode\u2019s response was normalized by dividing the power during incongruent trials by the power in congruent trials ( dividing the brown curve by the black curve in Figure 2 ) , computing the logarithm and finally pooling within each region . The pooled responses in the OFC are visually less compelling ( Figure 4B , bottom right subplot ) due to the heterogeneity in the latency of the individual electrodes but the responses in the OFC were as vigorous as the ones in other areas ( e . g . Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Similar conclusions were reached when plotting the pooled responses aligned to stimulus onset ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 012Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 016 Several lines of evidence demonstrate a link between the neural signals described in the previous section and cognitive control: the neural signals correlated with reaction times , showed behavioral adaptation , and demonstrated error monitoring . As shown in previous studies , there was a wide distribution of behavioral reaction times ( Figure 1B ) . Consistent with the example electrode in Figure 2 , behavioral reaction times across the population correlated with the strength of the physiological signals , even after controlling for trial history ( Figure 4C , P < 10\u20135 , sign-rank test ) . The strength of these neural signals also revealed a neural correlate of the behavioral Gratton effect documented in Figure 1D: gamma power was greater in cI compared to iI trials ( Figure 4D ) . Using the aforementioned multilevel model , we found a significant interaction between trial history ( cI or iI ) and task ( \u03c72=4 . 4 , P = 0 . 03 ) . This Gratton effect was stronger in the Stroop task ( P < 0 . 001 ) than in the Reading task ( P = 0 . 72 ) . These differences were not observed for cC versus iC trials , where the interaction was not significant ( \u03c72=1 . 9 , P = 0 . 17 ) ( Figure 4E ) . This analysis was performed after removing stimulus repetition trials . The Gratton effect was present in all four frontal regions and there were no statistically significant differences in the strength of the effect across regions ( F = 0 . 25 , P\u00a0=\u00a00 . 86 , ANOVA ) . To control for reaction time effects on these comparisons , we ran an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) to test for a main effect of trial history on the gamma power with the behavioral reaction time as a covariate ( Materials and methods ) . The neural Gratton effect during the Stroop task persisted under these controlled conditions ( P = 0 . 0002 , multilevel model ) . We also explicitly ruled out reaction time differences by subsampling to match the reaction time distribution between conditions , with similar results ( P = 0 . 01 , multilevel model ) . Together , these results suggest that the neural signals described here code for an internally perceived level of conflict that exhibits conflict adaptation and correlates with the across-trial variability in reaction times . The results presented above focus on the neural signals filtered within the gamma frequency band ( 70\u2013120\u2009Hz ) . We also examined the responses elicited in the broadband signals ( 1 to 100\u2009Hz ) as well as in the theta , ( 4 to 8\u2009Hz ) , beta , ( 9 to 30\u2009Hz ) , and low gamma ( 30\u201370\u2009Hz ) bands . No conflict selective responses were observed in the broadband signals or low gamma band . We found conflict-selective responses both in the theta and beta bands ( see example in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2a\u2013f ) . Across theta and beta frequency bands , we also observed a significant interaction between Congruency and Task ( theta: P < 10\u20135 , beta: P < 10\u20134 , multilevel model ) . Consistent with the results reported in the gamma frequency band , conflict responses in the theta and beta bands were more prominent during the Stroop task compared to the Reading task ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . In contrast to the results in the gamma band , power in the theta and beta bands decreased during incongruent trials . Furthermore , power in the theta and beta frequency bands was not correlated with reaction times ( theta: P = 0 . 43 , beta: P = 0 . 09 , sign-rank test ) . In addition to separately examining the responses in different frequency bands , an important aspect of encoding of cognitive information is the relationship between signals across frequencies . In particular , several studies have demonstrated that the amplitude of the gamma band is coupled to the phase of slower oscillations in the theta band ( Canolty et al . , 2006; Oehrn et al . , 2014; Tort et al . , 2008 ) . We therefore examined the degree of cross-frequency coupling between the signals in the gamma and theta bands ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Consistent with previous studies , we found that 50% of the electrodes demonstrated significant theta-gamma coupling . However , the strength of this coupling was not different between congruent and incongruent trials across the population of conflict-selective electrodes ( P = 0 . 52 , sign-rank test ) . The conflict responses reported above are based on correct trials only . Yet , error monitoring has also been ascribed to frontal cortical circuits ( Bonini et al . , 2014; Shenhav et al . , 2013; Yeung et al . , 2004 ) . To investigate whether the same electrodes responding to conflict are also involved in successful error monitoring , we analyzed the neural signals during self-corrected trials . In these trials , subjects initially made an erroneous response and rapidly corrected themselves with the right answer . Given the high performance level of all subjects , the number of such trials is low . However , these trials are particularly interesting because we can be certain that there was successful error detection ( as opposed to error trials without any self-correction ) . An example self-corrected trial from the ACC electrode shown previously is illustrated in Figure 5A . The subject initially made an incorrect response ( green ) , which was rapidly followed with the correct response ( red ) . Increased gamma power was observed after onset of the erroneous response . In contrast , the following corrected behavioral response exhibited no such post-response signal . Additionally , these error-monitoring signals were not observed in correct incongruent trials ( Figure 2D ) , and were consistent across the n =\u00a011 self-corrected trials for this subject ( Figure 5B , P = 0 . 001 , signed rank test ) . Another example electrode is shown in Figure 5C\u2013D . There were only two subjects contributing n = 7 conflict-signaling electrodes that had a sufficient number of self-correction trials ( greater than five trials ) for this analysis . For each electrode , we compared the difference in neural signals during the one-second post-response window between the initial error and the following self-correction . Of those n = 7 electrodes , n = 5 electrodes showed evidence of error monitoring ( Figure 5E , P < 0 . 05 , sign-rank test ) . Although the number of electrodes and trials in this analysis is small , these results provide a direct correlate of error monitoring signals . Furthermore , these results highlight that the same electrodes that respond to conflict leading up to the behavioral response can also show post-response error monitoring . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 017Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 018 We observed conflict-selective responses in the anterior cingulate cortex , medial frontal cortex , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex . To examine the dynamics of cognitive control orchestrating the transformation of conflicting visual signals to motor outputs , we compared , across those four regional groups , the latencies relative to behavioral response onset at which the congruent and incongruent trials could be discriminated . Comparing latencies across regions is difficult , especially across subjects with varying reaction times . For a controlled and direct comparison , we restricted the analysis to compute the latency differences between pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes . This within-subject pairwise analysis had increased power to examine the relative dynamics between frontal lobe areas ( Figure 6 ) . The relative latencies were significantly different across the regions ( P = 0 . 01 , permutation test , post-hoc testing was controlled for multiple comparisons using the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure , Materials and methods ) . Conflict responses in the ACC preceded those in all the other frontal lobe regions , followed 207 \u00b1 40 ms later by dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and 388 \u00b1 83 ms later by medial frontal cortex . Signals in orbitofrontal cortex emerged 319 \u00b1 78 ms after dlPFC . This entire processing cascade took approximately 500 ms . For comparison , subjects\u2019 behavioral reaction times to incongruent trials were 1105 \u00b1 49 ms . The latency difference between ACC and dlPFC is based on 6 electrode pairs: one ACC electrode and six simultaneously recorded dlPFC electrodes . There was only one pair of simultaneous recordings between ACC and OFC and we do not report this value in Figure 6 . The other region comparisons have contributions from multiple electrodes in multiple subjects ( Supplementary file 3 ) . These results suggest a temporal hierarchy of cognitive control mechanisms culminating in speech onset . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 019Figure 6 . Latency Comparisons across regions . Latency differences between different regions computed from all pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes . np denotes the number of electrode pairs . Because we only consider simultaneously recorded electrodes here , not all the electrodes modulated by conflict can be paired with any other electrode . Supplementary file 3 shows the number of electrodes modulated by conflict in each area and subject . There was only one electrode pair between ACC and OFC and therefore we do not show the latency difference between these two regions here . Significant latency differences ( P < 0 . 05 , permutation test , Materials and methods ) are shown in black , and non-significant differences in gray . ACC leads both mFC ( P = 0 . 001 ) and dlPFC ( P = 0 . 02 ) , with OFC following dlPFC ( P = 0 . 009 ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 020 \n We used intracranial field potentials to measure the dynamics of conflict responses across frontal cortex leading up to the behavioral response in the Stroop task . Previous physiological and functional neuroimaging studies have documented the involvement of multiple of these frontal cortex areas in the Stroop or similar tasks ( Botvinick et al . , 1999; Kolling et al . , 2012; MacDonald , 2000; Niendam et al . , 2012; Oehrn et al . , 2014; Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . The intracranial field potential recordings reported here show conflict-selective signals in ACC ( e . g . Figure 2 ) , dlPFC ( e . g . Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , mFC ( e . g . Figure 4B ) and OFC ( e . g . Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The mFC and dlPFC have been previously implicated in cognitive control , and these structures are extensively connected to the rest of frontal cortex areas ( Ridderinkhof et al . , 2004 ) . The role of the OFC in cognitive control during Stroop-like tasks has not been reported previously , possibly because of technical challenges in neuroimaging near this area ( Weiskopf et al . , 2006 ) . We presented several lines of evidence that demonstrate that these conflict-selective physiological signals are relevant for behavior during the Stroop task . Longer behavioral reaction times were correlated with greater gamma power on a trial-by-trial basis during the Stroop task but not during the Reading task , even after accounting for trial history and for differences between congruent and incongruent stimuli ( Figure 2H , 4C ) . The same identical stimuli can elicit a range of behavioral reaction times and this internal degree of conflict can be captured , at least partly , by the strength of gamma power in frontal cortex in each trial . The neural correlates of behavioral adaptation ( Gratton effect\u00a0[Gratton et al . , 1992] ) were observed in the ACC , consistent with prior studies based on human single neuron recordings ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) , neuroimaging ( Botvinick et al . , 1999; Kerns , 2006 ) and also in accordance with the behavioral effects of ACC resection ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . Conflict responses throughout the other frontal cortex regions also demonstrated the neural Gratton effect , suggesting a more distributed network involved in across-trial adaptation than previously hypothesized . The physiological responses in these areas were stronger in cI trials ( incongruent trials that were preceded by congruent trials ) than iI trials ( Figure 4D ) . While the increased activity in cI trials compared to iI trials is consistent with neuroimaging studies ( Botvinick et al . , 1999 ) , single neuron recordings in a different Stroop-like task report the opposite relationship ( iI > cI ) ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . These differences point to potentially interesting distinctions between the activity of individual neurons and coarser population measures that warrant further investigation . Another discrepancy between neuroimaging studies and single unit recordings is the presence of conflict responses and error signals . Single unit recording in macaque ACC typically find error monitoring signals but not conflict-selective responses ( Cole et al . , 2009; Emeric et al . , 2010; Ito et al . , 2003; Taylor et al . , 2006 ) , see however ( Ebitz and Platt , 2015 ) , whereas human neuroimaging studies report both types of signals in ACC . There has been significant debate concerning whether action monitoring and conflict detection represent distinct processes ( Carter et al . , 1998; Carter et al . , 2000; Nee et al . , 2011; Swick and Turken , 2002 ) . Because both processes may co-occur on the same trials , high temporal resolution is required to disassociate the two computations . A recent human intracranial study has found error signals in supplementary motor area and medial frontal cortex ( Bonini et al . , 2014 ) , and a human single unit study reported conflict signals in ACC ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . The current work demonstrates the coexistence of both error signals and conflict signals . The analysis of the few self-correction trials in our data suggests that the same areas responsible for pre-behavioral conflict signals can also produce post-behavioral response error-monitoring signals ( Figure 5 ) . In addition , the relative timing of the conflict and error signals surrounding the neural responses confirms computational predictions based on a connectionist architecture to explain the mechanisms of conflict ( Yeung et al . , 2004 ) and scalp EEG studies ( Hughes and Yeung , 2011 ) . These results are consistent with computational models suggesting that these signals may represent a general error-likelihood prediction , of which conflict and error detection are special cases ( Brown and Braver , 2005 ) . It has been suggested that ACC and supplementary eye field neurons in macaque monkeys respond to specific stimulus and/or behavioral combinations but are not directly modulated by conflict ( Cole et al . , 2009; Nakamura et al . , 2005 ) . At the level of the intracranial field potentials reported here , the modulation of conflict trials observed in the four frontal cortex regions could not be ascribed to specific stimulus or behavioral responses ( e . g . Figure 2G ) and were also task dependent ( compare Figure 2A versus 2C ) . In these patients , we did not have access to single neuron responses and we therefore cannot rule out the possibility that individual neurons show distinct patterns of responses that are averaged out at the field potential level . Besides the high gamma band , we also observed conflict responses in the beta and theta bands , but not the low gamma band ( e . g . Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Previous work has suggested differential roles for distinct oscillatory components of the local field potential ( Cavanagh and Frank , 2014; Kahana et al . , 2001; Ullsperger et al . , 2014; von Stein and Sarnthein , 2000 ) . There were clear differences in the type of information conveyed by distinct frequencies components . Lack of significant correlations with reaction time in the theta and beta bands suggests that the gamma band better captures the behavior . Additionally , conflict responses were characterized by increased power in the gamma band , but decreased power in the theta and beta bands ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Previous scalp EEG recordings ( Cavanagh and Frank , 2014; Ullsperger et al . , 2014; van Driel et al . , 2015 ) have demonstrated that conflict and/or error trials elicit increased theta power , suggesting potentially interesting differences in how theta is captured across spatial scales . We also observed a decrease in beta power , which is consistent with previous studies that correlate frontal cortex activation with desynchronization in the beta band and increased synchronization in the gamma bands ( Crone et al . , 1998a; Crone et al . , 1998b ) . Differences across tasks , recording methods , and targeted regions should be interpreted with caution . The roles of different oscillatory components in neocortex are not clearly understood . One possibility is that lower frequency bands reflect the summed dendritic input of the nearby neural population ( Logothetis et al . , 2001; Mitzdorf , 1987 ) and can act as channels for communication ( Cavanagh and Frank , 2014 ) , whereas higher frequency bands represent the population spiking rate ( Buzsaki et al . , 2012; Ray and Maunsell , 2011 ) . Along these lines , we speculate that the theta desynchronization we observe could reflect a reduction of inputs , leading to inhibition of the prepotent but erroneous response . While we observed conflict responses throughout frontal cortex , the spatiotemporal resolution of our intracranial recordings allowed us to separate regions by the latency at which conflict-selective responses emerge with respect to speech onset . By comparing pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes , we found that conflict responses in the ACC lead the dlPFC by ~200 ms . Medial frontal cortex is anatomically close and extensively connected to the ACC , and the two regions are often grouped together ( Cavanagh et al . , 2009; Ridderinkhof et al . , 2004 ) . Yet , conflict responses in the mFC trail the ACC by hundreds of milliseconds , suggesting an important distinction between the two regions ( Rushworth et al . , 2004 ) . The relative latency measurements place the OFC at the bottom of this cascade . The hierarchical cascade of processes described here is consistent with predictions from mechanistic models of cognitive control ( e . g . see Figure 2 in Shenhav et al , Neuron 2013 ) . In particular , stimulus related signals are evident along the ventral visual stream early on and feed onto frontal cortex , where we find that ACC activity precedes activity in other frontal regions , followed by dlPFC , and finally mFC , and OFC . Since the local field potential pools over many neurons , latency measures can be influenced by a variety of factors , such as the proportion of neurons selective for conflict and their laminar organization . Yet , at least in the ACC , the temporal profile of conflict responses we observed is similar to responses from human single unit recordings ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . The relatively long delays between regions are also particularly intriguing . There are monosynaptic connections that link these four regions within frontal cortex and yet , it takes 100\u2013200 ms to detect the relative activation between these areas ( Figure 6 ) . Daily decisions require integration of different goals , contexts , input signals , and the consequences of the resulting actions . The current study provides initial steps to elucidate not only which brain areas participate in cognitive control on a trial-by-trial basis but also their relative interactions and differential roles . The relative latency measurements and correlations between neural activity and reaction time provide a framework to constrain theories of cognitive control , and propose a plausible flow of conflict responses through frontal cortex . \n Subjects were 15 patients ( 10 male , Ages 10\u201350 , Supplementary file 1 ) with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy treated at Children\u2019s Hospital Boston ( CHB ) , Johns Hopkins Medical Institution ( JHMI ) , Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital ( BWH ) , or Taipei Veterans General Hospital ( TVGH ) . These subjects were implanted with intracranial electrodes in frontal cortex for clinical purposes . Five other subjects participated in this task but they were excluded from the analyses because they did not have any electrodes in frontal cortex . All studies were approved by each hospital\u2019s institutional review boards and were carried out with the subjects\u2019 informed consent . Subjects were implanted with 2\u00a0mm diameter intracranial subdural electrodes ( Ad-Tech , Racine , WI , USA ) that were arranged into grids or strips with 1 cm separation . Electrode locations were determined by clinical considerations . There were 1397 electrodes ( 15 subjects ) . Sampling rates ranged from 256\u2009Hz to 1000\u2009Hz depending on the equipment at each institution: CHB ( XLTEK , Oakville , ON , Canada ) , BWH ( Bio-Logic , Knoxville , TN , USA ) , JHMI ( Nihon Kohden , Tokyo , Japan ) , and TVGH ( Natus , San Carlos , CA ) . All the data were collected during periods without any seizure events or immediately\u00a0following any seizures . A schematic of the task is shown in Figure 1 . After 500 ms of fixation , subjects were presented with a word stimulus for 2 s . The stimulus presentation was 3 s in two subjects . Stimuli were one of three words ( Red , Blue , Green ) presented in the subjects\u2019 primary language ( CHB , BWH , JHMI: English; TVGH: Mandarin ) either in red , blue , or green font color . Stimuli subtended approximately 5 degrees of visual angle and were centered on the screen . Trials were either congruent ( C ) , where the font color matched the word , or incongruent ( I ) , where the font color conflicted with the word . The order of congruent and incongruent trials was randomized . Approximately 40% of the trials were incongruent trials . Within congruent trials and within incongruent trials all color-word combinations were counter balanced and randomly interleaved . Subjects were asked to either name the color ( Stroop task ) or read the word ( Reading task ) within the time limit imposed by the stimulus presentation time . Each block contained 18 trials , and the two tasks were completed in separate blocks . Most subjects completed 18 blocks of the Stroop task and 9 blocks of the Reading task ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Audio was recorded using a microphone at 8192\u2009Hz sampling rate . No correct/incorrect feedback was provided . Electrodes were localized by co-registering the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) with the postoperative computer tomography ( CT ) ( Destrieux et al . , 2010; Liu et al . , 2009 ) . In 4 subjects without a postoperative CT , electrodes were localized using intraoperative photographs and preoperative MRI . For each subject , the brain surface was reconstructed from the MRI and then assigned to one of 75 regions by Freesurfer . Depth electrodes were assigned to either a subcortical structure or to gyri/sulci . We focused on those electrodes in four frontal cortex regions ( ACC: anterior and middle-anterior cingulate gyrus , mFC: superior frontal gyrus , dlPFC: middle frontal gyrus , and OFC: orbitofrontal gyrus ) . To determine the behavioral reaction time for each trial , the short-time energy was computed from the audio recordings . For an audio signal x ( t ) , the short-time energy E ( t ) is defined as: E ( t ) =\u2211m=0m=T[x ( m ) w ( t\u2212m ) ]2 , where T is the length of the recording and w ( t ) is a 300-point Hamming window ( ~40 ms ) . Speech onset was defined as the first time when the energy crossed a threshold set as 1 standard deviation above the baseline . Only trials where the subject gave a single verbal response and the speech onset could be identified were considered correct trials . Unless otherwise noted , analyses in this manuscript used correct trials only . Electrodes with significant spectral noise were excluded from analysis ( n = 25 out of 1397 total electrodes ) . For each electrode , a notch filter was applied at 60\u2009Hz , and the common average reference computed from all channels was subtracted . Power in the theta ( 4\u20138\u2009Hz ) , beta ( 9\u201330\u2009Hz ) , and high-gamma band ( 70\u2013120\u2009Hz ) was extracted using a moving window multi-taper Fourier transform ( Chronux toolbox [Mitra and Bokil , 2008] ) with a time-bandwidth product of five and seven tapers . The window size was 200 ms with 10 ms increments . In several figures , the gamma power was z-scored for display purposes ( see figure legends ) . To determine whether and when an electrode responded selectively to conflict , we used a sliding F-statistic procedure ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Electrodes with differential responses between congruent and incongruent trials were selected by computing the F-statistic , for each time bin , comparing the neural responses between congruent and incongruent trials . Electrodes were denoted as \u2018conflict selective\u2019 if ( 1 ) the F-statistic exceeded a significance threshold for 50 consecutive milliseconds , and ( 2 ) the average neural response exceeded one standard deviation above the baseline period at least once during the trial . A null distribution generated by randomly permuting the labels was used to set the significance threshold with P\u00a0=\u00a00 . 001 . The latency at which congruent and incongruent stimuli could be discriminated was defined as the first time of this threshold crossing . For the response-aligned view , only electrodes where the latency preceded the response were included in subsequent analysis . This selection process was independently performed for each electrode in both stimulus-aligned and response-aligned analyses , and separately for the Stroop and Reading task . We used a permutation test with 10 , 000 shuffles to obtain a false discovery rate for our selection process . The congruent/incongruent trial labels were randomized 10 , 000 times and we measured the average number of electrodes across our population that passed the selection procedure . For the selected electrodes obtained with the procedure described in the previous section , we performed a number of within-electrode analyses . We measured single-trial correlations with behavioral reaction times , assessed the significance of interactions and simple/main effects , and controlled for confounds in measuring the neural Gratton effect . To account for both within-subject and across-subject variance , statistical testing of the electrophysiological data was conducted with multilevel models ( Aarts et al . , 2014; Goldstein , 2011 ) ( also known as random effect models ) . Random factors included electrodes nested within subjects . Significance of interactions and/or main effects was assessed with a likelihood ratio test against a null model excluding that particular term . For comparison of latency across regions , we restricted our analyses to simultaneous measurements made within each subject . We computed the latency difference for each pair of simultaneously recorded electrodes from different regions . The F-statistic of this latency difference across the groups was compared against a null distribution generated by shuffling , within each subject , the region labels ( n = 10 , 000 shuffles ) . Post hoc testing used the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure to control for multiple comparisons . To measure cross-frequency coupling between the theta and gamma frequency bands , we used the Modulation Index ( MI ) defined previously ( Tort et al . , 2008 ) . Activity in the theta ( 4\u20138\u2009Hz ) and high gamma ( 70\u2013120\u2009Hz ) bands was obtained with a zero-phase least-squares finite impulse response ( FIR ) filter . Instantaneous phase and amplitude was extracted with the Hilbert Transform . For the Stroop and Reading Task separately , the MI was computed as the Kullback-Leiber distance between the phase-amplitude histogram and a uniform distribution . For comparison between tasks , the number of trials was equalized . This MI was compared against a surrogate distribution generated by randomly lagging the time series across 1000 repetitions . Similar results were obtained with the measure defined in Canolty et al . ( Canolty et al . , 2006 ) . Results were also similar when a surrogate distribution was created by randomly pairing low-frequency phase with high-frequency power from different trials . To compare the strength of cross-frequency coupling between congruent and incongruent conditions , we computed the difference in MI between the two conditions while equalizing the trial count . This difference was compared against a null distribution generated by randomly shuffling the congruent and incongruent labels ."}

The myosins are a family of motor proteins that pull cargo along filaments made of another protein called actin . The \u2018head\u2019 end of myosin attaches to the actin filament and the \u2018tail\u2019 end binds to the cargo . The head and tail are connected by a flexible linker that allows the protein to change shape . The tails of two myosin molecules bind together to form a two-headed motor that can move along an actin filament by taking 74 nm steps . At the start of each step , both heads are attached to the actin with one in front of the other . The leading head remains attached while the rear head detaches from actin and moves in front of the leading head reattaching to actin . These movements are repeated many times to allow the motor to move along the filament , much like a tightrope walker walking along a wire . However , it is not known how the motor can move so efficiently along the actin while managing to avoid falling off its track . Here , Andrecka et al . analyzed the movement of the myosin 5 motor in real time using a method called \u2018interferometric scattering microscopy\u2019 . The experiments show that when a head detaches from the actin , it is temporarily held out to one side of the actin filament . From here , this detached head sways back and forth , until it takes a step forward and binds firmly to the next position on the filament . Both heads follow identical paths along the actin filament , and so the movement resembles the way that a drawing or dividing compass can be used to measure distances on a map . Andrecka et al . 's findings shed new light on how myosin motors move along actin . This may become a blueprint for efficient nano-mechanical motion and could therefore be important for designing artificial machines that operate on the nanoscale .", "source": "Myosin 5a is a dual-headed molecular motor that transports cargo along actin filaments . By following the motion of individual heads with interferometric scattering microscopy at nm spatial and ms temporal precision we found that the detached head occupies a loosely fixed position to one side of actin from which it rebinds in a controlled manner while executing a step . Improving the spatial precision to the sub-nm regime provided evidence for an \u00e5ngstrom-level structural transition in the motor domain associated with the power stroke . Simultaneous tracking of both heads revealed that consecutive steps follow identical paths to the same side of actin in a compass-like spinning motion demonstrating a symmetrical walking pattern . These results visualize many of the critical unknown aspects of the stepping mechanism of myosin 5 including head\u2013head coordination , the origin of lever-arm motion and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the translocating head during individual steps . \n Myosin 5a moves in a hand-over-hand fashion with individual heads moving by 74 nm and the center of mass by 37 nm for each step ( Vale , 2003; Sellers and Veigel , 2006; Hammer and Sellers , 2012 ) . A finely tuned kinetic sequence of ATP binding , hydrolysis , phosphate release and eventually ADP release by the enzymatic heads enables processive motion towards the \u2018+\u2019 end of actin filaments ( De La Cruz et al . , 1999; De La Cruz and Ostap , 2004; Rosenfeld and Sweeney , 2004; Sakamoto et al . , 2008; Forgacs et al . , 2008 ) . One of the most remarkable aspects of myosin 5a is the efficient conversion of chemical energy by the molecular-sized enzymatic heads into a translation of 74 nm along a 7 nm diameter actin filament in the presence of Brownian motion and a crowded cellular environment . Crystal structures of myosin 5a exist either with or without nucleotide , but only in the detached state ( Coureux et al . , 2003 , 2004 ) . Although these structures served as a model for the structural changes potentially induced by binding to actin , ( Volkmann et al . , 2005 ) the internally coupled rearrangement of the subdomains leading to ADP and phosphate release or dissociation from actin upon ATP binding could only be studied in silico ( Cecchini et al . , 2008 , 2010; Sweeney and Houdusse , 2010; Preller and Holmes , 2013 ) . The experimental challenge in revealing such structural dynamics has been largely of spatiotemporal origin , since they are likely on the \u00c5ngstrom scale and may be very transient . Similarly , there has been considerable interest in directly revealing the motion of the individual heads as myosin steps along actin in an attempt to unravel the origins of efficient motion on the nanoscale . Single molecule studies employing optical trapping ( Mehta et al . , 1999; Rief et al . , 2000 ) and fluorescence imaging ( Forkey et al . , 2003; Yildiz et al . , 2003; Snyder et al . , 2004; Warshaw et al . , 2005 ) have either reported periods of increased flexibility , ( Veigel et al . , 2002; Dunn and Spudich , 2007; Beausang et al . , 2013 ) or partitioning of the step into sub-events ( Veigel et al . , 2002; Uemura et al . , 2004; Cappello et al . , 2007; Sellers and Veigel , 2010 ) . All resulting models involve a forward aiming power stroke followed by a Brownian search mechanism ( Veigel et al . , 2002; Okada et al . , 2007; Shiroguchi and Kinosita , 2007; Karagiannis et al . , 2014 ) . The power stroke of the attached head contributes only partially to the step by moving the pivot point that facilitates Brownian rotation of the unbound head . The bias towards the next binding site is believed to be provided by the recovery stroke and its stability , but how unidirectional stepping is achieved in the presence of such a large and mostly random motion remains unclear ( Shiroguchi et al . , 2011 ) . The first passage time of the translocating head is expected to be on the order of 100 \u00b5s , ( Veigel et al . , 2002; Hinczewski et al . , 2013 ) although the head spends tens of ms in the unbound state given the maximum rates of ATP hydrolysis and binding to actin ( Veigel et al . , 2002; Dunn and Spudich , 2007; Beausang et al . , 2013 ) . Any technique aiming to visualize the structural dynamics of the motor domain or the motion of the unattached head would thus have to achieve simultaneous millisecond temporal and nanometer spatial precision . Optical trapping operates in this spatiotemporal regime , but it is not possible to monitor the motion of the unattached head without significant perturbation . Smaller labels affixed to the myosin motor domain or to calmodulin molecules on the lever arm , as available in fluorescence imaging , do not suffer from this limitation , but cannot provide sufficient localization precision on the millisecond time scale . We therefore designed an assay based on interferometric scattering microscopy ( iSCAT ) , ( Kukura et al . , 2009; Ortega-Arroyo and Kukura , 2012 ) a technique that has recently been shown to enable simultaneous high-speed and high-precision imaging of 20 nm diameter or smaller nanoscale scattering labels ( Andrecka et al . , 2013; Ortega Arroyo et al . , 2014 ) . \n We attached a 20 nm gold label functioning as an efficient light scatterer to the N-terminus of the myosin 5 head and tracked its motion as the motor travels along actin filaments ( Figure 1A , inset ) . From the centre of mass of the signal produced by the label , we determined the position of the head as a function of time revealing discrete 74 nm steps at 1000 frames/s imaging speed with \u223c4 nm positional precision ( Figure 1A , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A , Video 1 ) . We verified that the addition of the 20 nm label did not interfere with the mechano\u2013chemical cycle of myosin 5a by characterizing the speed of movement at different ATP concentrations . Our results compare well with those from a series of other single molecule studies where the molecule was labeled on the lever arm , the tail , or attached to a surface ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 003Figure 1 .

This file contains the iSCAT video from which the trajectory shown in Figure 1 of the main manuscript was obtained . The left panel presents the raw video format after referencing with the flat field image . The flat field accounts for illumination inhomogeneities and was generated as described in the Materials and Methods section . The right panel shows the static background subtracted video format . The background includes the average of 100 frames before the particle binds and removes the constant features which are part of the sample ( a . g . actin , glass roughness ) by simple subtraction ( Ortega Arroyo et al . , 2014 ) . The video was taken at 1000 frames/s and at a magnification of 31 . 8 nm/pixel . The corresponding field of view shown is 1 . 30 \u00d7 1 . 30 \u03bcm2 and corresponds to a total recording time of 1 . 3 s . The video playback speed is 1000 frames/s . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 007 In addition to the expected 74 nm steps , we observed periods of increased positional fluctuations between detachment and reattachment of the labeled head , previously interpreted as a signature of Brownian search ( Dunn and Spudich , 2007 ) . Our effective lateral localization precision of 4 nm at 1000 frames/s , however , enabled us to visualize the motion of the unbound head precisely and revealed a transient state with a center of mass just over half way between the two binding sites and offset by 40 nm perpendicular to the actin filament ( Figure 1B ) . From this position , the myosin head repeatedly moved back and forth between the next actin binding site and the transient state position ( Figure 1C , D ) . The same behavior sometimes occurred just before myosin detached from the filament at the end of a trajectory ( Figure 1E ) , although detachment of myosin with the labeled head bound was equally likely . On the rare occasions that the labelled leading head of myosin detached and reattached , it occupied a similar position in space to a translocating head ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) , suggesting that the transient state represents a true potential minimum of the one head bound state of myosin . In addition to providing nanometer precise information on the lateral position of the head through the center of mass of the signal , the iSCAT signal magnitude is very sensitive to the label-to-surface distance allowing for overall nanometric localization in three-dimensions ( Krishnan et al . , 2010 ) . This property arises from the interferometric nature of the technique , which scales the iSCAT signal as sin\u03a6 , where \u03a6 is the phase difference between scattered and reflected light fields . As the label moves perpendicular to the sample plane , the optical path length and with it the phase difference between the two fields changes by the following relation \u03a6 = 4\u03c0\u03b7z/\u03bb ( Figure 2A , inset ) . A complete signal inversion occurs for a displacement of z = \u03bb/4\u03b7 = 84 nm , where \u03bb is the illumination wavelength ( 445 nm ) and \u03b7 the refractive index of the medium ( 1 . 33 ) . Thus , variations in the axial distance of the motor domain with respect to the filament bound to the sample surface lead to changes in the scattering contrast . We often observed these changes in contrast between the actin bound and unbound states ( Figure 2A ) and obtained an average change in iSCAT signal during the step ( Figure 2B ) . The drop of 3 . 5% in iSCAT contrast ( \u223c40% of the total signal ) suggests that the myosin head lifts on average by 24 \u00b1 10 nm from its actin bound position . Although the precision of the measurement was in principle higher , we could not accurately determine the additional phase contributions to the interferometric signal on an individual label basis , which are required for a robust calibration . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 008Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 009 We occasionally encountered tracks where the transient state could not be localized because the iSCAT contrast dropped to zero . We interpret these cases as corresponding to molecules oriented parallel to the glass surface based on simultaneous iSCAT measurements using blue ( 445 nm ) and red ( 635 nm ) illumination . The particle remained visible in the red channel while it disappeared in the blue . At the same time , the off-axis component of the transient state was much smaller compared to those trajectories when the transient state remained visible in both channels , which is most consistent with a parallel bound molecule lifting the detached head up by \u223c40 nm ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . To investigate whether subsequent steps occur on the same or opposite sides of the actin filament , commonly referred to as symmetric and asymmetric hand-over-hand stepping , ( Hua et al . , 2002 ) we labeled the two heads of a single molecule differently , one with a quantum dot and the other with a 20 nm gold particle ( Figure 3 , top ) . Simultaneous detection of quantum dot fluorescence and iSCAT signal was only possible with a longer wavelength scattering beam which is only weakly absorbed by the quantum dot , thereby avoiding excessive blinking and bleaching ( 660 vs 445 nm ) . In addition , the imaging speed was lowered to 500 frames/s to ensure <10 nm localization precision in the fluorescence channel while imaging over several seconds . We tracked both the scattering from the gold particle of one head ( upper traces in Figure 3 ) and the fluorescence of the quantum dot-labeled head ( lower traces in Figure 3 ) . In all recorded trajectories of doubly-labeled molecules that exhibited clear transient states in both the fluorescence and scattering channels , the transient states for both heads appeared on the same side of the actin filament ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 010Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 011 Close inspection of the time traces occasionally revealed what appeared to be small backwards movements of the attached head , such as the transition starting at 480 ms in the trace of Figure 1A . Since our localisation precision at 1000 frames/s is limited by the intrinsic motion of the label about its attachment point to the motor domain and diffusion of background scatterers , we repeated the tracking assay at 100 frames/s . At this imaging speed , we could frequently observe a transition between two distinct states during each 74 nm step in both an x\u2013y projection ( Figure 4A ) and the time trace ( Figure 4B ) . As shown in the lateral trajectory , the transition between these states ( AB transition ) involves a small , <10 nm , off-axis backward motion of the gold particle attached to the bound head . As a result , the overall step size appears larger than the expected 74 nm step ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 012Figure 4 .

This file contains a full video from which the trajectory shown in Figure 4 of the main manuscript was obtained . The video was taken at 100 frames/s and at a magnification of 31 . 8 nm/pixel . The corresponding field of view shown is 2 \u00d7 2 \u03bcm2 and corresponds to a total recording time of 5 s . The video playback speed is 100 frames/s . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 014 The positional fluctuations ( \u03c3 = 0 . 91 nm SD ) of a surface-attached label recorded in the same field of view as the trajectory suggest that we achieved sub-nm lateral localization precision of 20 nm gold at 100 frames/s ( Figure 4B , blue ) . The localization noise increased for a gold bead attached to an actin-bound myosin ( \u03c3 = 1 . 6 \u00b1 0 . 3 nm in Figure 4B ) , but remained small enough such that transitions on the order of 5 nm were clearly visible ( Figure 4A\u2013B ) . The slightly larger positional fluctuations for gold bound to the actomyosin complex compared to immobilized gold were likely caused by a combination of a flexible protein-label connection and a limited ability in to completely immobilize actin . We observed a clear drop in the iSCAT contrast when the labeled trailing head detached and transitioned to the leading position ( Figure 4C ) . We also measured a much smaller change in iSCAT contrast during the AB transition , likely due to a three-dimensional reorientation of the label . We then performed simultaneous tracking of the head and the tail of myosin 5a , which showed that the small backwards transition corresponds to the power stroke of the bound motor domain . To achieve this , we labeled the myosin head with a 20 nm gold particle as previously and the tail with a GFP booster ( Ries et al . , 2012 ) . We reduced our frame rate to 20 frames/s in order to increase the fluorescence signal from the tail , since single molecule fluorescence tracking of GFP with <5 nm precision at 100 frames/s is challenging . The resulting traces showed that both the large-scale translocation of the head and the subsequent smaller backwards transition coincide with translation of the tail ( Figure 5A ) . This implies that the small-scale transition accompanies the power stroke of the attached labeled head ( AB transition ) and is representative of a pre- to post-power stroke transition ( Figure 5B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 015Figure 5 . Simultaneous iSCAT and fluorescence tracking of myosin 5a . ( A ) Tracking of the scattering signal from the gold nanoparticle attached to the N-terminus ( black ) and fluorescence signal from the GFP moiety located at the C-terminus of the same myosin 5a molecule ( green ) . Movement of the tail correlates with the labeled head taking its step ( 74 nm displacement ) and with the AB transition ( power stroke of the labeled head ) . Green arrows represent the tail movement , which corresponds to the step of either the labelled or unlabeled head . When the unlabeled head takes its step it coincides with the AB transition within the labeled head ( red arrows ) .

ATP concentration: 1 \u03bcM . Imaging speed for both channels: 20 frames/s . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 015 To determine the structural origin of the AB transition , we repeated the tracking experiments with differently sized labels . We found that the average size of the AB transition increased from 7 . 4 \u00b1 3 . 2 nm to 9 . 5 \u00b1 3 . 1 nm and 11 . 5 \u00b1 2 . 5 nm for 20 , 30 and 40 nm diameter labels , respectively ( Figure 6A ) . This suggests that the AB transition reports on a conformational change of the bound head , which is a rotation of the N-terminal domain , rather than a translation of the head itself along actin . The consequences of a rotational movement of the label are presented schematically in Figure 6B . The red circles indicate the positions of two labels in the pre-power stroke A state ( with radii r1 and r2 , where r2 = 2 \u00d7 r1 ) . The grey circles correspond to the post-power stroke B state . Red and grey dots indicate their respective centers . For a larger label ( r2 ) , the same movement of the N-terminus leads to an overall similar motion but with a larger displacement of the center of mass ( d2 ) than for a small label ( d1 ) . Using this model and our data , we could extract an angle of rotation , \u03b1 , as well as a distance , x , that defines the origin of rotation , since sin ( \u03b1/2 ) = \u00bd d1/ ( r1 + x ) and d2/d1 = ( r2 + x ) / ( r1 + x ) . Using the hydrodynamic radii for the labels obtained by dynamic light scattering ( 20 , 26 and 32 nm ) , we obtained \u03b1 = 20\u00b0 for the angle and x = 1 . 7 nm . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 016Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 016 Trajectories recorded at 100 frames/s frequently showed both the position of the transient state and the direction of the AB transition , revealing that they were invariably in line ( Figure 7A , B ) . During the recording of 351 traces that exhibited clear signatures of the transient state at 100 frames/s , we found a preference ( 66% vs 33% ) of right over left-handed walking . Within individual traces , we only observed the transient state on the same side of actin . In some cases , however , we could observe individual myosin molecules switch from one actin filament to another . As previously , the transient state always appeared on one side while on one actin filament , but either switched to the other ( Figure 7C ) or remained on the same side ( Figure 7D ) of the actin track when the molecule moved from one filament to another . For 102 switching events , we found that the transient state remained on the same side of the filament 60% of the time , while changing sides in 40% of the events . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 017Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 017 Given that the transient state could always be clearly identified either to the right or to the left side of actin , we could align all recorded steps from the 1000 frames/s tracking data by flipping them about the actin filament when necessary to obtain a 2D spatial probability distribution maps of the location of both the unbound and bound myosin head compared to the actin binding sites during a single step ( Figure 8 ) . The resulting contour plot contained two maxima . For the transient state one was located \u223c5 nm away from the final actin binding site and the other 40 nm off-axis from the actin filament . For the A and B states the bound head orientations were in line with the position of the transient state , with the lateral projection connecting the A , B and transient states approximately in a straight line ( see also Figure 7 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 018Figure 8 .

Spatiotemporal dynamics of the transient state as a function of ATP concentration . ( A ) Contour maps of the transient state at three different ATP concentrations .

Dwell time distributions for pre and post-power stroke states at different ATP concentrations . In all cases , data and fits for the pre-power stroke state are shown in red; data and fits for the post-power stroke state are shown in blue . At saturating ( 1 mM ) ATP concentration ( A ) both dwell time distributions exhibited single exponential behaviour in line with ADP release being the rate limiting step . The constants for the A state dwell times are given by kA and that for the B state by kB . At lower ATP concentrations , sequential ADP release and ATP binding result in bi-exponential behaviour . At 10 \u03bcM ATP ( B ) , both kinetic constants , k1 , k2 , are almost identical therefore the dwell time distribution is fit to two sequential process with the same rate constant ( termed kA for the dwell time of the A state and kB for that of the B state ) . ( C ) At 1 \u03bcM ATP the process is limited by ATP binding . Data taken at 100 frames/s , we increased the imaging speed to 400 Hz at 1 mM ATP concentration . Total number of steps recorded: 110 , 245 and 104 , for 1 \u03bcM , 10 \u03bcM and 1 mM , respectively .

Geometrical considerations assuming myosin molecules moving parallel to the glass surface . If the head searched the full spherical space , the average position would be simply about half way between the leading head and the next binding site . For a parallel orientation this would be 56 nm forward and 15 nm off axis and for a perpendicular orientation 56 nm forward but \u2018in line\u2019 with the bound head positions . These numbers arise from simple geometric considerations but also agree with much more sophisticated simulations based on a free rotational diffusion model ( Hinczewski et al . , 2013 ) . We , however , observed a transient state half way between the two binding sites , 40 nm off axis ( marked in orange ) , which rules out this geometry .

Contour map of a two-dimensional histogram with a 18 \u00d7 18 nm2 bin width was obtained using all , left- and right- handed walking traces , without flipping ( left panel ) . The resulting contour plot shows good agreement with previous results ( Dunn and Spudich , 2007 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 022 Our ability to clearly distinguish between bound and unbound states during processive motion , allowed us to extract the dwell times of the transient state . We found that it followed a single exponential distribution with a lifetime of 17 . 5 \u00b1 0 . 6 ms . We found no ATP concentration dependence on both the spatial and temporal distributions of the transient state within our experimental error ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The corresponding dwell time distributions for the A and B states followed the behavior expected for processes limited by ATP binding and ADP release ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . In all cases , the dwell times of the A and the B states were identical suggesting that the 20 nm gold particle had no effect on the stepping kinetics . \n Label-sizes of a few tens of nm are traditionally avoided in single particle tracking experiments to prevent the label from perturbing the dynamics of interest . By monitoring the lifetimes of the A and B states , which effectively provides the dwell times of the labeled and unlabeled heads , respectively , we demonstrate that the 20 nm gold particle attached to the N-terminus of myosin has no measureable effect on the kinetics of stepping . If detrimental effects can be excluded experimentally , as in this case , our results show that the larger size of the label can actually be advantageous in revealing structural dynamics that would otherwise remain invisible . Here , the label probes the structural change occurring in the bound head during the power stroke and amplifies it into a nanometer scale motion . Previous studies using gold labels were not able to observe this transition likely due to a combination of a different labeling strategy ( 40 nm or 60 nm gold nanoparticle attached to a calmodulin on the lever arm ) and much lower spatial precision ( >10 nm ) ( Dunn and Spudich , 2007 ) . Several EM studies ( Walker et al . , 2000; Burgess et al . , 2002; Oke et al . , 2010 ) failed to detect any obvious conformational differences in the position of the SH3 ( N-terminal domain ) of lead and trail heads , whereas we now demonstrate a movement of this domain associated with the power stroke taken after the trail head dissociates . This change is consistent with results of molecular dynamic simulations of both myosin 5a and myosin 2 based on crystal structures suggesting that the N-terminus undergoes a rotation during the power stroke transition ( Coureux et al . , 2003; Cecchini et al . , 2008; Preller and Holmes , 2013 ) . Although the original myosin 5 tracking performed with a fluorescently-labeled calmodulin bound to the lever arm at 1 . 5 nm precision revealed 74 nm steps , ( Yildiz et al . , 2003 ) a later study with rigidly attached dye labels on the calmodulin bound to the lever arm suggested that they in fact represent 64\u201310 nm steps ( Syed et al . , 2006 ) . During the acquisition of 4728 steps in 635 trajectories , we never observed a large followed by a small forward step . In our work , we labeled the motor domain directly , while in the previous studies , calmodulin bound to the lever arm was used as an attachment point . Since the lever arm moves significantly during the power stroke , attachment of the dye at this location may suggest a sub-step along actin , even though the motor domain itself does not move . Thus the term \u2018sub step\u2019 is inappropriate for this pattern of movement . In addition , the orientation of single dipoles can have a significant impact on the position obtained from standard Gaussian fitting and exacerbate even very small translocations ( Enderlein et al . , 2006 ) . A recent AFM study ( Kodera et al . , 2010 ) reported that detachment and reattachment of the leading head , a so-called \u2018foot stomp\u2019 contributes to the mechanochemical cycle of myosin 5 . Such behavior was also observed in the single molecule tracking study discussed above , ( Syed et al . , 2006 ) although the frequency of occurrence was not discussed in that work . The sensitivity of our tracking methodology to detachment from actin in three dimensions , however , shows that myosin remains firmly bound to actin with both heads during the mechanochemical cycle irrespective of whether the head is leading or trailing ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , except when the head takes a 74 nm step . Only on very rare occasions did we observe detachment of the leading head . Specifically , only ~3% of steps taken at 1 \u00b5M ATP , ~0 . 6% of steps taken at 10 \u00b5M ATP , none at saturating ATP exhibited this behavior . The unbinding event was not necessarily followed by reattachment at a different site suggesting that these events can be explained simply by the binding equilibria between myosin and actin , rather than being an active component of the stepping mechanism . One likely explanation for the increased occurrence of lead head detachment and reattachment in recent AFM studies ( Kodera et al . , 2010; Ando et al . , 2013 ) is the much lower ATP concentration used or the non-negligible interaction of the AFM tip with the protein . The combination of temporal and spatial precision achieved in this work directly reveals the motion of the unbound head of myosin during translocation . From the two head bound state of myosin 5a , the trailing head detaches from actin upon binding of ATP ( Figure 9A ) . The leading head then undergoes a power stroke that leans the protein forward , a motion that exhibits a strong torsional component ( Komori et al . , 2007; Ohmachi et al . , 2012 ) . After the power stroke , the unbound head arrives at a minimum in the potential energy from where it approaches the next actin binding site in what appears to be a one dimensional biased search . The transient state lifetime agrees with the duration of increased flexibility reported in optical trapping experiments probing the attachment stiffness at high time-resolution ( Veigel et al . , 2002 ) and single molecule tracking of the motor domain ( Dunn and Spudich , 2007; Beausang et al . , 2013 ) . The measured lifetime also correlates well with previously reported ensemble rate constant for the weak-to-strong binding transition ( 47 s\u22121 ) ( Rosenfeld and Sweeney , 2004 ) . The presence of an additional high probability density very close to the final binding site further favors such an interpretation . This density very likely corresponds to the weakly bound state from which the head frequently moves back to the side position . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 023Figure 9 . Mechanism of the myosin step . ( A ) ATP binding to the trailing head ( yellow ) and its detachment releases strain stored in the molecule . ( B ) The bound head ( black with a gold nanoparticle attached ) performs its power stroke which is accompanied by the AB transition ( inset ) . The labeled head becomes a new trailing head ( C ) which detaches after ATP binding . ( D ) It moves forward in a partially twisting motion and occupies an off axis position ( transient state ) . From this position , the head binds the desired binding site while ATP hydrolyses . ( E ) The step completes as the head binds actin and is repeated by the other head in the same direction dictated by the initial torsional strain . ( F ) Schematic representation of both heads' movement ( lateral projection ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 023 An important implication of our data is that the position of the transient state , displaced 40 nm along and perpendicular to the filament is inconsistent with a purely rotational diffusion search . In that case we would require most molecules to be bound parallel to the surface and then expect the average position of the detached head to be displaced \u223c56 nm along and not more than 20 nm perpendicular to the filament ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . We emphasize however , that our data does not contradict previous dark field results , which lead to the rotational diffusion model ( Dunn and Spudich , 2007 ) . We can closely reproduce such results by adding 17 nm of localization noise to our traces . At such localization precision , left- and right- handed walking is no longer distinguishable leading to a probability density map that is no longer one-sided ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . Why the unattached head occupies a positon 40 nm away from the actin filament is a priori puzzling . There is neither an intrinsic reason for the head to pause there , nor is there a binding site present at this position . Our experimental data provides no evidence that the transient state is induced or measurably affected by unwanted interactions caused by the particle or the surface as suggested by the similarity of our transient state lifetime to previous studies with alternative labeling strategies , ( Forkey et al . , 2003; Snyder et al . , 2004; Warshaw et al . , 2005 ) the presence of the transient state for much smaller labels ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , the change in contrast during the step ( Figure 2 ) , the lack of non-specific binding of our label to the surface or actin and any localizations during the one head bound state that coincide with the underlying actin track . This location and the resulting movement , however , become more intuitive when considering that the intrinsic angle between the lever arms is similar to that found when the two heads are bound to actin , that is , \u223c37 nm away from each other . Comparison of electron micrographs of myosin 5 bound to actin ( Walker et al . , 2000 ) and non-specifically bound to a surface in the absence of actin ( Takagi et al . , 2014 ) show clearly peaked angle distributions around 105 and 115\u00b0 , respectively , suggesting a built-in preference for such a spatial arrangement of the two heads , rather than a truly flexible linkage , another indication that a completely free swivel at the neck-linker is unlikely . In this way , keeping the angle between the lever arms roughly intact during stepping and twisting partially about the leading head causes the translocating motor domain to preferentially reach the desired binding site . As a result a full three dimensional search mechanism is minimized to one defined by a one dimensional arc . The position of the transient state together with what appears to be constrained diffusion suggests that myosin side steps along actin in a combined twisting and leaning motion , much more like a drawing compass rather than a freely jointed swivel or human-like gait . In hindsight , such a mechanism has numerous advantages over a search based on full rotational diffusion . It generates a built-in bias for finding the correct binding site and ensures that the head needs to travel and search only along one dimension to find the desired binding site defined by the torsion about the leading head and neck linker rather than a lower probability three-dimensional Brownian search . Even if the motor domain fails to bind strongly on first passage , it swings back and forth between the transient state and the desired actin site until tight binding can occur . This suggests that the structure of myosin 5a facilitates and controls the motion of the unbound head to achieve such high specificity in finding the desired binding site . Our results do not imply that the head is effectively stationary at the transient state position while in the one head bound state . Some degree of diffusional search is inherent to the system and cannot be captured even at our low exposure time of 0 . 56 ms , which is comparable to the positional autocorrelation time we measured ( 0 . 3 ms ) , and predicted theoretically ( Craig and Linke , 2009 ) . The location of the transient state , the fact that in several thousand steps we never observed a single step with transient localizations on both sides of the actin filament , and a predominantly perpendicular orientation of myosin relative to the surface caused by our surface preparation , however , suggest that diffusion is constrained . On the contrary , we believe that this constraint is a key to myosin 5's efficiency in terms of processive motion in contrast to a completely free , spherical search space . The fact that the AB transition and the relative location of the rear-binding site and the transient state are in line has two further important implications . It suggests that the AB transition cannot solely be a consequence of a steric interaction between the label and the lever arm . In that case , we should only observe one type of AB transition , irrespective of whether right or left-handed walking occurs . Furthermore , it shows a connection between the directionality of the N-terminus and lever arm movement . The observed N-terminus domain movement could thus be a signature of the release of this strain . This conformational change , critical for rearrangement of the nucleotide binding pocket and/or closure of the internal cleft , would then allow for finalizing the actomyosin energy transduction . In other words , the energy from the ATPase reaction , stored in the actomyosin complex can only be fully used after the trailing head detaches and the system can relax . Our data shows that the AB transition is associated with the power stroke but it is unlikely that the 20\u00b0 rotation of the N-terminus is directly responsible for the side step per se . The fact that the transient state is either to the left or to the right of the filament implies that it cannot be a pure consequence of the attached lever arm swing . We therefore propose that the position of the transient state and the direction of the AB transition reflect the strain release upon rear head detachment . The initial strain is built up within the head domain and transmitted up to the lever arm during the first binding when one of the heads twists in order to bind to the same actin filament ( Liu et al . , 2006 ) . The simultaneous tracking of the movement of both heads using the combination of gold scattering and fluorescence demonstrates that myosin walks in a symmetric manner where each head movement is accompanied by an 180\u00b0 swing on the same side of the actin filament , unlike a human gait . This type of movement would imply that the cargo also rotates with each step or that a swivel exists to relieve the strain that would otherwise develop between the myosin and the cargo . Such a rotation has been measured by the orientation of quantum rods attached to the myosin 5a tail , although , in this work the source of the rotational movement was thought to be thermal ( Ohmachi et al . , 2012 ) . Our observation that the orientation of the transient state relative to actin may change for the same molecule by binding to another actin filament shows that the position of the transient state relative to actin is not an intrinsic property of individual myosin molecules . Otherwise , we would expect each molecule to preserve the orientation of the transient state even when changing from one filament to another . Instead , the decision is made upon binding to actin , with both cases following the right and left hand preference previously mentioned . With respect to the source of the symmetry breaking , one possible explanation involves the steric interaction with the surface . Depending on the initial binding angle the steric interactions with the surface would determine the direction of rotation . However , if the sidedness was only a consequence of an interaction with the surface , then we would at least expect the molecules that are bound perpendicular to the glass surface and thus have the least interaction with it , to show no preference . Since we never observed transient states on both sides of the filament during individual runs , the reported mechanism is likely to be an intrinsic feature of the myosin 5a stepping . Based on our observation that the transient state for both heads occurs on the same side of the actin filament we propose that the twisting that takes place during the initial binding event of both heads to actin determines the directionality . This initial twist , possibly driven by thermal fluctuations , establishes the direction in which the initial torsional strain is built up and is then repeatedly stored and released as the protein moves along actin . Once the directionality of the transient state has been established , both heads follow the same constrained route resulting in an efficient , unidirectional motion . \n Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared as described ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) and stored in liquid nitrogen until used . A 20 \u03bcM actin stock solution was prepared in polymerisation buffer ( 10 mM imidazole , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA [pH 7 . 3] containing 1 . 7 mM DTT , 3 mM ATP ) . Actin was diluted in motility buffer ( MB; 20 mM MOPS pH 7 . 3 , 5 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 1 mM EGTA ) 20\u201350 times . Mouse myosin 5a HMM with a C-terminal GFP was expressed in the presence of calmodulin and purified as described ( Wang , 2000 ) . In addition , the N-terminus was modified by the addition of a nucleotide sequence encoding an AviTag peptide ( GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE ) for site-specific biotinylation with BirA ligase ( Avidity , Aurora , Colorado ) . After biotinylation , the sample was aliquoted , flash frozen in 20 \u03bcl drops and stored at \u221280\u00b0C . Before labeling , the myosin sample was diluted in MB containing 40 mM KCl , 5 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mg/ml BSA and 5 \u03bcM calmodulin . Gold nanoparticles of 20 nm , 30 nm and 40 nm in diameter conjugated with streptavidin were purchased from BBI ( UK ) and directly mixed with biotinylated myosin 5a sample in a 4:1 , gold to myosin ratio , consistent with one or zero myosin molecules per gold particle . The mixture was incubated on ice for at least 15 min ( sample volume 50 \u03bcl , final concentration of myosin 300 pM ) . The same procedure was used for double gold/Qdot labeling . The quantum dots ( emission maximum 565 ) conjugated with streptavidin were purchased from Invitrogen ( Lifetechnologies , UK ) . For fluorescence only imaging , myosin was incubated for 10 min with Atto-647 streptavidin ( Atto-TEC , Germany ) . The following oxygen scavenger system was used to increase the fluorescent dye stability: 0 . 2 mg/ml glucose oxidase , 0 . 4% wt/vol glucose , 0 . 04 mg/ml catalase , all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich ( UK ) . The flow cell was prepared as described ( Dunn and Spudich , 2011 ) . It was first rinsed with 1 mg/ml solution of poly ( ethylene glycol ) -poly-l-lysine ( PEG-PLL ) branch copolymer ( Surface Solutions SuSoS , Switzerland ) in PBS and incubated for 30 min . Next , it was washed twice with MB before adding the actin solution . After 5 min of incubation , the chamber was washed with MB and the surface was blocked by adding 1 mg/ml BSA in MB buffer . Finally , the chamber was inspected and myosin-gold conjugate solution containing ATP was added . All assays were performed at room temperature . Interferometric scattering microscopy was performed as detailed previously ( Ortega-Arroyo and Kukura , 2012 ) . For two-colour imaging a second diode laser ( 635 nm ) was overlapped with the 445 nm beam path with a dichroic mirror . In the detection arm , the images were separated by an identical optic before being imaged onto two separate CMOS cameras ( MV-D1024-160-CL-8 , Photonfocus , Switzerland ) at 333\u00d7 magnification ( 31 . 8 nm/pixel ) . The incident power was adjusted to 17 . 9 kW/cm2 at the sample to achieve near-saturation of the CMOS camera , which ensured shot noise limited detection . Fluorescence only imaging and tracking was achieved with a home-built TIRF microscope using a 635 nm diode laser . The incident power was set to 5 kW/cm2 and the fluorescence imaged onto an Andor iXon3 860 EM-CCD camera at 72 . 1 nm/pixel with a 9 . 2 \u03bcm \u00d7 9 . 2 \u03bcm field of view using dielectric filters ( Thorlabs , Germany ) to separate illumination and emission . Sample-specific images with shot noise limited sensitivity were obtained by dividing the raw image by a reference flat field image . The flat field reference image containing non-sample specific illumination inhomogeneities , fixed pattern noise and any constant background caused by residual reflections was produced by first recording 2000 images while moving the sample stage with a piezo-driven XY translation stage . The resulting image stack was temporally averaged to 100 frames and each pixel of the flat field reference image was computed as the temporal median value of the frame sequence . Removal of sample specific constant background and thereby increase in the image signal to noise ratio was achieved by obtaining the static background from the sample by averaging at least 10 frames that lacked a signal from the processive myosin 5a molecule labeled with a gold nanoparticle of interest ( Ortega Arroyo et al . , 2014 ) . Nanometric tracking of labeled myosin 5a was achieved by non-linear least square fitting of the point spread function to a two-dimensional Gaussian . Spatiotemporal characterization of the transient state was achieved by alignment of several steps and separation of the states . We segmented each trajectory into step pairs defined as the set containing the data before and after each 74 nm step . These steps were detected manually by using a time interval slider along the 2D trajectory and checking for changes in positional fluctuations . The orientation of the transient state relative to actin was determined and later used to align all steps . To determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of the side step only step pair traces that showed transient states lasting longer than 10 ms were used . First , we fixed the center of mass of the beginning of the step to coordinate position ( 0 , 0 ) . Then , we applied a rotation matrix to the entire step pair trace so that both bound states lie along the horizontal axis . Finally , all aligned step pair traces were overlapped to produce the contour plots shown in Figure 8 and Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1 ."}

These drugs suppress the growth of HIV , but they do not eliminate the virus . If the treatment is interrupted , the virus bounces back within weeks in most individuals . HIV can start growing again because it hides within particular immune cells , called T cells . These infected cells stay in the infected person\u2019s body for their whole life in a dormant or \u201clatent\u201d state , and represent the main barrier to an HIV cure . If these cells could be eliminated or prevented from producing more virus without daily treatment , then HIV could be cured . The fact that HIV hides inside T cells has been known for a long time , but it has remained unclear exactly what kinds of T cells the virus prefers . One challenge to characterizing latently-infected cells is that there is no single protein made by them that is not also made by uninfected T cells . The latently-infected T cells are also very rare: HIV mainly attaches to a protein called CD4 , but only one in about a million T cells with CD4 contain the virus . To figure out which CD4-carrying T cells in a patient sample are latently infected , the cells are extracted from the patient\u2019s body and \u2018reactivated\u2019 so the virus will start growing again . Unfortunately , the mixture of drugs used to reactivate the T cells changes the cells and the proteins they are producing , which obscures the features the latently-infected T cells had before reactivation . Neidleman , Luo et al . developed a new approach to trace the infected , reactivated T cells back to their state before reactivation . Using computational methods and a laboratory technique called mass cytometry , the levels of approximately 40 different proteins were measured in millions of T cells from people living with HIV . These experiments provided an \u2018atlas\u2019 of overall T cell features onto which each reactivated cell could be mapped . The population of latently-infected T cells exhibited common features among all the participants . Selecting a few of the most abundant proteins on the surface of the latently-infected cells allowed these cells to be physically separated from all other immune cells . In the future , this relatively pure population of infected T cells could be used to study how HIV can persist for many decades . The \u2018map\u2019 of these cells\u2019 features will provide a valuable resource for HIV researchers and might enable the discovery of new drugs to eliminate the latent T cells .", "source": "The latent reservoir is a major barrier to HIV cure . As latently infected cells cannot be phenotyped directly , the features of the in vivo reservoir have remained elusive . Here , we describe a method that leverages high-dimensional phenotyping using CyTOF to trace latently infected cells reactivated ex vivo to their original pre-activation states . Our results suggest that , contrary to common assumptions , the reservoir is not randomly distributed among cell subsets , and is remarkably conserved between individuals . However , reservoir composition differs between tissues and blood , as do cells successfully reactivated by different latency reversing agents . By selecting 8\u201310 of our 39 original CyTOF markers , we were able to isolate highly purified populations of unstimulated in vivo latent cells . These purified populations were highly enriched for replication-competent and intact provirus , transcribed HIV , and displayed clonal expansion . The ability to isolate unstimulated latent cells from infected individuals enables previously impossible studies on HIV persistence . \n Combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) suppresses HIV replication but does not eliminate the latent reservoir , which persists for decades in CD4+ T cells and forms a major barrier to HIV\u00a0cure ( Chun et al . , 1997; Finzi et al . , 1997; Wong et al . , 1997 ) . Our understanding of the phenotypic features of latent cells in vivo is limited , in large part because the lack of a universal surface biomarker makes it impossible to directly identify these cells . As a result , fundamental questions remain , such as whether latent cells distribute equally among all CD4+ T cell subsets , and to what extent the reservoir is similar between individuals and between blood and tissues . In the absence of direct ways to phenotype latent cells , characterizing the composition of the HIV reservoir has largely entailed sorting CD4+ T cells based on predefined sets of cell-surface proteins , followed by quantitating HIV through a variety of methods . A vast majority of infected cells in virally\u00a0suppressed individuals harbor defective HIV genomes ( Hiener et al . , 2017; Ho et al . , 2013; Imamichi et al . , 2016; Lee et al . , 2017 ) . Older quantitation methods based on measuring total HIV DNA/RNA levels , regardless of provirus integrity , are being replaced with methods quantitating levels of replication-competent or genome-intact provirus . These methods afford a more accurate picture of the cells leading to viral rebound during treatment interruption , which are the most relevant targets for HIV cure . The \u2018gold standard\u2019 in virus quantitation has been the quantitative viral outgrowth assay ( qVOA;\u00a0Finzi et al . , 1997 ) . qVOA has not identified significant differences in the amount of replication-competent HIV in the most commonly\u00a0studied\u00a0subsets of memory CD4+ T cells \u2013 central memory ( Tcm ) , effector memory ( Tem ) , and transitional memory ( Ttm ) ( Buzon et al . , 2014; Kwon et al . , 2020 ) . Such observations have led many researchers to consider the\u00a0replication-competent reservoir as\u00a0equally\u00a0residing in all cell\u00a0subsets , which if true makes targeting it more difficult . The analysis of proviral sequences , on the other hand , has revealed differences in the frequencies of genome-intact provirus in different sorted subsets . For instance , sequencing of near full-length HIV provirus has identified Th1 and Tem , particularly those that are HLADR+ , as subsets preferentially harboring intact viral genomes ( Hiener et al . , 2017; Horsburgh et al . , 2020; Lee et al . , 2017 ) . Viral sequencing has also revealed many intact proviruses within clonally expanded populations , particularly within the Tem and Th1 subsets , and those expressing Ox40 or CD161 ( De Scheerder et al . , 2019; Hiener et al . , 2017; Kuo et al . , 2018; Lee et al . , 2017; Li et al . , 2019 ) . These and many other studies ( Cohn et al . , 2020; Liu et al . , 2020 ) have solidified the view that clonal expansion plays a major role in maintaining the long-lived HIV reservoir . Although analyses of sorted populations have provided meaningful insights into HIV persistence , they have been limited to comparing cell populations that differ in one or two markers . Thus , they do not provide a comprehensive view of the phenotypic features of latent cells . Several methods have recently enabled the direct phenotyping of reservoir cells at single-cell resolution ( Baxter et al . , 2016; Cohn et al . , 2018; Grau-Exp\u00f3sito et al . , 2017; Pardons et al . , 2019 ) , providing deeper analyses of the reservoir . These methods entail stimulating cells from ART-suppressed patients with a mitogen to induce the\u00a0expression of HIV RNA and/or proteins , which serve as markers for identifying or isolating cells using FACS . However , one important limitation with these methods is that they require ex vivo stimulation before phenotyping\u00a0as viral proteins are not\u00a0typically expressed at detectable levels in unstimulated latent cells ( Baxter et al . , 2016; Cohn et al . , 2018; Pardons et al . , 2019 ) . This stimulation will induce phenotypic changes associated with T cell activation , and expression of HIV accessory genes from reactivation will result in host cell remodeling ( e . g . downregulation of cell-surface CD4 ) , which will further alter the phenotypes of the cells ( Cavrois et al . , 2017; Ma et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , although current methods enable phenotyping of reactivated cells , there is at present no methodology to directly assess the phenotypes of individual latent cells in their original dormant state . To overcome this limitation , we applied the principles behind Predicted Precursor as determined by SLIDE ( PP-SLIDE ) , an analytic method we recently established that combines high-dimensional single-cell phenotyping and computational approaches . We have used PP-SLIDE to predict the state of CD4+ T cells before phenotypic changes induced by productive HIV infection ( Cavrois et al . , 2017; Ma et al . , 2020 ) . Here , we applied it to determine the features of in vivo latent CD4+ T cells before their reactivation by ex vivo stimulation , and validated these findings with patient specimens . Through PP-SLIDE analysis , we were able to address questions fundamental to our understanding of HIV latency and to isolate highly\u00a0enriched populations of replication-competent latent cells for mechanistic studies of reservoir maintenance . \n PP-SLIDE was recently validated as an approach to trace HIV-remodeled cells to their original pre-infection states ( Cavrois et al . , 2017; Ma et al . , 2020 ) . To determine if it can trace reactivated cells to their original latent state , we tested it first in J-Lat cells , an in vitro model of HIV latency . J-Lat cells are Jurkat cells harboring a single integrated HIV provirus that can be reactivated upon stimulation . Multiple lines of J-Lats have been cloned ( Chan et al . , 2013; Jordan et al . , 2003 ) that have diverged slightly over successive passages . We tested how well PP-SLIDE traces reactivated cells back to their original clone when given the choice of two parental clones ( Figure 1A ) . Cells of clone 6 . 3 were reactivated by\u00a0stimulation\u00a0with PMA/ionomycin and phenotyped using a CyTOF T cell panel ( Ma et al . , 2020 ) , along\u00a0with unstimulated cells of clone 6 . 3 and another clone 5A8 . Using PP-SLIDE ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) , the high-dimensional CyTOF-generated information from reactivated 6 . 3 cells ( identified by expression of HIV Gag ) was matched against an atlas of concatenated unstimulated 5A8 and 6 . 3 cells to identify the most similar unstimulated cell for each reactivated 6 . 3 cell . These unstimulated cells , identified using a k-nearest neighbor ( kNN ) approach , are collectively termed \u2018kNN latent cells\u2019 . The error rate , defined as the % of reactivated 6 . 3 cells that matched to unstimulated 5A8 cells , was 0 . 8% ( Figure 1B ) . These results suggest that although reactivation greatly changes the phenotype of a latent cell , some of the original \u2018identity\u2019 of the cell is still retained and that PP-SLIDE can be used to capture this information and thereby identify precursors of reactivated latent cells . Next , we\u00a0applied PP-SLIDE to characterize latent cells from HIV-infected individuals , using a CyTOF panel ( Supplementary file 1 ) that\u00a0is\u00a0directed at markers of the major subsets and differentiation states of CD4+ T cells and includes receptors and intracellular proteins associated with latency ( Banga et al . , 2016; Buzon et al . , 2014; Chomont et al . , 2009; Descours et al . , 2017; Fromentin et al . , 2016; Hogan et al . , 2018; Iglesias-Ussel et al . , 2013; Khoury et al . , 2016; Li et al . , 2019; Serra-Peinado et al . , 2019; Sun et al . , 2015 ) . Since reactivation events are rare and reducing background was key , we conjugated different anti-Gag antibodies to three different metal lanthanides and only considered cells displaying a Gag signal in all three channels as true events . The full panel was validated in vitro ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We collected via leukapheresis CD4+ T cells from the blood of four ART-suppressed HIV-infected individuals ( Supplementary file 2 ) , purified memory CD4+ T cells by negative selection , and separated the cells into two pools ( Figure 2A ) . One pool was used to generate the atlas of unstimulated cells . This pool was phenotyped within 2 hours of cell isolation , and never went through any cryopreservation or ex vivo culture . The other pool was stimulated with PMA/ionomycin under fully suppressive ART ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A ) for 40 hr , a time\u00a0point that precedes mitogen-induced cellular proliferation ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . The CyTOF profiles of reactivated cells were matched against those of the unstimulated atlas cells . Assuming each reactivated cell retained some of its original pre-stimulation identity and that a phenotypically similar cell was present in the atlas of unstimulated cells , we used PP-SLIDE to identify , for each reactivated cell , the nearest-neighbor within the atlas ( Figure 2A ) . These identified cells , the \u2018kNN latent cells\u2019 , harbor the predicted phenotypes of latent cells before their reactivation from latency . We identified between 20 and 96 reactivated cells per specimen , corresponding to a mean frequency of 11 . 3 per million memory ( CD45RA-CD45RO+ ) CD4+ T cells ( range 5 . 6\u201317 . 6 , Figure 2B , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . When visualized against the atlas of unstimulated cells by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ( tSNE;\u00a0van der Maaten , 2009 ) , Gag+ reactivated cells occupied a unique region , confirming their distinct phenotype relative to unstimulated cells ( Figure 2C , left ) . kNN latent cells mapped to several distinct regions of the atlas ( Figure 2C , right ) , suggesting a non-random distribution among memory CD4+ T cells . To verify this , we implemented FlowSOM ( Van Gassen et al . , 2015 ) to subdivide the atlases from each of the four donors into 20 clusters , and visualized the distribution of kNN latent cells on the tSNE maps or on pie graphs ( Figure 2C , center , and 2D ) . We found large clusters lacking kNN latent cells as well as small clusters harboring kNN latent cells , consistent with a non-random distribution of latent cells , which was confirmed using a chi-squared test ( Figure 2D ) . For a detailed description of the extent of enrichment of kNN latent cells in clusters and validation of non-random distribution of the reservoir , see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods . Next , we examined the composition of the kNN latent cells . We focused first on the Tcm , Tem , and Ttm subsets , as they have been the most commonly studied memory CD4+ T cells in the context of HIV latency ( Chomont et al . , 2009; Josefsson et al . , 2013; Kwon et al . , 2020; Pardons et al . , 2019; Soriano-Sarabia et al . , 2014; von Stockenstrom et al . , 2015 ) . In all four donors , the contribution of Tem to the reservoir was greater than its contribution to total memory CD4+ T cells ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We did not identify any kNN latent cells with the Ttm phenotype , likely because this subset is relatively rare in blood and not efficiently captured in our samples , each of which harbored fewer than 100 kNN latent cells . When the three FlowSOM clusters of atlas cells with the highest frequencies of kNN latent cells were examined for the relative contributions of the Tcm , Tem , and Ttm subsets , we found that they were all comprised of multiple subsets ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Collectively , these data demonstrate that although Tem are over-represented among kNN latent cells , the clusters most enriched for kNN latent cells \u2013 as classified by unbiased clustering\u00a0based on\u00a0~40 markers \u2013 are a mixture of Tcm/Tem/Ttm subsets . These findings could suggest that the reservoir is quite different between individuals . Alternatively , they could mean that latency markers shared between individuals are not those used to define Tcm/Tem/Ttm cells . Consistent with the latter , when datasets from the four donors were combined and re-run within the same tSNE , the kNN latent cells from the four donors resided within a similar region of the plot ( Figure 3A ) . These results argue that kNN latent cells between different donors are in fact similar . Consistent with this conclusion , relative to total memory CD4+ T cells , kNN latent cells consistently expressed higher levels of select markers of immune checkpoint ( PD1 , CTLA4 ) , activation ( CD69 , CD25 , HLADR ) , and T cell differentiation states ( Tbet , CRTH2 , CCR6;\u00a0Figure 3B ) . We conclude that in vivo latent cells are not randomly distributed but instead share specific features between individuals . Even though latent cells are similar between individuals , the inter-donor variability in latent cells could still be greater than the intra-donor variability . To test this idea , we obtained leukapheresis specimens from donor PID5003 at two time\u00a0points spaced 2 months apart and compared in an unbiased manner the kNN latent cells from those specimens to kNN latent cells from donor PID3010 ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A , B ) . For each kNN latent cell in the PID3010 sample , we calculated the Euclidean distances ( based on CyTOF parameters ) to every kNN latent cell in the PID5003 sample . Similar calculations were conducted between kNN latent cells from the two time\u00a0points sampled in PID5003 ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A ) . The median distances were lower between specimens from the same donor than from different donors ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C ) , demonstrating that despite the similarity of kNN latent cells between donors , the\u00a0kNN latent cells differ more between donors than within a donor . Next , we took advantage of our ability to obtain high-resolution maps of the phenotypic features of latent cells to compare their reactivation by different ex vivo stimulations . Longitudinal blood specimens were obtained from the same suppressed individual and stimulated with the broad-spectrum mitogens PMA/ionomycin or anti-CD3/CD28 . Euclidean distance calculations ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A ) revealed that PMA/ionomycin-reactivatable kNN latent cells from different collection time\u00a0points were more similar to each other than to anti-CD3/CD28-reactivatable kNN latent cells from the same time\u00a0point ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3D , E ) . Next , we compared the latent cells reactivatable by PMA/ionomycin to those reactivatable by a combination LRA consisting of an HDAC inhibitor together with an ingenol ( Romdepsin/PEP005 ) using three longitudinal blood specimens each spaced 2 months apart . tSNE visualization of the kNN latent cells revealed a region of the plot that harbored kNN latent cells from the PMA/ionomycin samples but not from the Romidepsin/PEP005 samples ( Figure 4A ) . Euclidean distance calculations ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A ) were again used to verify that kNN latent cells reactivatable by the same stimulation at different time\u00a0points were more similar than those reactivatable by different stimulations within the same time\u00a0point ( Figure 4B ) . These data suggest that Romdepsin/PEP005 reactivates only a subset of latent cells reactivatable by broad-spectrum mitogens such as PMA/ionomycin , although these findings should be confirmed with longitudinal specimens from additional donors . Since most of the HIV reservoir persists within tissues ( Estes et al . , 2017 ) , we next applied the PP-SLIDE method of latent cell characterization to tissue specimens . One of the four suppressed participants who had donated a leukapheresis specimen , PID3010 , also agreed to the collection of two sets of lymph node specimens via fine needle aspirates ( FNAs ) spaced 6 months apart . Upon isolation , each FNA was immediately mock-treated or stimulated for 40 hr with PMA/ionomycin and then subjected to PP-SLIDE . Unlike with blood specimens , memory CD4+ T cells were not purified ahead of time since FNAs yielded limited numbers of cells . However , we pre-gated on memory CD4+ T cells to\u00a0compare\u00a0with purified blood cells . The atlases from the three specimens ( one blood , two FNAs ) showed that blood and FNA cells were phenotypically distinct ( Figure 4C ) . The kNN latent cells from the FNAs , similar to those from blood , were not randomly distributed and remained similar across the longitudinal specimens as demonstrated by their occupying similar regions of tSNE space ( Figure 4C ) . Several antigens distinguished kNN latent cells in the\u00a0blood versus tissues . For instance , CD27 , an antigen expressed on Tcm cells , and CD69 , a marker of activation in blood but a T resident memory ( Trm ) marker in tissues ( Cantero-P\u00e9rez et al . , 2019 ) , were more highly expressed on FNA kNN latent cells ( Figure 4D , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . PD1 and CXCR5 , markers of Tfh that are preferentially expressed\u00a0in latent cells particularly in tissues ( Banga et al . , 2016 ) , were also expressed at especially high levels on kNN latent cells from FNAs ( Figure 4D , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . The co-stimulatory molecule ICOS was expressed at high levels on kNN latent cells exclusively in FNAs , while the exhaustion marker TIGIT was more variably expressed ( Figure 4D , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . These results reveal marked differences between the phenotypic features of kNN latent cells in blood versus lymph nodes , with the notable exception of PD1 , which was high in both compartments . We also characterized the reservoir in the gut , the primary site of viral persistence during suppressive therapy ( Estes et al . , 2017 ) . As longitudinal gut specimens were not available , we conducted a cross-sectional analysis comparing gut specimens from four donors to the blood specimens previously analyzed by PP-SLIDE . While differences in the reservoir between the\u00a0blood and gut were observed , some interesting similarities also emerged . kNN latent cells from the gut were mostly CD69hiCD27lo , while those from blood exhibited a much more variable expression pattern of these two antigens ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . By contrast , kNN latent cells from both the\u00a0gut and blood expressed high levels of PD1 but relatively low levels of CXCR5 ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Another similarity was that CTLA4 and CCR6 , previously reported to be preferentially expressed on latent cells from tissues ( Gosselin et al . , 2017; McGary et al . , 2017 ) , were both highly expressed in kNN latent cells from the\u00a0gut and blood . Taken together with the FNA results , these analyses identify CD69 and PD1 as antigens expressed at high levels in kNN latent cells from both gut and lymph nodes , suggesting shared features of the reservoir between different tissue compartments . To compare the global similarities between kNN latent cells from the three compartments ( blood , lymph nodes , gut ) , we visualized the atlas and kNN latent cells of all donors combined using\u00a0tSNE ( Figure 4E ) . Interestingly , the FNA atlas cells appeared equidistant to the blood and gut atlas cells , an observation confirmed by Euclidean distance calculations . By contrast , kNN latent cells from FNA and gut tended to cluster more closely together , away from those from blood , which we also confirmed by Euclidean distance calculations ( Figure 4E ) . Together with the above analyses suggesting that kNN latent cells from both tissue compartments express high levels of CD69 and PD1 , these results suggest that phenotypic features of the reservoir are shared between different tissue sites . That said , a notable difference was that kNN latent cells from FNAs included both na\u00efve and memory cells , while those from the\u00a0gut only included memory cells , potentially due to the under-representation of na\u00efve cells within the gut compartment ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . To determine whether surface markers differentially expressed on kNN latent cells can enrich for the replication-competent reservoir , we custom-designed sorting strategies for each of the four donor blood specimens . Because PD1 is arguably the most validated surface marker of latent cells ( Banga et al . , 2016; Chomont et al . , 2009; Fromentin et al . , 2016; Pardons et al . , 2019 ) , we compared the additional enrichment afforded by our sorting strategy to that afforded by PD1 selection alone . Our panels took into account the expression levels of\u00a0markers\u00a0in kNN latent cells , the numbers of cryopreserved cells available from the participant , and the overall abundance of the populations in each sequential gate . The latter two aspects were important considerations as an infrequent population of cells may be highly enriched for kNN latent cells but too rare to sort in sufficient numbers for viral outgrowth and other downstream assays . We arrived at panels of 8\u201310 markers individualized for each participant . For each donor specimen , we isolated a PD1+ population that we submitted to further selection with the relevant marker panel ( enriched ) and two PD1+ populations that we did not subject to further selection ( disenriched ) . The disenriched populations harbored markedly lower frequencies of kNN latent cells than the enriched one ( Figure 5 ) . These populations were sorted ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) and subjected to multiple assays . We first conducted a viral outgrowth assay . Because sorting based on our 8\u201310 marker panels yielded few cells , we modified the qVOA accordingly . Sorted cells were stimulated in bulk for 2 days with anti-CD3/CD28 , and plated into individual wells at various dilutions . The HIV-permissive MOLT-CCR5 cell line was added to propagate viral replication , and after 2 weeks supernatants were quantitated for viral outgrowth by p24 ELISA . Replication was scored as the proportion of wells that had outgrowth and as the concentration of p24 in each well . Both scoring methods revealed strikingly more outgrowth in the enriched relative to both disenriched populations in all four donors ( Figure 6A ) . In fact , most disenriched populations did not result in any outgrowth even at the highest concentration tested ( 200 , 000 cells/well ) . The enriched populations also harbored more replication-competent HIV than total memory CD4+ T cells ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Because recent studies suggest that the in vivo reservoir is transcriptionally active ( Yukl et al . , 2018 ) , we assessed HIV transcription initiation , elongation , and completion in the sorted populations . In the absence of stimulation , HIV transcriptional activity was observed in the sorted cells , with more transcription initiation in the enriched than disenriched ones in 7/8 instances ( Figure 6B ) . These results suggest that populations highly enriched for the replication-competent reservoir initiate HIV transcription in the absence of stimulation . We then assessed to what extent our 8\u201310 marker panels enrich for latent cells harboring intact genomes . We sequenced by FLIPS ( Hiener et al . , 2017 ) proviruses from the enriched and from one of the disenriched populations , for each of three donors . Consistent with the PP-SLIDE and outgrowth results , enriched cells harbored higher frequencies of intact p24 sequences than disenriched ones ( Figure 6C ) . To assess the extent of clonal expansion , a major driver of HIV persistence ( Cohn et al . , 2020; Liu et al . , 2020 ) , we determined the proportions of expanded identical sequences ( EIS ) . EIS were prominent in both populations , but the proportions of EIS with intact p24 sequences were consistently higher in the enriched ones ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . A phylogenetic analysis of the sequences revealed that in two of the donors ( PID1695 and PID5003 ) , EIS from the enriched and disenriched populations formed distinct lineages , while in donor PID3010 multiple EIS were shared between the enriched and disenriched populations ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . As the enriched population from PID5003 harbored a particularly high frequency of intact p24 sequences , we analyzed this donor in more detail . We categorized all the sequences analyzed from this individual into those that were full-length intact ( i . e . no defects along the entire proviral genome ) , and those harboring large internal deletions , hypermutations , premature stop codons , and inversions . Remarkably , 65 . 2% of the enriched population was fully intact , compared to only 0 . 9% for the disenriched population ( Figure 6D ) . This corresponded to an overall frequency of 214 full-length intact sequences per million in the enriched population , as compared to only two per million in the disenriched population . The vast majority ( 95 . 5% ) of the proviruses in the disenriched population harbored large internal deletions . EIS were prominent among both populations ( Figure 6E ) . Among the EIS in the enriched population , 66 . 7% were fully intact , compared to 0% in the disenriched population . Fully-intact EIS in the enriched population comprised two groups , suggesting two major expansions of replication-competent reservoir cells in this population of cells highly enriched for replication-competent HIV ( Figure 6E ) . Collectively , these results show that surface markers identified by PP-SLIDE can be used to enrich for replication-competent latent cells and that these cells are enriched for the transcriptionally active reservoir and exhibit clear evidence of clonal expansion of fully-intact proviruses . The sort panels implemented above were tailored for each donor specimen . Given that some features of kNN latent cells are shared between individuals ( Figure 3 ) , we set out to design a universal panel to enrich for latent cells in a donor-independent fashion . We designed a sorting strategy incorporating eight surface antigens that enrich for kNN latent cells from all four blood specimens analyzed ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5 ) . As TIGIT was found to be expressed at high levels on kNN latent cells in some but not all donors ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5 ) , we designed a strategy to isolate two enriched populations \u2013 one TIGIThigh and one TIGITmed/low \u2013 to test the hypothesis that TIGIT is indeed not a marker of latent cells shared between donors . These populations were compared to a PD1+ population disenriched for kNN latent cells ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5 ) . We applied this \u2018universal\u2019 panel on four donor blood specimens ( Supplementary file 2 ) that had not undergone PP-SLIDE analysis ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 6 ) . Viral outgrowth assays revealed robust outgrowth in the enriched but not disenriched populations ( Figure 6F ) . Furthermore , the TIGIThigh population harbored more viruses in some donors and the TIGITmed/low one in others , validating the notion that TIGIT is not a marker of latent cells shared between donors . These results suggest that shared features between kNN latent cells can be exploited to enrich for the replication-competent latent reservoir across donors . \n Although the latent reservoir has long been recognized as a major barrier to HIV cure , the phenotype of these latently infected cells in vivo has remained somewhat obscure . A common viewpoint , based on the limited number of studies that have conducted viral outgrowth assays on sorted cell populations , is that latent HIV persists in all types of CD4+ T cells with no preference for one subset over another . If so , targeting latently\u00a0infected cells as a curative strategy would be all the more difficult . Taking advantage of recent developments in high-parameter single-cell phenotyping and our PP-SLIDE analysis pipeline , we now show that latently\u00a0infected cells are not randomly distributed among CD4+ T cells , and provide an in-depth view of the phenotypic features of the in vivo blood and tissue reservoir . Multiple observations make us confident that PP-SLIDE identifies the physiologically relevant reservoir . First , our in vitro assay with J-Lat cells showed the method could predict the correct precursor cell 99 . 2% of the time . Second , cells sorted based on PP-SLIDE were enriched for genome-intact and replication-competent reservoir cells in the expected populations . Of note , our PP-SLIDE characterization had charted the translation-competent reservoir , defined as latent cells able to produce viral proteins upon stimulation ( Baxter et al . , 2018 ) , which may include some replication-incompetent HIV provirus ( Baxter et al . , 2016; Imamichi et al . , 2020 ) . Nevertheless , our viral outgrowth results closely aligned with the enrichment of kNN latent cells , confirming that PP-SLIDE identifies markers of the replication-competent HIV reservoir most relevant for a cure . Third , using our \u2018universal panel , \u2019 we validated the preferential presence of the replication-competent reservoir in expected populations in four untested donors , and PP-SLIDE\u2019s prediction that the latent reservoir is preferentially maintained in TIGIT-expressing cells in some but not all donors . The sorting strategies used in our validation experiments were designed to enable comparison of different populations of memory CD4+ T cells expressing high levels of PD1 , a marker preferentially expressed on reservoir cells ( Banga et al . , 2016; Chomont et al . , 2009; Fromentin et al . , 2016; Pardons et al . , 2019 ) and which we found expressed at high levels on kNN latent cells . This was implemented for two reasons: First , to demonstrate that we can enrich for latent cells beyond the selection afforded by PD1 alone . Indeed both our viral outgrowth and proviral sequencing results confirmed PP-SLIDE\u2019s prediction that some but not all PD1-expressing memory CD4+ T cells harbor high frequencies of latent HIV . Second , to enable mechanistic comparisons of highly similar populations of sorted cells harboring vastly different levels of replication-competent HIV . We found that in 7/8 cases , the enriched populations initiated more HIV transcription than their disenriched counterparts , suggesting that the transcriptionally active reservoir associates most closely with the replication-competent reservoir and therefore should be a target of HIV curative strategies . We also found that relative to disenriched populations , the enriched ones harbored higher proportions of EIS with intact p24 , consistent with the importance of clonal expansion in driving the\u00a0maintenance of the replication-competent HIV reservoir ( Bui et al . , 2017; Hosmane et al . , 2017; Lorenzi et al . , 2016 ) , although it should be noted that cells with different integration sites can harbor the same proviral sequence ( Patro et al . , 2019 ) . Of particular interest was our in-depth comparison of two PD1-expressing memory CD4+ T cell populations from PID5003 . A striking 65 . 2% of proviruses in the enriched population from this donor were fully intact , versus 0 . 9% in the disenriched , despite both being PD1 expressors . To put these numbers in perspective , on average only 2\u20133% of sequences from infected individuals treated during chronic infection are intact ( Bruner et al . , 2016; Hiener et al . , 2017 ) . The overall frequency of intact provirus in the enriched PID5003 population was also extremely high: at 214 per million cells , it was more than an order of magnitude higher than what is observed in Tem ( range\u00a0=\u00a01\u201326 , median , 13 per million ) , the subset with the highest frequencies of intact provirus as assessed by FLIPS ( Hiener et al . , 2017 ) . This high frequency is not due to an unusually large overall reservoir in this donor , as the phenotypically-similar ( PD1+ ) disenriched population sequenced from this donor exhibited a frequency of only two per million . Our observation that this enriched population , but not the disenriched one , exhibited robust viral outgrowth , further suggests that the intact proviruses in this population are replication-competent . Interestingly , the intact sequences in this enriched population consisted of two large clusters of EIS , suggesting two major clonal expansions in this well-defined population of memory CD4+ cells sorted based\u00a0on eight surface markers . As these two clusters of viral sequences likely integrated at different genomic sites , these observations support a host rather than virus-driven expansion of these latent cells . That we could find such vastly different levels of intact and replication-competent reservoir cells in our enriched versus disenriched populations goes against the notion that the reservoir is \u2018everywhere\u2019 and randomly distributed in all subsets . But how do our observations fit with prior reports that the frequencies of replication-competent provirus , as determined from outgrowth assays , were similar between sorted subsets ( Buzon et al . , 2014; Kwon et al . , 2020 ) ? We believe that the previously sorted subsets were not ones that differ markedly in reservoir frequencies . Most prior subset analyses had focused on the Tem and Tcm subsets , and when focusing on just these subsets our PP-SLIDE results indeed support the notion that both Tem and Tcm were prominent among kNN latent cells . However , our finding that the proportions of Tem were greater among the kNN latent cells than among atlas cells suggests that latency is somewhat biased toward the Tem subset , a finding in line with the higher prevalence of intact provirus in Tem over Tcm ( Hiener et al . , 2017 ) . Further supporting a non-random distribution of the reservoir is our identification of markers consistently expressed at higher levels on kNN latent cells relative to memory CD4+ T cells . Such markers include ones previously implicated in latency ( PD1 , CTLA4 , Ox40 ) ( Banga et al . , 2016; Fromentin et al . , 2016; Kuo et al . , 2018; McGary et al . , 2017 ) , some activation markers ( CD25 , CD69 ) , and markers of Th1 , Th2 , and Th17 cells ( Tbet , CRTh2 , and CCR6 , respectively ) suggesting preferential persistence of HIV in more differentiated cells . The reservoir may persist in these cells due to antigen- or homeostatically-driven expansion of these cells which can maintain the reservoir through repeated cycles of clonal expansion . Our analysis of longitudinal specimens by PP-SLIDE also provided insights into the stability of the reservoir and its capacity for reactivation . By comparing kNN latent cells from different donors versus longitudinal samples , we found intra-individual variability to be less than inter-individual variability . This observation implies that the phenotypic properties of the reservoir are stable over time , a feature that may facilitate its targeting . In fact , longitudinal stability also held for the reservoir\u2019s susceptibility to the LRAs we tested . Our observation that different stimulatory signals reactivate different latent cells further suggests that \u2018shock and kill\u2019 strategies may require multiple LRAs , each preferentially targeting different cell subsets , as recently suggested ( Baxter et al . , 2016; Grau-Exp\u00f3sito et al . , 2019; Pardons et al . , 2019 ) . Although our study focused on the blood reservoir for logistical and technical reasons , we also conducted PP-SLIDE analyses on tissue specimens . Perhaps not surprising given the known phenotypic differences between T cells from blood versus tissues ( Wong et al . , 2015 ) , we found that blood and tissue kNN latent cells differ quite dramatically . High-dimensional distance calculations revealed that kNN latent cells were more similar between lymph node and gut than between the tissues and blood , suggesting phenotypic commonalities in the latent reservoir found in tissues . Indeed , kNN latent cells from both lymph node and gut expressed high levels of the Trm marker CD69 , suggesting that Trm in these tissues , like those from the cervix ( Cantero-P\u00e9rez et al . , 2019 ) , preferentially harbor the reservoir . Together with our observation that kNN latent cells from all sites examined expressed high levels of PD1 , these results suggest PD1-expressing Trm as possible targets to eliminate the tissue reservoir . Given recent findings that blood , lymph nodes , and gut are the major sources of HIV dissemination in ART-suppressed individuals ( Chaillon et al . , 2020 ) , targeting latent cells in the compartments analyzed in this study may be sufficient to make a meaningful reduction in the reservoir . Our study has some limitations , in particular , a relatively small sample size of only eight blood and five tissue donors , although some donors were characterized longitudinally . Nonetheless , our findings do not support the existence of a single surface biomarker that can be used to target the entire HIV reservoir at once . However , PP-SLIDE enables in-depth charting of the latent reservoir residing in the\u00a0blood and , likely , any tissue we can access . For therapeutic applications , surface antigens identified by PP-SLIDE as preferentially co-expressed on latent cells can be targeted with a series of bi- or multi-specific antibodies ( Klein et al . , 2016 ) . More importantly , our ability to isolate highly enriched populations of replication-competent reservoir cells enables in-depth functional analyses of the reservoir and potentiates future implementation of discovery-based approaches such as scRNAseq and PCR-activated cell sorting ( PACS; Bradley et al . , 2018; Clark and Abate , 2017 ) . These approaches hold great promise for identifying novel markers for HIV eradication but require a high frequency of latent cells that was not achievable previously . We envision that implementing PP-SLIDE on cells phenotyped by scRNAseq together with Antibody-seq approaches ( Peterson et al . , 2017; Stoeckius et al . , 2017 ) will enable even higher-resolution mapping , with the added advantage that whole-transcriptome approaches do not require pre-defining markers of interest , and allow for the discovery of unanticipated\u2014and perhaps unique\u2014markers of latent cells . \n Multiple leukapheresis samples were obtained from eight HIV-1 subtype-B individuals on long-term ART who initiated therapy during chronic ( >1 year ) infection and were stably suppressed ( HIV RNA\u00a0<40 copies/mL; Supplementary file 2 ) . Leukapheresis specimens from four of these eight individuals were subjected to full analyses using CyTOF/PP-SLIDE . Lymph node specimens were obtained from one of these four participants under local anesthesia using ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration . All fine needle aspirate ( FNA ) procedures were performed without any adverse effects , and the subject reported minimal to no discomfort both during and after the procedure and was able to perform their usual activities after the procedure . Gut specimens were obtained by sigmoid biopsies from four ART-suppressed HIV-infected participants ( Supplementary file 2 ) . All participants provided informed consent before participation . The study was approved by the University of California , San Francisco ( IRB # 10\u201301330 ) and the University of North Carolina ( IRB # 12\u20131660 ) . Memory CD4+ T cells from the\u00a0blood of two HIV-seronegative donors were purified as described above , and then resuspended at 2 \u00d7 107 cells/mL in PBS containing 0 . 1% FBS . The cells were then loaded for 8 min with 1 . 5 \u03bcM of the proliferation dye CFSE ( ThermoFisher ) . Labeling was then stopped by the\u00a0addition of an equal volume of pre-warmed , 100% FBS , and the labeled cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for an additional 10 min . The sample was then washed three times in RP10 . Memory CD4+ T cells not exposed to CFSE were treated identically in parallel . The time\u00a0=\u00a00 specimen was immediately stained as described below . The remaining cells were cultured with or without activation with 16 nM PMA , 1 \u03bcM ionomycin , and 100 IU/mL IL2 ( all three reagents from Thermofisher ) . At the indicated time\u00a0points , cells were stained with APC/Cyanine7 anti-human CD3 ( Clone SK7 , Biolegend ) , PE/Cy7 anti-human CD4 ( Clone A161A1 , Biolegend ) , Alexa Fluor 700 anti-human CD8 ( Clone SK1 , Biolegend ) , and Zombie Red ( Biolegend ) as a Live/Dead discriminator . Stained cells were fixed and analyzed by FACS on an LSRII ( BD Biosciences ) . Flowjo ( BD Biosciences ) was used for analysis . Live , singlet CD3+CD4+CD8- cells were assessed for proliferation by monitoring the loss of CFSE signal . Results shown are from one of two donors which gave similar results . 293 T cells were seeded in 6-well plates ( Falcon ) at a concentration of 3 \u00d7 105 cells/well , and transfected the next day using FuGENE ( Promega ) with 0 . 5 \u03bcg/well of the F4 . GFP or F4 . HSA proviral constructs previously described ( Cavrois et al . , 2017; Ma et al . , 2020; Neidleman et al . , 2017 ) . Supernatants from the cultures were harvested after 2 days and p24Gag concentrations were measured with a Lenti-X p24 Rapid Titer kit ( Clontech ) . To demonstrate that the cocktail of ART used in this study was fully suppressive , PBMC-derived CD4+ T cells from HIV-seronegative donors were activated for 2 days with RP10 containing 10 \u03bcg PHA ( PeproTech ) and 100 IU/mL IL2 ( Thermofisher ) , washed with RP10 , and then cultured in 20 IU/mL IL2 for one additional day . The cells were then either left untreated , or pretreated for 1 hr with an ART cocktail consisting of 5 \u03bcM AZT , 5 \u03bcM Ritonavir , 8 nM Efavirenz , 10 \u03bcM Lamivudine , 50 nM Raltegravir , and 0 . 5 \u03bcg/mL T-20 ( all from NIH AIDS reagent program ) . Cells were then cultured for 4 days at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 106 cells/mL with RP10 alone or in the presence of 250 ng/mL p24Gag F4 . GFP in RP10 containing 20 IU/mL IL2 . The cells were then stained for 30 min at 4\u00b0C at a concentration of 106 cells/well in FACS buffer , with anti-CD3 APC/Cyanine7 , anti-CD4 PE/Cy7 , anti-CD8 Alexa Fluor 700 , and Zombie Aqua as a Live/Dead discriminator ( all from Biolegend ) . The cells were then washed three times with FACS buffer and fixed overnight in 2% PFA ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . The cells were analyzed on an LSRII ( BD Biosciences ) and Flowjo software was used to gate on live , singlet CD3+CD8- cells and infection rates in these cells were monitored by GFP expression . For atlas generation , we used freshly isolated and purified memory CD4+ T cells from blood , or freshly isolated total cells from tissues ( as described above ) . A portion of these cells was immediately treated with cisplatin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) as a Live/Dead marker and fixed . Briefly , 6 \u00d7 106 cells were resuspended at room temperature in 2 mL PBS ( Rockland ) with 2 mM EDTA ( Corning ) . Next , 2 mL of PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 25 \u03bcM cisplatin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) were added to the cells . The cells were quickly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 60 s , after which 10 mL of CyFACS ( metal contaminant-free PBS [Rockland] supplemented with 0 . 1% FBS and 0 . 1% sodium azide [Sigma-Aldrich] ) was added to quench the reaction . The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 2% PFA in CyFACS and incubated for 10 min at room temperature . The cells were then washed twice in CyFACS , after which they were resuspended in 100 \u03bcL of CyFACS containing 10% DMSO . These fixed cells were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis by CyTOF . The rest of the freshly isolated cells were stimulated to allow for latent cell reactivation . These cells were diluted to 2 \u00d7 106 cells/mL and stimulated with 16 nM PMA ( Sigma-Aldrich ) and 1 \u03bcM ionomycin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) for 40 hr . This stimulation time was chosen as it is similar to times previously implemented ( Cohn et al . , 2018 ) and shorter stimulations under these conditions did not lead to reactivation . Where indicated , cells were instead stimulated with Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD38 beads ( Gibco ) , or 12 nM PEP005 ( Ingenol 3-angelate , Sigma-Aldrich ) with 40 nM romidepsin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . For gut specimens , to minimize cellular toxicity , cells were instead stimulated for 16 hr with 160 nM PMA and 1 \u03bcM ionomycin . All stimulations were conducted in the presence of 100 IU/mL IL2 ( Thermofisher ) . To prevent spreading infection , a cocktail of ART consisting of 5 \u03bcM AZT , 5 \u03bcM Ritonavir , 8 nM Efavirenz , 10 \u03bcM Lamivudine , 50 nM Raltegravir , and 0 . 5 \u03bcg/mL T-20 was added . To limit the\u00a0death of reactivated cells , 10 \u03bcM of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK ( R and D Systems Inc ) was added as previously described ( Cohn et al . , 2018; Grau-Exp\u00f3sito et al . , 2019 ) . Staining of cells for analysis by CyTOF was conducted similar to recently described methods ( Cavrois et al . , 2017; Ma et al . , 2020; Trapecar et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , cisplatin-treated cells were thawed and washed in Nunc 96 DeepWell polystyrene plates ( Thermo Fisher ) with CyFACS buffer at a concentration of 6 \u00d7 106 cells/800 \u03bcL per well . Cells were then pelleted and blocked with mouse ( Thermo Fisher ) , rat ( Thermo Fisher ) , and human AB ( Sigma-Aldrich ) sera for 15 min at 4\u00b0C . The samples were then washed twice in CyFACS , pelleted , and stained in a 100 \u03bcL cocktail of surface antibodies ( Supplementary file 1 ) for 45 min at 4\u00b0C . The samples were then washed 3\u00d7 with CyFACS and fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C in 100 \u03bcL of freshly prepared 2% PFA in PBS ( Rockland ) . Samples were then washed twice with Intracellular Fixation and Permeabilization Buffer ( eBioscience ) and incubated in this buffer for 45 min at 4\u00b0C . Next , samples were washed twice in Permeabilization Buffer ( eBioscience ) . The samples were then blocked for 15 min at 4\u00b0C in 100 \u03bcL of mouse and rat sera diluted in Permeabilization Buffer , washed 1\u00d7 with Permeabilization buffer , and incubated for 45 min at 4\u00b0C in a 100 \u03bcL cocktail of intracellular antibodies ( Supplementary file 1 ) diluted in Permeabilization Buffer . The cells were then washed with CyFACS and stained for 20 min at room temperature with 250 nM of Cell-ID Intercalator-IR ( Fluidigm ) . Finally , the cells were washed 2\u00d7 with CyFACS buffer , once with MaxPar cell staining buffer ( Fluidigm ) , and once with Cell acquisition solution ( CAS , Fluidigm ) , and then resuspended in EQ Four Element Calibration Beads ( Fluidigm ) diluted to 1\u00d7 in CAS . The\u00a0sample concentration was adjusted to acquire at a rate of 200\u2013350 events/sec using a wide-bore ( WB ) injector on a CyTOF2 instrument ( Fluidigm ) at the UCSF Parnassus flow core facility . For tissue specimens where multiple specimens were combined to minimize cell loss , the Cell-ID 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit ( Fluidigm ) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to barcode the individual cisplatin-treated samples before mixing . Briefly , the frozen and fixed samples were thawed and washed once with CyFACS and 2\u00d7 with Maxpar Barcode Perm Buffer ( Fluidigm ) , and then resuspended in 800 \u03bcL of Barcode Perm Buffer . A total of 10 \u03bcL of each barcode was diluted in 100 \u03bcL of Barcode Permeabilization Buffer and added to each sample . The samples were barcoded for 30 min at room temperature , washed once with MaxPar cell staining buffer , and once with CyFACS . The samples were then combined subjected to the CyTOF staining protocol as described above . Memory CD4+ T cells purified from cryopreserved PBMCs as described above were sorted using the following antibodies . Antibody clone numbers are indicated in the table further below: Dead cells were excluded using the Zombie Aqua fixable viability kit ( BioLegend ) , while doublets were excluded based on FSC-A/FSC-H . Cells were sorted on an Aria FACS sorter ( Becton Dickinson ) . The purity of the subsets was confirmed by analysis on the Aria immediately post-sort .

Of note , all populations of cells were sorted before stimulation to account for any effects of the sorting process on viral outgrowth . After 48 hr of culture , cells were diluted to a concentration of 105 cells/mL in RPMI supplemented with 60 IU/mL recombinant human IL-2 , and then plated at 2 \u00d7 105 cells per well ( dilution A ) , 4 \u00d7 104 cells per well ( dilution B ) , 8 \u00d7 103 cells per well ( dilution C ) , and 1 . 6 \u00d7 103 cells per well ( dilution D ) . Molt4/CCR5 cells ( Laird et al . , 2013 ) were then added at 105 cells per well . Cultures were replenished at days 3 , 6 , 12 , and 15 by replacing half of the media with RPMI containing 5 IU/mL IL-2 without disturbing the cellular layer . On day 9 , half the cultures , inclusive of both cells and media , were discarded , and the remaining cells were replenished with the same volume of RPMI containing 105 Molt4/CCR5 cells . At the end of the culture period ( days 15\u201318 ) , supernatants were quantitated for levels of p24 antigen by ELISA ( Takara ) . A viral outgrowth assay was conducted for one of the gut specimens ( PID1223 ) to demonstrate the presence of replication-competent virus in the tissue . To this end , a Digital ELISA Viral Outgrowth ( DEVO ) assay was implemented . Pooled biopsy cells were plated in a limiting dilution format at five replicates at 470 , 000 cells per well , 12 replicates at 100 , 000 cells per well , and 12 replicates at 25 , 000 cells per well . Cells were stimulated for 24 hr with 3 \u00b5g/mL phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) ( Thermofisher ) , 100 IU/mL IL-2 , and irradiated PBMCs from an HIV-seronegative donor . The cells were washed and Molt4/CCR5 target cells were added to amplify outgrowth of HIV . The cultures were replenished with fresh media every 3\u20134 days , and another round of Molt4/CCR5 cells added on day 9 post-stimulation . Supernatants were harvested on days 9 , 13 , 16 , 20 , 26 , and 29 post-stimulation and assessed for HIV p24 using the SIMOA HD-1 Analyzer ( Quanterix , Billerica , MA ) . Only wells exhibiting sustained and increasing p24 expression over time were scored as positive . The frequency of infection reported as Infectious Units Per Million ( IUPM ) of rectal-sigmoid cells was calculated using the SLDAssay R software package ( Trumble et al . , 2017 ) . The IUPM from this analysis was 0 . 265 , with 95% confidence intervals between 0 . 0216 and 1 . 400 . Of note , this IUPM corresponds to that of total gut cells . Pellets of sorted cells were lysed in 1 mL TRI reagent with 2 . 5 \u03bcL polyacryl carrier ( Molecular Research Center ) . Total cellular RNA was subsequently extracted per the TRI Reagent protocol , while total cellular DNA was extracted using the \u2018back extraction buffer\u2019 ( 4M guanidine thiocyanate , 50 mM sodium citrate , 1M Tris ) as described ( Yukl et al . , 2018 ) . A common reverse transcriptase ( RT ) reaction was used to generate cDNA for all droplet digital PCR ( ddPCR ) assays except TAR , where a separate two-step RT was performed as described ( Yukl et al . , 2018 ) . Briefly , each 50 \u00b5L RT reaction contained cellular RNA , 5 \u00b5L of 10\u00d7 Superscript III buffer ( Invitrogen ) , 5 \u00b5L of 50 mM MgCl2 , 2 . 5 \u00b5L of 50 ng / \u00b5L random hexamers ( Invitrogen ) , 2 . 5 \u00b5L of 50 \u00b5M dT15 , 2 . 5 \u00b5L of 10 mM dNTPs , 1 . 25 \u00b5L of 40 U / \u00b5L RNaseOUT ( Invitrogen ) , and 2 . 5 \u00b5L of 200 U / \u00b5L Superscript III RT ( Invitrogen ) . PBMCs from uninfected donors , and water that was subjected to nucleic extraction by TRI Reagent , served as negative controls for each transcript . The thermocycling conditions were as follows: 25\u00b0C for 10 min , 50\u00b0C for 50 min , and an inactivation step at 85\u00b0C for 5 min . For the ddPCR reactions , cDNA from each sample was assayed in duplicate wells for TAR , Long LTR , Pol , and PolyA regions using validated assays ( Kaiser et al . , 2017; Telwatte et al . , 2018; Yukl et al . , 2018 ) . Total cell equivalents in the DNA extracted from the same samples were determined by measuring the absolute copy numbers of a nonduplicated cellular gene , Telomere Reverse Transcriptase ( TERT ) , similar to previously described methods ( Telwatte et al . , 2018; Yukl et al . , 2018 ) . To account for the effects of deletions or hypermutations on the HIV RNA measurements , all HIV RNAs were further normalized to HIV DNA measured by the same assay used for the RNA . Each 20 \u00b5L ddPCR reaction contained 5 \u00b5L cDNA or DNA , 10 \u00b5L of ddPCR Supermix for Probes ( no dUTP ) ( Bio-Rad , Hercules ) , 900 nM of primers , and 250 nM of probe . Following production of droplet emulsions using the QX100 Droplet Generator ( Bio-Rad ) , samples were amplified under the following thermocycling conditions using a 7900 Thermal Cycler ( Life Technologies ) : 10 min at 95\u00b0C , 45 cycles of 30 s at 95\u00b0C and 59\u00b0C for 60 s , and a final droplet cure step of 10 min at 98\u00b0C . Droplets were quantified using the QX100 Droplet Reader ( Bio-Rad ) and analyzed using the QuantaSoft software ( version 1 . 6 . 6 , Bio-Rad ) in the \u2018Rare Event Detection\u2019 quantification mode . The FLIPS assay was performed as previously reported ( Hiener et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , HIV-1 proviruses within sorted CD4+ T cell subsets were amplified and sequenced at limiting dilution to near full-length ( 9 kb; 92% of the genome ) . A median of 140 individual proviruses ( range 18\u2013254 ) was sequenced per sorted population of cells from three of the four participant blood specimens analyzed by PP-SLIDE . The\u00a0next-generation sequencing was conducted using the Illumina MiSeq platform with individual proviruses de novo assembled using a specifically designed workflow in CLC Genomics . Proviruses were characterized as defective if they contained INDELs , stop codons , or APOBEC3G hypermutations , or intact ( full-length ) if they lacked such defects . Expanded identical sequences ( EIS ) were identified using ElimDupes from the Los Alamos database ( https://www . hiv . lanl . gov/content/sequence/elimdupesv2/elimdupes . html ) . All sequences that were 100% identical were considered part of an EIS cluster . Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees using the generalized time-reversible model were estimated for each participant using Geneius . Branch support was inferred using 1000 bootstrap replicates . Annotated tree images were constructed using the iTOL software Version 5 . 5 . 1 ( Letunic and Bork , 2019 ) . The CyTOF data were exported as FCS files , and samples were de-barcoded according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions ( Fluidigm ) . For the J-Lat experiments , equal numbers of the unstimulated live , singlet intact 6 . 3 and 5A8 were concatenated together as a source of the \u2018atlas cells\u2019 . Reactivated 6 . 3 cells were identified by gating on the Gag-expressing cells in the stimulated 6 . 3 sample . For patient samples , events corresponding to live , singlet intact CD3+CD19-CD8- T cells from unstimulated samples were exported as a source of the atlas cells . Events corresponding to reactivated cells were identified by gating upon live , singlet intact CD3+CD19-CD8- T cells expressing Gag on all three Gag channels , and exported as the population of reactivated cells . Where indicated , na\u00efve cells ( CD45RA+CD45RO- ) were gated out before export . Data export was conducted using FlowJo ( BD Biosciences ) and Cytobank software . tSNE analyses were performed using the Cytobank software with default settings . All cellular markers not used in the upstream gating strategy were included in generating the tSNE plots . Non-cellular markers ( e . g . live/dead stain ) and the HIV gag proteins were excluded for the generation of tSNE plots . Dot plots were generated using both Cytobank and FlowJo . PP-SLIDE analysis to identify kNN latent cells followed our previously described method ( Cavrois et al . , 2017; Ma et al . , 2020 ) . Using a custom script in R ( source code made available as part of manuscript ) , each reactivated ( Gag+ ) cell from the stimulated sample was mapped against every cell in the unstimulated atlas generated immediately after sample procurement , to identify the kNN latent cells for each patient sample . The steps implemented for PP-SLIDE are summarized below: To assess the intra-individual and inter-individual variability in kNN latent cells and to compare kNN latent cells reactivated following treatment with PMA/ionomycin , anti-CD3/CD28 , and Romidepsin/PEP005 , empirical cumulative distributions were calculated . The distributions of median distances in 32-dimensional space ( corresponding to measured protein levels of antigens not used in the upstream gating strategy ) corresponded to those between cells of the indicated pairs of samples . The median ( Euclidean ) distance over all cells in the first sample was computed for each cell in the second sample using their corresponding 32-dimensional protein level vectors . Then , similarly , the median ( Euclidean ) distance over all cells in the second sample was computed for each cell in the first sample using their corresponding 32-dimensional protein level vectors . The union of these two sets of median distances was used to determine the distribution of median distances between the sample pair . These resulting datasets were visualized in terms of a cumulative distribution function using the stat_ecdf function of the ggplot2 package in R . This section describes in detail how FlowSOM was implemented to cluster the atlas and kNN latent cells , and how this information was used to demonstrate non-random distribution of kNN latent cells among memory CD4+ T cells . For simplicity , we have illustrated the process with one of the four leukapheresis donors ( PID1695 ) , but similar methods were implemented for the other three . The FlowSOM analysis for all four donor specimens revealed a non-random distribution of kNN latent cells among memory CD4+ T cells .

The louder the call , the further the sound travels and the more females he can attract . But making loud sounds is difficult for small animals like insects . To produce sounds , tree crickets rub their wings together and set them into vibration . As the wings vibrate , their motion creates changes in the surrounding air pressure , which is perceived as sound . As the wings move forwards , they compress the air in front of them and thin the air behind them , working much like the membrane of a loudspeaker . However , when the compressed and thinned air meet at the edges of the wings , the sound cancels out . This problem is known as acoustic short-circuiting , and the smaller the wings , the larger this effect and the less efficient the broadcast of sound becomes . Tree crickets overcome acoustic short-circuiting by making baffles , for which they cut a hole near the centre of a leaf . The cricket then sings from inside this hole with its wings flat against the leaf surface , so that the sound has to travel to the leaf edge before short-circuiting . Not all baffles work equally well though , and scientists are interested to know whether tree crickets know how to make the best possible baffle to attract more females . To find out what makes an ideal baffle , Mhatre et al . first measured the wing vibrations and sounds of real tree crickets , and used them to simulate a cricket singing from different baffles . From these tests , three simple rules emerged that led to the best baffle: use the largest available leaf , make a hole the size of the wings , and place it at the centre of the leaf . Mhatre et al . then discovered that the crickets did not make a baffle every time \u2013 only when the leaves were large enough . This suggests that rather than being solely \u2018robotic\u2019 in their behaviour and the use of objects , insects can behave flexibly . When faced with a choice between two leaves , the crickets followed the same three decision rules that the scientists had discovered , and achieved near optimal baffles . Insects are thought to only be able to gradually improve an object or behaviour , but rarely to optimize it . However , the discovery that tree crickets can make optimal acoustic baffles in a single attempt means that we are only beginning to unravel the underappreciated abilities of insects . An enticing next step will be to see whether the creation of baffles could be considered as tool-making .", "source": "Object manufacture in insects is typically inherited , and believed to be highly stereotyped . Optimization , the ability to select the functionally best material and modify it appropriately for a specific function , implies flexibility and is usually thought to be incompatible with inherited behaviour . Here , we show that tree-crickets optimize acoustic baffles , objects that are used to increase the effective loudness of mate-attraction calls . We quantified the acoustic efficiency of all baffles within the naturally feasible design space using finite-element modelling and found that design affects efficiency significantly . We tested the baffle-making behaviour of tree crickets in a series of experimental contexts . We found that given the opportunity , tree crickets optimised baffle acoustics; they selected the best sized object and modified it appropriately to make a near optimal baffle . Surprisingly , optimization could be achieved in a single attempt , and is likely to be achieved through an inherited yet highly accurate behavioural heuristic . \n Animals produce conspicuous intraspecific communication signals whose intensity is maximised through sexual selection . Several insect species , including tree crickets , use sound to advertise for mates . The louder the call , the farther it travels and the more detectable and attractive it is to listening females ( Farris et al . , 1997; Forrest , 1991; Mhatre and Balakrishnan , 2007 ) . Several strategies exist to enhance the radiation of acoustic energy ( Bennet-Clark , 1999 ) , but the principal strategy insects use is to exploit the mechanical resonance either of adapted body parts , such as wings , or tymbal organs ( Mhatre et al . , 2012; Sueur et al . , 2006 ) , or of their immediate environment as mole crickets do with their calling burrow ( Daws et al . , 1996 ) . Tree crickets use a unique and distinct strategy to enhance the reach of their call; they make and use their own acoustic baffles ( Forrest , 1991; Prozesky-Schulze et al . , 1975; Forrest , 1982 ) . Tree crickets , like other crickets , produce sound by rubbing raised forewings together and setting them into resonant vibration ( Mhatre et al . , 2012 ) . The sound that radiates from either side of the vibrating wing , however , is of opposite phase; positive pressure or compression in the direction of the wing\u2019s motion and rarefaction or negative pressure on the other side ( see Video 1 ) . The wing\u2019s sound production capability is thus made inefficient by \u2018acoustic short-circuiting\u2019 , whereby the two opposing sound waves emanating from the wing destructively interfere at its edges , thus reducing the total radiated sound pressure ( Forrest , 1991; Prozesky-Schulze et al . , 1975; Forrest , 1982 ) ( Video 1 ) . This short-circuiting is particularly potent in tree crickets because their wings are small ( ~9 mm in length ) compared to the wavelength of their call ( ~110 mm at 3 . 1 kHz ) . One way to circumvent the limitation is to separate the front and back faces of the sound source ( the resonating wings ) thus precluding deleterious interaction between the two pressure waves . A baffle provides exactly such acoustic isolation ( Video 1 ) . In effect , male tree crickets cut a hole in a leaf to make a baffle . They then place their head and forelegs through the hole and call with their wings parallel to the leaf surface and centred within the hole ( Figure 1A , Video 2 ) . The leaf surface area provides acoustic isolation between the two sides , increasing call loudness ( Forrest , 1991; Prozesky-Schulze et al . , 1975 ) . Given that the only function of the baffle is to prevent acoustic short circuiting , and not to resonate with the call , a tree cricket could use any leaf , or flat surface for this purpose . Here , we show that not all leaves confer equal benefits to sound radiation . Baffle design has a profound effect on radiation efficiency , and tree crickets can select the best leaf to make a near optimal baffle . We show that we can quantitatively predict the relationship between calling effort ( measured as wing vibration velocity ) , baffle design , and the resulting sound using biomechanical and acoustical measurements , and finite element analysis ( FEA ) . Using FEA models , we calculate and test the efficiency of tree crickets calling from different natural baffle designs , accounting for the complex geometries of cricket wings , their self-made baffles , and the leaves crickets chose to call from . \n To characterize calling effort , wing vibrations during calling were measured using scanning laser Doppler vibrometry . Call was recorded simultaneously at a distance of 200 mm ( Figure 1A , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Measurements were made from freely behaving animals who sang when offered pre-made paper baffles ( Figure 1B , C , Materials and methods ) . The sound pressure produced by a vibrating structure is dependent on its space and time averaged velocity . It also depends on the size of the radiator and the wavelength of the sound being produced and is captured by a constant called the radiator resistance ( Hambric and Fahnline , 2007 ) . In tree crickets , the average velocity over the entire wing surface for a fixed period of one second was 0 . 13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 06 m\u00b7s\u22121 , and it produced an average sound pressure level ( SPL ) of 22 . 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011 . 0 mPa ( 60 . 4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 . 1 dB ) . Wing velocity was thus related to sound pressure level by a constant of 0 . 18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 03 Pa/m/s ( all measures are given as mean\u00a0\u00b1SD , n\u00a0=\u00a05 ) . To better understand the acoustic benefit offered by baffles , FEA models were developed of a cricket calling from a baffle identical to that used in the vibrometry experiment ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Vibration measurements served as inputs for FEA models and were used to compute the radiated SPL . Models predicted a bi-lobed acoustic field , consistent with previous acoustic measurements ( Figure 2 ) ( Forrest , 1991; Prozesky-Schulze et al . , 1975; Forrest , 1982 ) . A male calling in free space with average wing velocity was predicted to produce an SPL of 14 . 6 mPa ( 57 . 2 dB at 200 mm ) ( Figure 2A ) , commensurate with field measurements ( Deb and Balakrishnan , 2014 ) . The virtual oval baffle increased SPL at the same distance to 24 . 9 mPa ( 61 . 9 dB ) ( Figure 2B ) , consistent with the actual sound pressures recorded in the experiments ( 22 . 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011 . 0 mPa or 60 . 4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 . 1 dB , n\u00a0=\u00a05 ) . Real baffles , however , vary given that crickets encounter leaves of different sizes and produce dissimilar holes . Hence , baffles are also expected to vary in their capacity to enhance call amplitude . Larger leaves and cricket-size baffle holes are thought to make the best baffles ( Prozesky-Schulze et al . , 1975 ) . Using FEA , we produced a quantitative comparison between different baffle designs using a metric we defined , sound radiation efficiency ( SRE ) . Males are expected to maximize the reach of their mate attraction calls per unit calling effort . Therefore , we defined SRE as the average absolute sound pressure around the calling cricket over a fixed volume normalised to wing vibration amplitude ( expressed in mPa/m\u2219s\u22121 , Materials and methods ) . SRE was calculated only for the range of leaf and hole sizes that encompasses natural variation ( Figure 3A , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This could also be considered an index of male conspicuousness in terms of active acoustic space ( Deb and Balakrishnan , 2014; Mhatre and Balakrishnan , 2006 ) , and all else being equal , the volume of each male\u2019s active space is covariant with SRE . We found that SRE increased with leaf size but became asymptotic for leaves longer than 100 mm , i . e . longer than most natural leaves ( Figure 3A , B ) . Thus , males choosing larger leaves would always make better baffles under natural conditions ( Figure 3A ) . FEA also predicted that a baffle hole of length\u00a0~10 mm , the same as the model wing length ( and the size of a typical male cricket wing ) , was optimal ( Figure 3A ) . The maximum SRE of 386 . 3 mPa/m\u2219s\u22121 was achieved by a baffle made with a leaf 110 . 2 mm long , with a centrally located hole of length 9 . 7 mm . Having constructed a geometrically-resolved map of SRE for feasible baffles , we investigated whether male tree crickets optimized the acoustics of their baffles . SRE with a baffle of any size is higher than unbaffled calling ( Figure 3A , B ) , and the expectation is that males should always baffle given an opportunity . In natural populations observed over three field seasons , however , the probability of finding a baffling male was as low as 26% ( 27 of 105 males observed calling ) and while baffling males tended to be on larger leaves , there was wide variation in leaf size ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Thus baffled-calling is not a stereotyped and obligate calling behaviour; tree cricket males must decide whether to call with or without a baffle . In the wild , large leaves that can make acoustically optimal baffles are extremely rare and search costs are likely to be high ( Figure 3B ) . However , if we eliminate search costs , the propensity to make a baffle may increase with leaf size , a hypothesis that we tested under controlled laboratory conditions . Males were offered leaves of four size classes , one leaf at a time , over four nights . Each night , they could choose either to make a baffle or to call from the edge of the leaf . In this situation , in the absence of search costs , calling males were only balancing the effort expended in making a baffle against the increased SRE . Baffling probability varied depending on the leaf size ( Cochran\u2019s Q: 63 . 9 , df\u00a0=\u00a03 , p<0 . 001 , Figure 3B ) and was significantly different between extra-large and large leaf sizes ( Mc-Nemars \u03c72\u00a0=\u00a04 . 9 , df\u00a0=\u00a01 , p=0 . 02 ) , large and medium leaf sizes ( Mc-Nemars \u03c72\u00a0=\u00a015 . 05 , df\u00a0=\u00a01 , p<0 . 001 ) and medium and small leaf sizes ( Mc-Nemars \u03c72\u00a0=\u00a05 . 14 , df\u00a0=\u00a01 , p=0 . 02 ) . The larger the leaves , the more likely the crickets were to make a baffle ( Figure 3B ) . However , the probability of making a baffle approached 50% only with leaves between 61 and 69 mm long , where SRE increased by 54% . Even with the largest leaves , baffling probability did not exceed 67% , and 33% of the males missed the opportunity to more than double their SRE and thus their active acoustic space ( Figure 3B ) . Next , we tested whether males preferred larger leaves or whether they could also select the best leaf when given a choice . Tree crickets could indeed select the leaves that yielded higher SREs . 19 males were presented with a choice between a small ( 61 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 . 8 mm ) and a large leaf ( 115 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011 . 7 mm ) of their host plant ( Hyptis suaveolens ) . Males always selected the leaves yielding the higher SRE . All males that made a baffle ( 15 of 19 ) used the larger leaf . The holes they made were also acoustically optimal in size ( 10 . 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 . 9 mm , n\u00a0=\u00a015 ) . Thus , given the opportunity males would indeed optimize the SRE of their baffles in terms of both selecting the appropriate materials , i . e . the largest leaf and then modifying it appropriately i . e . cutting a hole of acoustically optimal size ( Figure 3A ) . Males , however , did not make holes at the exact centre of leaves ( Figure 1E ) . We used our FEA to further explore whether eccentric hole positions came at a cost to SRE . An SRE map was constructed by varying hole position across an average leaf in the large size class . This map revealed that SRE was highest at the leaf centre and decreased for eccentric hole positions ( Figure 3C , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Thus , eccentric hole positions come at a cost to SRE . A central-hole baffle on the smaller leaf would have achieved an SRE of 226 . 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020 . 9 mPa/m\u2219s\u22121 . On the large leaf , it would achieve an SRE of 375 . 1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011 . 1 mPa/m\u2219s\u22121 . The radiation efficiency of the real baffles made by the crickets was 332 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030 . 3 mPa/m\u2219s\u22121 i . e . 88 . 6 \u00b1 7 . 6% of the maximum achievable SRE with a skew towards higher efficiencies ( Figure 3D ) ( mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD , range\u00a0=\u00a072 . 8% to 97 . 7% , n\u00a0=\u00a015 all measures ) . Although theoretically optimal , a central hole position is impractical as it cuts through the midrib . This compromises the leaf\u2019s structural rigidity and its main water transport system , causing it to wilt , thus reducing the lifetime of the baffle . Additionally , cutting through the rigid midrib may be mechanically difficult . Indeed , closer observation of baffle holes ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) showed that males never cut through major leaf veins . Surprisingly , most males made only one hole and thus made a baffle in a single attempt , without any progressive trial and error optimization of baffle design . There was , however , one exception , one male made two holes ( Figure 4A ) . The first hole was far from the centre and achieved 72 . 1% of the maximum possible SRE . The male then made another hole closer to the centre which on its own would have achieved 96 . 9% of the maximum SRE . Why did the other males make no effort to boost their call amplitude further ? For instance , mole crickets gradually restructure their burrows to bring burrow resonance closer to call frequency ( Daws et al . , 1996; Bennet-Clark , 1987 ) . Baffles however , are unique and cannot be \u2018edited\u2019 unlike cavities; once a hole has been cut in a leaf , it cannot be erased or repositioned . Only a new hole can be made . Here we show that cutting a new hole entails the risk of making a sub-optimal baffle by reducing current SRE through increased acoustic short-circuiting . We studied the effect of a second hole on SRE by simulating a scenario where an eccentric hole was abandoned and a second , optimally centred hole was constructed . The map depicts at each primary hole position , the percent change in SRE if the male abandoned that position and made a centrally positioned secondary hole ( Figure 4B ) . A second baffle hole would accrue a large increase in SRE only if the primary hole was near a leaf margin and produced very low SRE to begin with ( Figure 4B ) . The only two-holed baffle observed was from a male that made an unusually eccentric primary baffle hole ( highlighted in Figure 4B ) . In this example , making a more central hole improved SRE by 37 . 5% , despite increased acoustic short-circuiting . Interestingly , our simulations predict that the more central the primary hole , the less beneficial a secondary baffle hole becomes and in the central zone of the leaf , a second hole becomes deleterious to SRE ( Figure 4B ) . This is because the second hole would fuse with the primary hole effectively enlarging it to a suboptimal size ( Figure 3A ) . Our observations show that the first holes made by males are already close to the centre; if they made a second central hole , six males would have decreased SRE by 6 . 73 \u00b1 2 . 77% and the other nine males stood to increase SRE but only by 19 . 17 \u00b1 11 . 15% ( Figure 4B ) . This finding supports the notion that crickets position their baffle holes with geometric optimality , but also avoid jeopardising this optimality . This may be why large , and sought-after , leaves only ever have one baffle hole . Near-optimal SREs are achieved by most males at the first baffling attempt ( Figure 3D ) and most attempts at improvement can be predicted as being futile ( Figure 4B ) . \n The question naturally arises as to how tree crickets make acoustically optimal baffles in a single attempt ? In the tree cricket genus Oecanthus , baffle making is common ( Forrest , 1991; Prozesky-Schulze et al . , 1975; Forrest , 1982 ) and expressed by many individuals within the species , suggesting that it is an inherited trait . Thus , the optimization procedure may also be \u2018hard-wired\u2019 , rather than learned and may have developed via sexual selection . We surmise that tree crickets accomplish acoustic optimization using hard-wired heuristics or \u2018rules of thumb\u2019 ( Hutchinson and Gigerenzer , 2005; Cross and Jackson , 2005 ) , which require them to make a series of choices . If a male decides to make a baffle , three simple rules can produce an optimal baffle in a single attempt: ( i ) find the largest available leaf , ( ii ) place the hole as close to the centre of the leaf as possible and ( iii ) cut a hole that can just accommodate wings ( Figure 3 , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . These rules encode sufficient information to capture the shape of SRE landscape within baffle design space into a simple , yet high-accuracy heuristic that always produces the baffle with the highest possible SRE . The accuracy of this heuristic is higher than observed in the progressive optimization procedure observed in mole crickets burrows which always perform just sub-optimally ( Daws et al . , 1996 ) . At 3 kHz , the burrow resonance is always higher than call frequency at 2 . 5 kHz and the actual burrow dimensions do not fit optimal dimensions for sound radiation at either frequency ( Daws et al . , 1996 ) . The explanation for this sub-optimal performance lies in Weber\u2019s law , whereby sensory systems cannot distinguish between small differences in signal amplitude or frequency at high signal amplitudes due to receptor saturation and habituation ( Imaizumi and Pollack , 2001; Imaizumi and Pollack , 1999; Givois and Pollack , 2000 ) . This neurophysiological limitation is likely to be a common driver of suboptimal performance in any method that uses feedback for optimization ( Nachev et al . , 2017 ) . It is possible that the tree crickets learn the SRE landscape , however , we believe that this is unlikely since the opportunity for learning is small due to life-history and time constraints . Tree crickets call only as adults , and for only a few hours each day . Finding and testing each leaf size with every baffle position to find the optimal solution , especially with large leaf sizes being so rare , would require a formidably large number of learning trials and considerable memory . Another possibility is that they can abstract these general rules from a few trials . While we believe that inherited heuristic optimization is a more parsimonious explanation , however , repeating these experiments with na\u00efve males would provide a more definitive answer . Heuristics are , in essence , rational search methods ( McFarland , 1991 ) . When an object or behaviour has different efficiencies depending on a set of parameters , heuristics guide the search for the optimal position in the landscape described by these efficiencies ( McFarland , 1991 ) . Therefore , using a heuristic demonstrates the implicit or explicit knowledge that a behaviour can be accomplished in multiple ways and that each way differs in performance . Therefore heuristics , whether invertebrate , or vertebrate including humans , inherited or learned , imply not only an expectation of performance variability , but also choice and behavioural flexibility . One context in which this may be important is tool use; the conventional view is that invertebrates generally inherit tool use behaviour ( Hunt et al . , 2013 ) and hence have highly stereotyped tool use , whereas vertebrates inherit a propensity to \u2018innovate\u2019 tool behaviour and hence have flexible tool use ( Shettleworth , 2009 , 2010 ) . Inflexible or stereotyped tool use implies that optimization would not be possible for any invertebrate tool-users . It is\u00a0suggested that baffles may be tools or borderline tools ( Bentley-Condit and Smith , 2010; Pierce , 1986; Crain et al . , 2013 ) , therefore baffle optimization suggests that inherited mechanisms such as heuristics may enable flexibility and even optimization in invertebrate tool use . Flexible tool use has indeed already been observed in invertebrates , first in cephalopods ( Finn et al . , 2009 ) and more recently , from bees ( Loukola et al . , 2017; Alem et al . , 2016 ) . Bees have a large capacity for learning , which enables significant behavioural flexibility , and it has now been shown that bees can be taught to use tools . They can even improve upon the tool use demonstrated to them ( Loukola et al . , 2017; Alem et al . , 2016 ) . Indeed , we argue that the behavioural flexibility that enables bees to improve upon demonstrated tool use emerges from a heuristic strategy . Bumble bees were trained to roll a ball into a specific position to gain a reward . The bees spontaneously used the ball nearest to the target even when they had been trained on a different ball ( Loukola et al . , 2017 ) , an excellent example of the well-known greedy heuristic ( Cormen et al . , 2009 ) in which the nearest solution is the most preferred . Indeed , tree cricket behaviour shows that even inherited heuristic mechanisms may enable flexibility and even optimization , prompting a re-examination of invertebrate tool use . In summary , tree cricket males that call from the edge of leaves tend to have low efficiencies ( 94\u2013171 mPa/m\u2219s\u22121 depending on leaf size ) and those that make baffles can achieve much higher efficiencies ( 91\u2013386 mPa/m\u2219s\u22121 over same size range ) . Thus , by finding the largest leaf and making a near optimal baffle , a male tree cricket can increase his active acoustic area by as much as four times ( 12 dB ) , greatly increasing his chances of attracting a mate . The increase in call amplitude that baffling confers can work in two ways . Baffling can either add to the existing variability , broadening the distribution of male call amplitudes or it can function as a compensatory mechanism: males unable to call loudly may make a baffle instead . Behavioural experiments show that despite the advantage baffles confer , only a few animals choose to make a baffle under natural conditions . Non-host plants with larger leaves are available to the tree crickets , yet are rarely used . The rarity of baffling suggests that manufacturing a baffle may be a costly activity ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . In contrast , all mole cricket males stereotypically make acoustic burrow chambers that resonate and boost call amplitude ( Hill et al . , 2006; Hill , 1999 ) . The low incidence of baffling and high variability in baffle design observed in natural baffling behaviour ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) are quite distinct . Baffling may be used to garner even higher mate-attraction benefits on males whose high quality or condition already allows them to make larger energetic investments . Thus , baffle making may represent a unique system in which \u2018good\u2019 males use an acoustically optimized object to further enhance their mate-attraction signal . Another enticing possibility is that baffle-making may have evolved as an alternative strategy allowing smaller males , or those in poorer condition , to sound bigger or louder than they actually are . \n Vibration velocities from the forewings of freely calling tree cricket ( Oecanthus henryi ) males calling from baffles were measured using a micro-scanning laser Doppler vibrometer ( Polytec , PSV-400 , Waldbronn , Germany ) with a Polytec PSV-I-400 scanning head fitted with a close-up attachment , and digitized using the Polytec Scanning Vibrometer software ( version 8 . 8 , Polytec Gmbh , Waldbronn , Germany ) through a data acquisition board ( National Instruments , PCI-6110 , Austin , Texas , USA ) . Acoustic measurements were made simultaneously using two calibrated 1/8th inch precision pressure microphones ( Br\u00fcel and Kj\u00e6r , 4138 , [frequency range 6 Hz to 140 kHz] , Naerum , Denmark ) and preamplifier ( Br\u00fcel and Kj\u00e6r , 2633 , Naerum , Denmark ) . All data were collected at a sampling frequency of 128 kHz for 1 . 024 s . The microphones have a flat response in the measured frequency range . All experiments were carried out on a vibration isolation table ( Technical Manufacturing Corp , 784-443-12R , Peabody , Massachusetts , USA ) . The experimental set-up ( Figure 1E , D ) allowed the calling cricket to be oriented such that the upraised wings were normal to the path of the laser beam . The two microphones were placed coaxially \u2248 20 mm below the path of the laser beam , at a distance of\u00a0\u00b1200 mm from the center of the turn-table , hence from the position of the calling male . The laser was aligned using a video feed and it could then be remotely positioned by the vibrometer software across a grid of points placed over the wings of the calling insect . An average of 245 measurement points across the wing surface were used per animal leading to an average scan duration of just over 4 min . Paper baffles ( made using white 80 g/m2 paper ) were used in the study . These premade baffles were oval in shape and had a length of 68 . 6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 . 6 mm and width of 40 . 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 . 2 mm on average ( n\u00a0=\u00a05 ) and the holes were 17 . 4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 . 9 mm in length and 11 . 4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 . 9 mm in width ( n\u00a0=\u00a05 ) . During calling , the peak baffle surface displacements were considerably lower ( 1/600th ) than the wings leading us to conclude that the baffles did not act as significant secondary acoustic radiators . The sound pressure radiating from a vibrating body depends on the space-time average of the body\u2019s vibration velocity ( Hambric and Fahnline , 2007 ) . The peak value , which we also report in the main paper , is taken from the point of maximum deflection of the wing , as shown in Figure 1A . The rest of the wing does not move with this magnitude . The resulting sound is a consequence of the whole wings movement not just of this one point . If we used the peak value alone , the magnitude of wing vibration would be over-estimated . Taking an average in space resolves this issue . Since pressure is conventionally measured after integration over a fixed time period for amplitude-modulated signals , to be comparable , we also performed a time average of the vibration velocity . Hence we calculated the space-time average of the velocity in the z-direction ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) from all the measurement points placed over the entire surface of the wing during calling . Finite element analysis ( FEA ) models of a cricket calling in free space or on different baffles were created to investigate pressures produced by vibrating cricket wings . FEA modeling was carried out using a commercial package ( COMSOL 4 . 3 , Burlington , Massachusetts , USA ) . The acoustics module was used implementing harmonic analysis with the Helmholtz equation as the governing equation . Oecanthus henryi males are observed to call and manufacture baffles from Hyptis suaveolens leaves in the wild . To better understand their interactions with the leaves , we performed three independent studies ."}

People affected by the disease find that their muscles become progressively weaker , and may go on to develop a bone disorder and a form of dementia . The disease is caused by mutations in a gene that codes for Valosin-Containing Protein ( VCP ) \u2013 a protein that carries out many different roles in cells . Mutated forms of VCP predominantly affect tissues and organs that need a lot of energy , such as the muscles and the brain . Within cells , structures called mitochondria generate energy . A number of studies suggest that the mitochondria in cells taken from individuals with IBMPFD do not generate energy properly . However , it is not known how mutant VCP disrupts mitochondria or how this leads to disease . Fruit flies and humans have similar versions of the gene that produces VCP . Studying flies that have mutations that affect the gene can therefore help researchers to understand how these mutations might affect humans . Zhang et al . have now engineered fruit flies whose muscle cells made a mutant form of VCP . These flies showed many of the symptoms of IBMPFD ( such as the death of muscle cells ) . In addition , the mitochondria in the muscle cells were smaller and more fragmented than normal . This led Zhang et al . to look at a protein called Mitofusin that controls how mitochondria fuse . VCP normally degrades Mitofusin; the mutant form of VCP caused Mitofusin to degrade excessively . This resulted in mitochondria experiencing reduced levels of fusion , leading to cell malfunction and death . In further experiments , Zhang et al . treated the disease-modeled flies and cells from human patients with IBMPFD with inhibitor drugs that prevent the activity of VCP . This treatment reversed the defects that affected the mitochondria and prevented the death of muscle cells . This opens up the possibility of using VCP inhibitors \u2013 which are already being investigated in clinical trials as a treatment for cancer \u2013 as drugs to treat IBMPFD .", "source": "Missense mutations of valosin-containing protein ( VCP ) cause an autosomal dominant disease known as inclusion body myopathy , Paget disease with frontotemporal dementia ( IBMPFD ) and other neurodegenerative disorders . The pathological mechanism of IBMPFD is not clear and there is no treatment . We show that endogenous VCP negatively regulates Mitofusin , which is required for outer mitochondrial membrane fusion . Because 90% of IBMPFD patients have myopathy , we generated an in vivo IBMPFD model in adult Drosophila muscle , which recapitulates disease pathologies . We show that common VCP disease mutants act as hyperactive alleles with respect to regulation of Mitofusin . Importantly , VCP inhibitors suppress mitochondrial defects , muscle tissue damage and cell death associated with IBMPFD models in Drosophila . These inhibitors also suppress mitochondrial fusion and respiratory defects in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts . These results suggest that VCP disease mutants cause IBMPFD through a gain-of-function mechanism , and that VCP inhibitors have therapeutic value . \n IBMPFD is an autosomal dominant disease that afflicts multiple body systems ( Kimonis et al . , 2008a ) . 90% of IBMPFD patients display skeletal muscle weakness ( myopathy ) , the primary and earliest symptom of IBMPFD ( Weihl et al . , 2009 ) . With progression of the disease , 50% of patients will develop Paget\u2019s disease of bone , affecting the skull , spine , hips and long bones of all four limbs . One-third of the patients will also develop frontotemporal dementia ( Weihl et al . , 2009; Kimonis et al . , 2008b ) . Single missense mutations of p97/cdc48/Valosin-containing protein ( VCP ) cause fully penetrant IBMPFD ( Watts et al . , 2004 ) . VCP mutations are also associated with 1\u20132% of cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , familial hereditary spastic paraplegia ( HSP ) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2 ( CMT2 ) disease ( Abramzon et al . , 2012; de Bot et al . , 2012; Gonzalez et al . , 2014 ) . VCP encodes a highly conserved and abundant AAA+ ATPase which participates in multiple cellular processes ( Meyer et al . , 2012 ) . Human p97/VCP and its Drosophila homologue have 85% identity and 93% similarity in protein sequence . VCP has three major domains: the regulatory N domain , and the D1 and D2 ATPase domains . VCP hexameric rings utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to promote protein and RNA homeostasis , often by directly or indirectly modifying the fate of ubiquitin-labeled proteins ( Meyer et al . , 2012 ) . VCP functions in multiple contexts that include protein quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum ( Ye et al . , 2001; Shih and Hsueh , 2016 ) , chromatin modification ( Puumalainen et al . , 2014; Dobrynin et al . , 2011; Vaz et al . , 2013 ) , endolysosomal sorting ( Ritz et al . , 2011 ) , membrane fusion ( Zhang et al . , 2014 ) , autophagosome/lyosome function ( Ju et al . , 2009; Johnson et al . , 2015 ) , ER protein translocation ( DeLaBarre et al . , 2006; Weihl et al . , 2006 ) , formation of stress granules ( Buchan et al . , 2013 ) and ciliogenesis ( Raman et al . , 2015 ) . VCP interacts with a number of co-factors to regulate these processes ( Meyer and Weihl , 2014; Meyer et al . , 2012 ) , making it challenging to identify the molecular basis of phenotypes associated with disease mutations . Disease-causing , single missense mutations of VCP are mainly located in the N-terminal half of the protein , either in the N domain or the D1 domain . Among them , the R155H mutation is the most frequently identified in IBMPFD patients , while the A232E mutation is associated with the most severe clinical manifestation ( Kimonis et al . , 2008a; Ritson et al . , 2010 ) . In vitro assays show that disease mutants have enhanced ATPase activity ( Weihl et al . , 2006; Zhang et al . , 2015; Niwa et al . , 2012; Manno et al . , 2010; Tang and Xia , 2013 ) . However , because VCP assembles as a hexamer , it is controversial whether disease mutants with increased ATPase activity cause disease through a dominant-active ( Chang et al . , 2011 ) or dominant-negative mechanism ( Ritz et al . , 2011; Ju et al . , 2009; Kim et al . , 2013; Bartolome et al . , 2013; Kimura et al . , 2013 ) . VCP disease mutants predominantly affect organs that have a high level of energy expenditure , such as brain and muscle . Mitochondria provide the bulk of the ATP to these tissues through oxidative phosphorylation , and mitochondrial functional defects , including mitochondrial uncoupling and decreased ATP production , are observed in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts ( Bartolome et al . , 2013; Nalbandian et al . , 2015a ) . Abnormal mitochondria are also observed in transgenic VCP disease mutant R155H mice as well as VCP R155H knock-in mice ( Custer et al . , 2010; Nalbandian et al . , 2012 ) . These observations suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is important for the pathogenesis of IBMPFD , but the mechanism by which VCP mutation alters mitochondrial function is not clear . Mitochondrial morphology is controlled by dynamic cycles of fusion , controlled by Mitofusin ( Mfn ) , and fission , regulated by DRP1 ( Chan , 2012 ) . Recent studies have uncovered the\u00a0roles of mitochondria fusion and fission defects in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative disorders ( Davies et al . , 2007; Chen et al . , 2003; Wakabayashi et al . , 2009 ) , particularly Parkinson's disease , the second most common neurodegenerative disorder ( Guo , 2012; Pickrell and Youle , 2015;\u00a0Deng et al . , 2008; Yang et al . , 2008;\u00a0Poole et al . , 2008 , 2010; Park et al . , 2009 ) . In mammals , homologous proteins Mitofusin 1 and 2 ( Mfn1 and Mfn2 ) mediate mitochondrial outer membrane fusion , with loss of function of Mfn 1 and 2 resulting in fragmented mitochondria and multiple defects in mitochondrial function ( Chen et al . , 2003b ) . In Hela cells , VCP promotes Mfn 1 degradation ( Xu et al . , 2011 ) . VCP also mediates Mfn\u00a01\u00a0and\u00a02 degradation when mitophagy is stimulated in mammalian cells , and overexpression of VCP in Drosophila leads to\u00a0downregulation of a tagged Mfn-transgene ( Kim et al . , 2013; Kimura et al . , 2013 ) . These observations led us to investigate the mitochondrial basis and molecular mechanisms for VCP disease mutants function using both Drosophila and IBMPFD patient cell models . As IBMPFD show the highest penetrance in muscle , with 90% of patients manifesting phenotypes in this tissue , we generated Drosophila models of IBMPFD in muscle , which recapitulate disease pathologies . We provide evidence in both Drosophila and human patient cells that VCP disease mutants have an enhanced ability to promote Mfn degradation , loss of which is associated with defects in mitochondrial fusion and physiology . Consistent with the hypothesis that VCP disease phenotypes are due to increased activity on substrates , we find that VCP ATPase activity inhibitors such as NMS-873 and ML240 can significantly rescue mitochondrial defects , disrupted muscle integrity and muscle cell death in vivo in Drosophila , and mitochondrial fusion and respiration defects in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts . \n Since VCP disease mutants have dramatic muscle phenotypes in humans and mouse models , and these are associated with defects in mitochondrial structure and function , we first examined the consequences of manipulating VCP levels . The Drosophila adult indirect flight muscle ( IFM ) is a non-essential , post-mitotic , and energy-intense tissue containing a high density of mitochondria . It also shows strong and consistent phenotypes in response to altered expression of genes required for mitochondrial fusion , fission and quality control ( Clark et al . , 2006;\u00a0Deng et al . , 2008;\u00a0Yang et al . , 2008; Poole et al . , 2008; Park et al . , 2009; Poole et al . , 2010;\u00a0Yun et al . , 2014 ) . Using the UAS-Gal4 system ( Brand and Perrimon , 1993 ) , we expressed VCP under the control of an IFM promoter derived from the flightin gene we previously generated ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) . While expression of VCP under the control of the pan-muscle Gal4 drivers 24B-Gal4 or Mef2-Gal4 resulted in 100% adult lethality , expression of wildtype VCP under IFM control , which provides a pulse of expression in late pupal stages and early adulthood , gave rise to viable flies with intact and healthy muscle following adult eclosion . We utilized mitochondrially targeted GFP ( mitoGFP ) as a mitochondrial marker , as well as transmission electron microscopy ( EM ) at the ultrastructual levels for enhanced resolution particularly for cristae morphology . In 2-day-old flies , expression of VCP results in muscle with small mitochondria with intact cristae ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B\u2019 ) . Similar phenotypes are also observed in muscle from 6-day-old VCP-expressing flies ( Figure 1A\u2013B\u2019\u2019 ) . Conversely , expression of UAS-VCP RNAi under IFM control ( VCP RNAi flies ) results in mitochondria with an elongated phenotype ( Figure 1C\u2013C\u2019\u2019 , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C and C\u2019 ) . Two independent VCP RNAi lines were utilized and both showed significant knockdown ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 006 To explore the generality of VCP\u2019s ability to regulate mitochondrial morphology we also examined mitochondrial morphology phenotypes of a vcp loss-of-function mutation . vcp null mutants in Drosophila are embryonic lethal ( Ruden et al . , 2000 ) . The indirect flight muscle is a cellular syncytium and therefore cannot be used for mosaic analysis . As an alternative , we focused on the Drosophila female germline , in which a vcp loss-of-function mutant can be monitored in individual nurse\u00a0cells , which are relatively large and offer great resolution for examining mitochondrial morphology . vcpK15502 is a strong loss-of-function allele that has a P element insertion at the 5\u2019-UTR of Drosophila VCP gene ( Chang et al . , 2011; Ruden et al . , 2000 ) and has been used to generate vcp loss-of-function clones in imaginal discs ( Zhang et al . , 2013 ) . The Drosophila ovary consists of numerous developing egg chambers . Each egg chamber develops from stage 1 to stage 14 and has three types of cells: follicle cells , nurse cells and the oocyte ( Frydman and Spradling , 2001 ) . The germline complement of each egg chamber ( 15 nurse cells and the oocyte ) derives from four sequential divisions of a single daughter of a stem cell . We utilized the FLP/FRT system ( Theodosiou and Xu , 1998 ) to create mitotic recombinants in which nurse cells were either wildtype ( +/+ ) , heterozygous ( vcpK15502/+ ) or homozygous ( vcpK15502/vcpK15502 ) for the vcp loss-of-function mutation ( Figure 1D ) . In this system wildtype and heterozygous vcp loss-of-function mutant cells carry 2 or 1 copies of ubi-mRFP . NLS ( RFP ) respectively , whereas the homozygous vcp mutant cells are RFP negative ( Figure 1E ) . Anti-ATP5A antibody is used to visualize mitochondrial morphology in nurse cells ( Figure 1E\u2019 ) . Mitochondria in wildtype and heterozygous vcp mutant cells have a punctate morphology ( Figure 1F and G ) . In contrast , in homozygous vcp loss-of-function mutants mitochondria are more tubular and clumped ( Figure 1H and I ) . Together , these results suggest that endogenous VCP negatively regulates mitochondrial fusion or positively regulates fission . Next , we investigated how vcp loss-of-function leads to elongated mitochondria . First , we examined the expression levels of Mfn in the female germline , using mosaic analysis , as above . We used a tagged genomic rescue transgene ( pCasper-Mfn-eGFP , a transgene construct with a GFP tagged Mfn under the control of its endogenous promoter , a kind gift from Dr . CK Yao ) to monitor the endogenous Mfn level as the existing anti-Mfn antibody lacked sufficient sensitivity . As expected , the genomic rescue Mfn-eGFP signal colocalizes with the mitochondria marker ATP5A in the nurse cells ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A ) . This signal is eliminated following Mfn RNAi , indicating that genomic rescue Mfn-eGFP is a reliable marker for endogenous Mfn ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B ) . In each egg chamber , vcp loss-of-function cells are adjacent to wildtype cells , providing an ideal opportunity to unambigously compare the levels of Mfn . As shown in Figure 1J\u2013J\u2019\u2019 , nurse cells homozygous for a vcp loss-of-function mutant have greatly increased Mfn levels compared to wildtype and heterozygous vcp loss-of-function cells . The findings that endogenous VCP regulates Mfn in vivo are unexpected and important , as VCP is a highly abundant cytosolic protein with many targets and VCP does not show appreciable localization to mitochondria in unstressed cells . Second , we examined whether alteration of vcp can regulate Mfn levels in tissue lysate . Overexpression of wildtype VCP ( VCP OE ) in the flight muscle resulted in a decrease in endogenous Mfn levels ( Figure 2A ) . VCP overexpression also caused a decrease in the levels of Mfn when Mfn was overexpressed ( Mfn OE ) using the IFM promoter , suggesting that VCP regulates Mfn post transcriptionally ( Figure 2A ) . Conversely , VCP RNAi resulted in an increase in endogenous Mfn levels in a wildtype background , and an increase in total Mfn levels in the presence of Mfn OE ( Figure 2B ) . In contrast , VCP overexpression does not alter the levels of pro-fission protein DRP1 ( Figure 2C ) . In addition , VCP\u2019s regulation of Mfn is specific and not part of a general mitophagy response since the levels of other mitochondrial proteins , such\u00a0as\u00a0the outer membrane protein Porin , the inner membrane protein NDUSF3 , and the matrix protein MnSOD , are not altered ( Figure 2D ) . To explore the possibility that Mfn is a direct target for VCP , we asked if Mfn could physically interact with VCP in immunoprecipitation assays from S2 cells . Indeed , full length VCP strongly interacts with Mfn ( Figure 2E ) . This is consistent with previous findings ( Kim et al . , 2013 ) . VCP has been shown to interact with substrate through the D1 ATPase domain , with the presence of the N domain being essential for the interaction ( Meyer et al . , 2012 ) . As shown in\u00a0Figure 2E , this is also the case with\u00a0the VCP-Mfn interaction . When the N domain of VCP is deleted , the strength of VCP-Mfn interaction is decreased , and it is undetectable when N and D1 are both deleted . In contrast , removal of the D2 domain has no effect on interaction between VCP and Mfn . Interestingly , Mfn levels in the input blot are decreased under conditions when VCP and Mfn interact , but not under conditions in which interactions are not observed , consistent with the hypothesis that direct interaction between VCP and Mfn is required for Mfn degradation . Together , these observations suggest that Mfn is a specific , direct target of VCP . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 007Figure 2 . Mfn is a specific target of VCP . ( A ) In fly thoraxes , VCP OE in wildtype ( IFM-Gal4 control ) and Mfn OE background results in a significant decrease in Mfn levels . Hsp60 was used as a mitochondria control; Actin was used as a\u00a0loading control .

We and others\u00a0have shown that PINK1 and Parkin function in the same pathway , with PINK1 positively regulating Parkin to control mitochondrial integrity and quality control in Drosophila ( Clark et al . , 2006;\u00a0Yang et al . , 2006; Park et al . , 2006 ) . Importantly , levels of Mfn are significantly increased in PINK1 and parkin null mutants and downregulation of Mfn protein levels suppresses phenotypes in both mutants ( Deng et al . , 2008;\u00a0Yang et al . , 2008; Park et al . , 2009;\u00a0Yu et al . , 2011 ) . The results presented above suggest that expression of VCP , by decreasing the level of Mfn , could also suppress PINK1/parkin phenotypes . Kim et al . have argued that VCP expression suppresses PINK1 , but not parkin loss-of-function phenotypes . This , along with their observation that VCP levels at mitochondria increased following expression of Parkin in the presence of CCCP , suggested a model in which VCP action on mitochondria requires recruitment by Parkin ( Kim et al . , 2013 ) . Because the EDTP-Gal4 driver used in these earlier experiments does not express at significant levels in flight muscle ( Seroude et al . , 2002 ) ( Figure 3J , see GFP signals ) , we reexamined this issue . We expressed VCP in the flight muscle of PINK1 and parkin mutants . As previously shown ( Yang et al . , 2006; Clark et al . , 2006; Park et al . , 2006 ) , PINK1 and parkin null mutants show mitochondrial defects and tissue disintegration with vacuolation in muscle ( Figure 3A\u2013B\u2019\u2019 and D\u2013D\u2019\u2019 ) . At the ultrastructural level , PINK1 and parkin mutants display swollen mitochondria with a\u00a0broken cristae ( Figure 3A\u2019\u2019\u2019 , B\u2019\u2019\u2019 and D\u2019\u2019\u2019 ) . VCP OE completely suppressed tissue damage and mitochondrial defects ( Figure 3C\u2013C\u2019\u2019\u2019 and E\u2013E\u2019\u2019\u2019 ) . The thorax indentation phenotype in PINK1/parkin mutants is also completely suppressed by VCP overexpression under the control of the IFM-Gal4 driver , but not the EDTP-Gal4 driver ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The suppression observed by Kim , et al . is probably due to non-disjunction of the PINK1 null flies . As predicted for a mechanism of VCP action that occurs through regulation of Mfn , VCP OE significantly reduced the accumulation of Mfn normally observed in both mutants ( Figure 3F ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 008Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 009 To further substantiate the finding that overexpression of VCP suppresses parkin null mutants , we also examined VCP\u2019s ability to suppress mitochondrial phenotypes associated with loss of both parkin and mul1 . MUL1 ( MULAN/MAPL ) is a RING-containing E3 ligase that acts as a negative regulator of Mfn in both Drosophila and mammals ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) . When overexpressed , it suppresses PINK1 and parkin null mutant phenotypes by degrading Mfn , while loss of mul1 leads to increased levels of Mfn . Thus , parkin mul1 double null mutants have strikingly more severe mitochondrial phenotypes than those observed in flies lacking parkin alone ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) . Remarkably , expression of VCP resulted in a dramatic rescue of mitochondrial morphology due to lack of both parkin and mul1 ( Figure 3G\u2013I\u2019 ) . Together , these results suggest that VCP-dependent suppression of PINK1 null , parkin null and parkin mul1 double phenotypes occurs through downregulaton of Mfn levels ( Figure 3K ) . Together , our observations argue that VCP regulates Mfn levels under non-stress conditions . They also show that VCP-dependent regulation of Mfn does not require PINK1 or Parkin . However , these results do not exclude the possibility that Parkin activation further promotes VCP-dependent Mfn degradation under some situations . To explore the basis of myopathy induced by VCP disease mutants we sought to create a model of IBMPFD in Drosophila muscle , as 90% of the IBMPFD patients show muscle phenotypes . Since VCP disease mutations are autosomal dominant , we characterized the consequences of disease mutant overexpression . The pathologies observed in IBMPFD patient muscle , and in muscle from VCP disease mutant transgenic and mouse knock-in models , include muscle cell death , changes in mitochondrial morphology , damaged tissue integrity , TAR DNA-binding protein 43 ( TDP43 ) mislocalization to the cytosol , and formation of autophagic marker p62 and ubiquitin aggregates , signs of multisystem proteinopathy ( Ju et al . , 2009; Ritson et al . , 2010; Nalbandian et al . , 2012; Ritz et al . , 2011; Nalbandian et al . , 2015b; Weihl , 2011; Ahmed et al . , 2016 ) . Previous studies of VCP disease mutants in Drosophila muscle showed effects on tissue integrity and mitochondria cristae structure ( Chang et al . , 2011; Kim et al . , 2013 ) , but not other pathologies . We thus investigated the pathologies due to mutant VCP expression . We focused on expression of VCP R152H and A229E ( corresponding to Human VCP R155H and A232E , hereafter referred to as VCP RH and VCP AE ) , as they are the most frequent and the most severe mutations identified , respectively ( Figure 4A ) . Anti-VCP antibody blotting shows that VCP WT , VCP RH and VCP AE are expressed at comparable level in the fly's thorax ( Figure 4B ) . In wildtype flies , flies with IFM-Gal4 insertion , and flies with VCP WT expression , the muscle structure was healthy and intact 6 days after eclosion . No cell death was observed and mitochondria were densely packed and contained high levels of MitoGFP ( Figure 4C , D and D\u2019 ) . Muscles also displayed a well-aligned myofibril structure ( Figure 4E and E\u2019 ) . Together these observations indicate that increased expression of VCP is not overtly toxic . In contrast , muscle from flies expressing VCP RH or VCP AE under IFM-Gal4 control ( thereafter called VCP RH or VCP AE flies ) showed extensive cell death ( 97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 . 6% and 95 . 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 . 1% muscle are TUNEL-positive ) , defective MitoGFP signals ( Figure 4D\u2019\u2019 and D\u2019\u2019\u2019 ) , and severely disrupted muscle integrity ( Figure 4E\u2019\u2019 and E\u2019\u2019\u2019 ) . In addition , while in wildtype and VCP WT flies TDP43 was found in IFM nuclear and sarcoplasmic compartments , IFMs from VCP RH and AE flies showed a decrease in the intensity of the nuclear signal , and an increase in the intensity of staining associated with puncta in the sarcoplasmic area ( Figure 4C , F\u2013F\u2019\u2019\u2019 ) . Muscle from VCP RH and AE flies also contained large aggregates of anti-p62 and anti-ubiquitin staining . These were not observed in wildtype or VCP WT flies ( Figure 4G\u2013H\u2019\u2019\u2019 ) . Importantly , the pathologies observed in flight muscle at day 6 post eclosion were not present at day 2 ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , suggesting the degenerative nature of the pathology , as with the human disease and mouse models ( Kimonis et al . , 2008a; Custer et al . , 2010; Nalbandian et al . , 2012 ) . Together , these observations indicate that IFM-specific expression of VCP RH and AE recapitulates a broad spectrum of IBMPFD disease pathologies and forms the strong basis for further investigation of disease mechanisms and treatment studies . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 010Figure 4 .

In VCP RH and AE muscle , however , mitochondria are smaller in size , and more fragmented than in VCP WT flies . In addition , they also have severe ultrastructural defects under EM studies with a broken\u00a0cristae ( Figure 5C\u2013D\u2019 ) . This phenotype is similar to that of flies with a muscle-specific Mfn knock down ( Figure 5E and E\u2019 ) ( Deng et al . , 2008 ) . Muscle from 2-day-old\u00a0VCP RH and VCP AE flies also\u00a0show similar phenotypes to Mfn knock down ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 012Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 015 The strong mitochondrial phenotypes observed in VCP RH or VCP AE predicts that expression of VCP RH or VCP AE may result in a greater decrease in Mfn levels as compared with the\u00a0expression of VCP WT . This is indeed what we observed ( Figure 5F ) . This raises the possibility that VCP RH and AE are hyperactive alleles . To further substantiate these findings , we compared the Mfn levels in flies expressing VCP E2Q , a well-established ATPase defective mutant containing two mutations ( fly or human residues by number E305Q and E578Q ) that abolish the ATPase activity of the D1 and D2 domains . Expression of E2Q did not significantly change the Mfn levels ( Figure 5F ) . As a control , the expression of any of the above forms of VCP did not alter expression levels of mitochondrial matrix\u00a0protein Hsp60 ( Figure 5F ) . These results suggest that VCP disease mutants are hyperactive with respect to promoting downregulation of Mfn levels . Based on these observations , we hypothesized that VCP disease mutants should also rescue mitochondrial phenotypes in parkin and parkin mul1 double mutants . As shown in Figure 5G\u2013J , expression of VCP RH and AE mutants , but not VCP E2Q or VCP RNAi , robustly restored mitochondrial structure , as indicated by MitoGFP fluorescence , in the parkin null mutant ( Figure 5K and L ) . Moreover , corresponding to the mitochondrial phenotypes , the accumulation of Mfn in parkin mutants was significantly reduced in the presence of VCP WT , RH and AE , with VCP RH and AE causing greater decreases in Mfn levels than VCP WT ( Figure 5S ) . In addition , VCP RH and AE expression also robustly rescued the mitochondrial defects in the parkin mul1 double null mutants , but an\u00a0expression of VCP E2Q or VCP RNAi did not ( Figure 5M\u2013R ) . Taken together , these results indicate that VCP RH and AE disease mutants do not behave as ATPase defective or loss-of-function mutants , and instead are hyperactive with respect to regulation of Mfn . A prediction from our finding that Mfn downregulation is important for IBMPFD pathology is that downregulation of Mfn should result in phenotypes similar to those observed with an expression of VCP disease mutants . Indeed , mfn muscle-specific knockdown flies have fragmented mitochondria ( Figure 4I\u2013I\u2019 ) , TDP43 mislocalization ( Figure 4J\u2013J\u2019 ) , vacuole formation ( Figure 4K\u2013K\u2019 ) , p62 and ubiquitin accumulation ( Figure 4L\u2013L\u2019 and M\u2013M\u2019 ) , as with the VCP disease mutants . Next we asked if mfn overexpression could rescue the phenotypes due to VCP RH and AE . Since mfn overexpression results in significant mitochondrial phenotypes , tissue disintegration and cell death on its own ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) , we are unable to address this question completely due to a technical limitation . We were , however , able to bring about a mild increase in Mfn levels through addition of 2 copies of an mfn genomic rescue transgene in the background of VCP RH and AE expressing flies . Interestingly , this resulted in a suppression of the mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae phenotypes in 2-day-old VCP RH and AE flies ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) but not the pathology observed in VCP RH and AE fly muscles at 6 days ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Together , our data suggest that downregulation of Mfn is an important contributor to IBMPFD muscle pathology . Next , we extended our studies in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts . We focused our studies on VCPR155H/+ cells ( thereafter called RH cells ) , as fibroblasts harboring the VCPA232E/+ mutation are not available . First , we characterized mitochondrial respiration in control and immortalized patient fibroblasts . As shown in Figure 6A , the basal level Oxygen Consumption Rate ( OCR ) in the VCP RH patient cells is slightly decreased compared to the healthy control , suggesting that baseline mitochondrial respiratory chain function is compromised in patient cells . Maximum OCR , measured in the presence of the uncoupler FCCP , is significantly decreased in VCP RH IBMPFD patient cells . The spare OCR , which is calculated by subtracting the basal OCR from the maximum OCR , provides a measure of reserve mitochondrial capacity for ATP generation . The spare OCR in IBMPFD patient cells is significantly decreased as compared with controls . Others have recently reported similar observations ( Nalbandian et al . , 2015a ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 016Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 016 Disruption of mitochondrial fusion can result in defects in respiration similar to those observed in patient cells ( Chen et al . , 2003b ) . Mfn 1 and 2 levels in VCP RH cells were reduced to 0 . 66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 14 and 0 . 60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 14 respectively , as compared with age and gender matched healthy control cells ( set as 1 , Figure 6B ) . To explore the functional significance of this decrease , we carried out mitochondrial fusion assays using fibroblasts from healthy controls and patients . Both cell populations were transfected with a plasmid encoding a mitochondrial matrix targeted , photoactivated GFP ( PA-GFP ) . Following photoactivation of GFP within a region of the cell , the GFP fluorescence signal spreads and the intensity decreases as these mitochondria fuse with non-activated neighboring mitochondria . Thus , in this assay an increased rate of fluorescence loss corresponds to increased mitochondrial fusion activity ( Mishra et al . , 2014a ) . In control cells , PA-GFP gradually decreases after photoactivation; in the VCP RH IBMPFD patient cells , the GFP signal decrease is significantly delayed ( Figure 6C\u2013D\u2019 , E ) . These data suggest that the VCP RH mutation results in a decrease in Mfn 1 and 2 levels that lead to impaired mitochondrial fusion . In addition , the VCP mutant impairs both basal and maximal mitochondrial respiratory function . It has been controversial in the field whether VCP disease mutants with increased ATPase activity behave as dominant-active or dominant-negative mutants . Some studies show that VCP RH and AE , with enhanced ATPase activity ( Weihl et al . , 2006; Zhang et al . , 2015; Niwa et al . , 2012; Manno et al . , 2010; Tang and Xia , 2013 ) , result in hyperactivity in animal disease models ( Chang et al . , 2011 ) . However , other cell-based studies suggest they behave in a dominant negative fashion ( Ritz et al . , 2011; Ju et al . , 2009; Kim et al . , 2013; Bartolome et al . , 2013; Kimura et al . , 2013 ) . Understanding how VCP disease mutants behave is critical for understanding the disease process and finding possible therapies . We hypothesize that if an\u00a0abnormally enhanced ATPase activity causes pathology , disease severity should ameliorate if ATPase activity is decreased through the use of VCP ATPase inhibitors . To test this hypothesis , we characterized the effects of VCP inhibitors in vivo . Multiple VCP ATPase activity inhibitors have recently been described ( Chapman et al . , 2015 ) . NMS-873 , 3-[3-Cyclopentylsulfanyl-5- ( 4'-methanesulfonyl-2-methyl-biphenyl-4-yloxymethyl ) -[1 , 2 , 4] triazol-4-yl]-pyridine , an allosteric inhibitor of VCP ATPase activity , is a highly specific and robust VCP ATPase inhibitor ( Magnaghi et al . , 2013 ) . ML240 , 2- ( 2-Amino-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl ) \u22128-methoxy-N- ( phenylmethyl ) \u22124-quinazolinamine is another potent inhibitor , which competitively blocks ATP binding to VCP ( Chou et al . , 2013 ) . These drugs and their derivatives were developed for treatment of cancers ( Magnaghi et al . , 2013; Chou et al . , 2013; Deshaies , 2014; Zhou et al . , 2015 ) . The ability of these compounds to rescue defects in IBMPFD models has not been reported . We first examined the effects of VCP inhibitors delivered to Drosophila through feeding . Various concentrations of drug or DMSO were included in food during the first to third larval instars , and muscle mitochondrial morphology was characterized at 2 and 6 days after eclosion . NMS-873 or ML240 feeding resulted in dramatic mitochondrial elongation in wildtype animals as visualized with MitoGFP using light microscopy ( Figure 7A\u2013A\u2019\u2019 ) and at the ultrastructural level using EM ( Figure 7B\u2013B\u2019\u2019\u2019 ) . These phenotypes are similar to those observed following VCP RNAi ( Figure 1C\u2013C\u2019\u2019 ) . In another respect , drug-treated animals developed normally ( data not shown ) . The smaller mitochondria phenotype associated with overexpression of VCP WT was also significantly suppressed following feeding with 30 \u00b5M NMS-873 or 30 \u00b5M ML240 ( Figure 7C\u2013C\u2019\u2019\u2019 ) . Feeding with NMS-873 and ML240 also reversed the phenotypic rescue of mitochondrial defects caused by expression of VCP WT , RH and AE in PINK1 mutants ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Supporting these results , feeding with NMS-873 also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the levels of Mfn ( Figure 7D ) . Together , these observations suggest that NMS-873 and ML240 inhibit endogenous VCP in vivo , resulting in a phenocopy of loss of VCP function . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 017Figure 7 . VCP inhibitors promote mitochondrial elongation . ( A\u2013A\u2019\u2019 ) MitoGFP assay for mitochondrial morphology .

Mitochondria are small in VCP WT flies ( C ) as compared with WT ( IFM-Gal4 control , B ) . This phenotype is reversed by 30 \u00b5M NMS-873 ( C\u2019 ) or 30 \u00b5M ML240 ( C\u2019\u2019 ) feeding and shifted towards a pro-fusion direction , as the mitochondria are also elongated as compared with WT ( B ) .

VCP inhibitor treatment blocks VCP WT and disease mutant rescue of mitochondrial defects in a PINK1 mutant .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 018 We then fed NMS-873 and ML240 to VCP RH and AE disease mutant flies and analyzed mitochondrial phenotypes , muscle viability and integrity in 6-day-old flies . Flies were fed with 30 \u00b5M NMS-873 or 30 \u00b5M ML240 from first instar larvae until 6 days after eclosion . In control and VCP WT expressing flies , NMS-873 and ML240 feeding resulted in normal development to adulthood ( data not shown ) and did not cause muscle death or tissue damage; all muscles were TUNEL negative and had an intact\u00a0tissue structure ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Strikingly , NMS-873 and ML240 feeding largely prevented muscle cell death caused by expression of VCP RH or AE ( Figure 8A\u2013B\u2019\u2019 ) . It also significantly rescued disrupted muscle integrity ( Figure 8C\u2013D\u2019\u2019 ) . Rescue of mitochondrial size , cristae structure , and myofibril organization was also observed at the ultrastructural level ( Figure 8E\u2013F\u2019\u2019 ) . It is interesting to note that in the VCP disease mutants feeding groups ( Figure 8E\u2019 , E\u2019\u2019 , F\u2019 and F\u2019\u2019 ) , mitochondria remained somewhat smaller as compared to wildtype in Figure 7B . Elongated mitochondria , such as those observed in the wildtype and VCP WT feeding groups ( Figure 7B\u2019 , B\u2019\u2019 , C\u2019 and C\u2019\u2019 ) , were never observed in the VCP RH and VCP AE groups even though all were fed the same concentration of inhibitors . This partial suppression further suggests that these mutants are hyperactive . Finally , we note that VCP inhibitor feeding also resulted in significant rescue of a number of other phenotypes in VCP RH and AE expressing flies , including those associated with p62 , ubiquitin and TDP43 ( Figure 8G\u2013L\u2019\u2019 ) . Together , these observations suggest that VCP disease mutants are hyperactive in multiple aspects , and that disease phenotypes can be suppressed by inhibition of VCP ATPase activity . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 019Figure 8 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 020 The above data demonstrated a decrease in Mfn 1 and 2 levels , mitochondrial fusion defects and impaired mitochondrial respiratory function in IBMPFD patient cells . Next , we explored the effects of these drugs on these changes in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts . In patient cells , a high concentration of ML240 ( 10 \u00b5M , with IC50 of 110 nM ) or NMS-873 ( 10 \u00b5M , with IC50 of 30 nM ) led to cell death , and NMS-873 directly inhibits mitochondrial respiration ( data not shown ) . However , when lower concentrations of ML240 are used , robust rescue effects are observed ( Figure 9 ) . As shown in Figure 9A , immortalized IBMPFD patient fibroblasts have decreased Mfn 1 levels , and these are increased by treatment with 250 nM ML240 for 6 hr . Overall mitochondrial morphology of IBMPFD fibroblasts does not change in response to inhibitor treatment ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . However , in a more sensitive assay in which rates of fusion are measured directly , mitochondrial fusion defects in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts were significantly rescued after 6 hr\u00a0of treatment with 250 nM ML240 ( Figure 9B ) . Finally , 50 nM and 100 nM ML240 treatment for 4 days also significantly enhanced the basal and maximal oxygen consumption rate ( OCR ) in patient fibroblasts ( Figure 9C ) . Similarly , 1 nM and 10 nM NMS-873 treatment for 6 days significantly enhanced the maximal oxygen consumption rate ( OCR ) in patient fibroblasts as well ( Figure 9D ) . The fact that two inhibitors with different mechanisms generate similar results in terms of rescuing IBMFPD pathologies reduces the likelihood that these are off-targeting effects . Together , these data strongly support the effects of VCP inhibitors as potential therapeutic tools for IBMPFD disease . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 021Figure 9 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 022 \n Missense mutations of VCP lead to the autosomal dominant disease IBMPFD . However , it is controversial whether these mutations cause disease through a dominant active or dominant negative manner . Moreover , the molecular mechanisms by which VCP mutations alter mitochondrial function are unclear . Here , we have investigated the endogenous function of VCP , cellular effects of expression of VCP disease mutants , and the ability of VCP inhibitors to suppress VCP disease pathology in Drosophila and patient fibroblasts . In summary , we have made the following findings: Endogenous VCP regulates mitochondrial fusion ( Figure 10A ) . Loss of VCP function leads to increased Mfn levels and increased mitochondrial size in multiple tissues . Conversely , VCP overexpression results in reduced Mfn levels and decreased mitochondrial size . VCP physically interacts with Mfn via domains that are also used to bind its substrates in other contexts . Thus , it is likely that Mfn is an endogenous VCP substrate . Here we provide the first in vivo evidence in muscle , the major disease tissue in IBMPFD , that Mfn is a specific endogenous target of VCP . Regulation of endogenous Mfn by VCP is unexpected , given that VCP is an abundant protein implicated in multiple cellular processes , but has not been shown to localize to mitochondria that are not depolarized by CCCP . We show that VCP-dependent removal of Mfn does not require Parkin or Mul1 , E3 ligases known to ubiquitinate Mfn . How VCP brings about Parkin and Mul1-independent removal of Mfn requires further investigation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 023Figure 10 . Proposed mechanisms of VCP disease mutants mediated mitochondrial defects and potential therapeutic role of VCP inhibitors . ( A ) Under physiological conditions , VCP , independent of PINK1/parkin and Mul1 , negatively regulates Mfn protein levels , which are critical for the proper balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission . ( B ) In the IBMPFD disease , the\u00a0enhanced ATPase activity of a VCP disease mutant protein results in excessive loss of Mfn and mitochondrial fusion , leading to mitochondrial fusion defects . Besides the mitochondrial defects , VCP disease mutants also generate pathology including adult muscle tissue damage and muscle cell death . ( C ) VCP ATPase inhibitors robustly relieve the pathology caused by VCP disease mutants associated with hyperactive VCP activity while leaving normal VCP-dependent functions intact . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 023 IBMPFD is 100% penetrant , and myopathy is the most prevalent ( affecting 90% of patients ) and primary symptom of IBMPFD patients . We generated an IBMPFD disease model in adult Drosophila muscle , and used this system to monitor tissue pathology , and investigate the\u00a0molecular mechanisms by which VCP disease mutants function . We show that compared to VCP WT , expression of VCP disease mutants results in tissue damage , mitochondrial fusion defects and decreased levels of Mfn ( Figure 10B ) . These phenotypes are opposite to those associated with decreased levels of VCP , or expression of an ATPase defective mutant version of VCP . Expression of VCP disease mutants , but not a VCP ATPase defective mutant or VCP RNAi , also suppresses the mitochondrial defects mediated by accumulation of Mfn in PINK1 null , parkin null , and parkin mul1 double null mutants . Taken together , these results suggest that VCP disease mutants do not function as loss-of-function or dominant negative mutants , but rather as dominant activated mutants in regulating Mfn levels and bringing about mitochondrial fusion defects . This conclusion is further supported by our findings that mitochondrial fusion and Mfn levels are also decreased in VCP disease mutant fibroblasts . Our finding that VCP overexpression suppresses a parkin null mutant in addition to a PINK1 null stands in contrast to what was reported in Kim et al . , who proposed that VCP-dependent degradation of Mfn required recruitment by Parkin . In addition , we also find that VCP overexpression suppresses phenotypes due to double mutants of parkin and mul1 , which acts in a parallel pathway to degrade Mfn ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) . Together , these observations show that VCP-dependent regulation of Mfn does not require PINK1 or parkin . The VCP-dependent degradation of Mfn we observe is also specific and unlikely to be mediated through a more general process such as mitophagy , as levels of several other mitochondrial proteins are not altered by VCP overexpression . However , these results do not exclude models in which Parkin activation further promotes VCP-dependent Mfn degradation , which may or may not involve mitophagy , under some conditions . Regarding the mechanisms of VCP disease mutant action , in vitro biochemistry studies suggest that they have increased ATPase activities , thus favoring a dominant active model ( Weihl et al . , 2006; Zhang et al . , 2015; Niwa et al . , 2012; Manno et al . , 2010; Tang and Xia , 2013 ) . In addition , in vivo data from Drosophila shows that eye phenotypes caused by VCP disease mutant expression can be alleviated through loss of one copy of wildtype VCP . This also is consistent with models in which VCP mutants have increased activity ( Chang et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , in cell culture studies Bartolome , et al showed that VCP disease mutant expression led to mitochondria respiratory chain defects , as did VCP RNAi ( Bartolome et al . , 2013 ) ; Ritz , et al showed that VCP disease mutant expression impaired endocytosis to the same extent as that of VCP ATPase defective mutants ( Ritz et al . , 2011 ) . While the above studies can be interpreted as showing that VCP disease mutants function as loss-of-function or dominant negative mutants , these results do not rule out the possibility that disease mutants are hyperactive alleles . For example , an alternative interpretation of the impairment of respiratory chain function observed following VCP disease mutant expression or following VCP RNAi is that either an increase or a decrease in the levels of VCP activity leads to mitochondrial defects , which is what we observed in this study . Currently there is no treatment that can halt the progression of IBMPFD . Our findings that VCP disease mutants are hyperactive provide important therapeutic implications . Indeed , we find VCP inhibitors potently rescue multiple VCP disease phenotypes in flies and patient cells ( Figure 10C ) . Importantly , suppression includes phenotypes beyond mitochondria ( Figure 10C ) , involving TDP43 , p62 and ubiquitin , suggesting that these inhibitors are likely to be effective in therapeutic settings . Of course , in order for VCP inhibitors to be useful as therapeutics , it will be necessary to inhibit mutant forms of VCP to an extent sufficient to suppress disease without bringing about a deleterious decrease in the activity of wildtype VCP . Our observation that Drosophila fed inhibitors are suppressed with respect to VCP disease phenotypes , but otherwise develop normally , suggests that this therapeutic goal may be possible . Finally , VCP disease mutants are associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( Abramzon et al . , 2012 ) , and hereditary spastic paraplegia ( de Bot et al . , 2012 ) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease ( Gonzalez et al . , 2014 ) . Our findings suggest possible therapeutic values of VCP inhibitors for these diseases . \n Full length VCP ( 1-802aa ) , and truncated VCP cDNAs \u2206N-VCP ( 186\u2013802 aa ) , \u2206N\u00a0+\u00a0D1-VCP ( 456\u2013802 aa ) and \u2206D2-VCP ( 1\u2013477 aa ) were amplified from VCP cDNA derived from pUASt-VCP WT , a gift from Dr .

Primary fibroblasts were immortalized by infection with retrovirus expressing hTERT ( Addgene plasmid #1771 ) . Infected cells were selected in puromycin ( 1 . 5 ug/mL ) for 1 week and maintained in 1 ug/ml puromycin . S2 cells , fly thoraxes or fibroblasts were lysed in RIPA Buffer with Protease Inhibitors ( Roche ) and 200 mM PMSF ( Sigma ) .

Anti-Drosophila Mfn Rabbit polyclonal antibody ( 1:3000 ) was a gift from Dr . Alexander Whitworth ( Ziviani et al . , 2010 ) . Donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit HRP conjugated secondary antibodies ( GE Healthcare , 1:10000 or 20000 ) were used . 48 hr after transfection , S2 cells were harvested and lysed in the RIPA Buffer with protease inhibitors . Protein lysates were incubated with Dynabeads G and primary antibody ( Anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody , Millipore 1:300 ) at 4\u00b0C overnight and washed in 0 . 1%Tween/PBS four times and eluted in 2XSDS sample buffer ( BioRad ) and denatured at 95\u00b0C . The samples are assayed by western blot . Powdered forms of NMS-873 ( Selleckchem ) and ML240 ( Sigma-Aldrich ) were dissolved in DMSO as stocks . Stock solution and DMSO as the vehicle control were diluted in ethanol/ddH2O and mixed with Drosophila food . Food dye was added to ensure thorough mix . Parents of desired genotypes were put in DMSO or inhibitors containing food for 3 days and removed . Thus , all growth following egg laying occurred in the presence of inhibitors . Immediately after eclosion , the\u00a0progeny were transferred to newly prepared food vials containing the same concentration of DMSO or inhibitors . The\u00a0progeny was assayed at the time points stated in the text . For human fibroblast treatment , stock solution of ML240 , NMS-873 and DMSO vehicle control were diluted to the desired concentration and added to the culture media . Media were changed each day if the treatment was longer than 24 hr . The mitochondrial fusion assay was performed using photoactivatable mitoGFP ( PA-GFP ) localized to the mitochondrial matrix as previously described ( Mishra et al . , 2014b; Karbowski et al . , 2004 ) . Briefly , immortalized fibroblasts were infected with retroviruses expressing matrix-treated DsRed and matrix-targeted PA-GFP to create stable cell lines . Cells were plated on glass coverslips ( LabTek ) and imaged live at 37\u00b0C on an LSM 710 confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) . PA-GFP is activated in a region of interest ( 5 \u00b5m x 5 \u00b5m ) by illumination with a 405 nm laser . The activated signal is collected in z-stacks every 3 min over the next 30 min . Fusion events result in the dilution of the activated signal , and the average pixel intensity ( for the entire cell ) over time is a measurement of fusion rates ( Karbowski et al . , 2004 ) . P-values are calculated using a Student\u2019s t-test on the slopes of intensity versus time for individual measurements ( >20 per genotype ) . Oxygen consumption rates ( OCR ) were measured in immortalized fibroblasts using a Seahorse Biosciences Extracellular Flux Analyzer ( Model XF96 ) .

Oxygen levels were measured over 5 min periods . Oxygen consumption rate was measured under basal and stress conditions as indicated . Oligomycin inhibits complex V and blocks ATP production dependent on respiration . CCCP uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production . It maximizes respiration without ATP synthesis .

For drug pre-treatment studies ( Figure 9C\u2013D ) , 5000 cells/well were plated into 96 well culture plates and pre-treated with ML240 for 4 days and NMS-873 for 6 days prior to OCR measurement .

These molecules are created through a series of chemical reactions that start with an odourless precursor , a compound produced in glands located in our armpits . Then , a type of bacteria called Staphylococcus hominis takes in these molecules and transforms them into smelly thioalcohols . The precise details of how the bacteria do this are not clear . Now , Minhas , Bawdon et al . show how S . hominis uses a transport protein in its membrane to bring the odourless precursor inside . In the experiments , tools such as X-ray crystallography captured snapshots of this transporter as it was moving the compound into the bacteria . This helped to understand how the bacteria recognize these precursors , as well as the exact structure of these molecules and of their transporters . The experiments also reveal that bacteria which do not create odour can also ingest the precursors through this same process . This suggests that the odour production is a unique process that happens once these molecules are inside S . hominis . The findings imply that humans and their body odour-producing bacteria likely evolved together . In other mammals , the bacterial production of bodily smells is linked to the release of pheromones , which are chemicals involved in communication and in selecting sexual partners . It is not clear whether this is also true for humans . Ultimately , learning more about how S . hominis converts precursor molecules into thioalcohols could lead to new ways of nipping body odours in the bud .", "source": "Mammals produce volatile odours that convey different types of societal information . In Homo sapiens , this is now recognised as body odour , a key chemical component of which is the sulphurous thioalcohol , 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol ( 3M3SH ) . Volatile 3M3SH is produced in the underarm as a result of specific microbial activity , which act on the odourless dipeptide-containing malodour precursor molecule , S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH , secreted in the axilla ( underarm ) during colonisation . The mechanism by which these bacteria recognise S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH and produce body odour is still poorly understood . Here we report the structural and biochemical basis of bacterial transport of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH by Staphylococcus hominis , which is converted to the sulphurous thioalcohol component 3M3SH in the bacterial cytoplasm , before being released into the environment . Knowledge of the molecular basis of precursor transport , essential for body odour formation , provides a novel opportunity to design specific inhibitors of malodour production in humans . \n In Homo sapiens\u00a0the skin of the underarm ( axilla ) provides a unique niche for bacteria . Through the secretions of various glands , that open onto the skin or into hair follicles , this environment is nutrient-rich and hosts a unique microbial community ( Taylor et al . , 2003 ) . Esterified fatty acids and other lipids are secreted by the sebaceous gland , while the eccrine glands produce a dilute salt solution with lactate and other organic solutes being secreted ( Bovell , 2015 ) . A third exocrine gland , the apocrine , which is more specialized and found only in the axilla , areolae , genitalia and external auditory meatus ( ear canal ) ( Collins , 1989 ) , starts secreting an odourless lipid-rich viscous secretion with the onset of puberty ( Figure 1A ) . The lipid rich secretion is not involved in thermoregulation like the eccrine gland and in mammals has a likely role in scent generation ( Collins , 1989 ) . In humans , the link between the axillary apocrine gland , underarm bacteria and body odour ( BO ) , was first recognised over 50 years ago ( Shelley et al . , 1953 ) and early culture-based studies on this relationship found the axillary microbiota to be dominated by Staphylococcus , Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium species , with the Corynebacteria in particular correlating with malodour intensity ( Taylor et al . , 2003; Leyden et al . , 1981 ) . More recent culture-independent meta-taxonomic studies have confirmed that the axilla is dominated by these genera , although the presence of additional taxa not previously indicated by culture-based methods is also evident , notably Gram-positive anaerobic cocci ( GPAC ) belonging to the Anaerococcus and Peptoniphilus genera ( Costello et al . , 2009; Egert et al . , 2011; Troccaz et al . , 2015 ) . Various molecules produced in the axilla have been linked to malodour , including 16-androstene steroids ( Gower et al . , 1994 ) and short-chain ( C2-C5 ) volatile fatty acids ( VFAs ) produced by axillary bacteria via several metabolic routes ( James et al . , 2004 ) . However , 16-androstenes are now believed to be only minor contributors to axillary malodour ( James et al . , 2013 ) , and it is accepted that the VFAs most heavily involved in BO are a series of structurally-unusual medium-chain ( C6-C10 ) acids originating from N-acylglutamine precursors present in apocrine sweat ( Natsch et al . , 2003; Natsch et al . , 2006 ) . A third class of molecule , the thioalcohols ( also called sulfanylalkanols ) , have recently been identified as important components of human body odour and a number of these have been detected within the volatiles released from the underarm ( Troccaz et al . , 2004; Natsch et al . , 2004; Hasegawa et al . , 2004 ) . They are particularly pungent and can be detected in pg . l\u22121 quantities , an order of magnitude lower than many other volatile chemicals emanating from the skin ( Natsch et al . , 2004 ) . The most abundant and pungent of these thioalcohols is 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol ( 3M3SH ) ( Figure 1B ) , which is a primary causal molecule of axillary malodour and subsequent BO ( Troccaz et al . , 2004; Hasegawa et al . , 2004 ) . Thioalcohols are known to be released as a peptide-conjugated precursor from the apocrine gland , which secretes directly into the hair follicle ( Figure 1A ) . The biosynthetic origin of the thioalcohol precursors is currently poorly understood , but they are thought to be secreted into the axilla via the ABC transporter ABCC11 as odourless glutathione conjugates ( Baumann et al . , 2014a ) . The glutathione conjugated form ( SG-3M3SH ) has never been detected in axillary sweat; however , the L-cysteinylglycine dipeptide conjugated form , S-[1- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) \u22121-methylbutyl]-L-cysteinylglycine ( S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ) ( Figure 1B ) , is readily detectable ( Starkenmann et al . , 2005 ) and recently a \u03b3-glutamyl transferase ( GGT1 ) has been demonstrated to localise to the apocrine sweat gland and convert SG-3M3SH to S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ( Baumann et al . , 2014a ) ( Figure 1C ) . We and others have demonstrated that S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH can be taken up and metabolised by a highly limited range of staphylococcal species present in the axilla , namely Staphylococcus hominis , Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylocooccus lugdunensis , to liberate 3M3SH , that subsequently exits the cell through an undefined mechanism ( Troccaz et al . , 2004; Starkenmann et al . , 2005; Bawdon et al . , 2015 ) . A strong correlation between S . hominis and body odour production has recently been established using culture-independent taxonomic studies of the axillary microbiota ( Troccaz et al . , 2015 ) , confirming the biological significance of this low-abundance species within the axilla in BO production in humans . However , the mechanism by which the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH precursor molecule is taken up into S . hominis and related thioalcohol producers is currently unknown , hampering efforts to identify novel mechanisms to disrupt this process and control odour production in humans . Here we identify the biochemical and structural basis for the recognition and specific transport of the malodour precursor peptide , S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH , into S . hominis . We first show that S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is actively taken up by S . hominis through a specific secondary active transporter , STAH0001_1446 ( SH1446 ) , a member of the proton coupled oligopeptide transporter ( POT ) family ( Hagting et al . , 1994; Paulsen and Skurray , 1994 ) . Through a combination of structural , biochemical and cell based assays we reveal how this peptide transporter is able to recognise a thioalcohol-conjugated peptide and further , show that transport is coupled to the inwardly directed proton electrochemical gradient . Our results suggest that SH1446 is a clear target for inhibitor design to prevent malodour production , thus providing further molecular insights into the role of the skin microbiota in human scent generation . \n To elucidate how thiol-conjugated dipeptides are transported by bacteria , we first examined the model organism Escherichia coli , which is able to recognise and metabolise the dipeptide version of the non-physiological malodour precursor S-benzyl-L-cysteine , namely , S-benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine ( James et al . , 2013 ) . Resting cells of E . coli were indeed able to remove S-benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine from solution and break it down to release the thiol active product , benzyl mercaptan ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . Following transport into the cell , the dipeptide must be cleaved to release the benzyl mercaptan , most likely through a cysteine-S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase-type activity , for which a number have been described in E . coli , including MetC and MalY ( Dwivedi et al . , 1982; Zdych et al . , 1995; Awano et al . , 2003 ) . Interestingly , TnaA which is a tryptophanase known to have L-cysteine desulfhydrase activity ( Awano et al . , 2005 ) is also capable of releasing benzyl mercaptan . Individual disruption of metC and malY did not decrease the amount of benzyl mercaptan produced by E . coli , while disruption of tnaA led to an almost complete loss of biotransformation ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . This suggests that E . coli takes up the S-benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine , whereupon a host dipeptidase cleaves the glycine residue prior to cleavage of the S-benzyl-cysteine by TnaA to release the benzyl mercaptan . To discover the genetic basis of the transport and metabolism of these thiol-conjugated dipeptides , we exploited the knock out ( KO ) library of single gene disruptions in E . coli K-12 ( Baba et al . , 2006 ) . We hypothesised that the dipeptide moiety might direct the molecule through a peptide transporter . In E . coli the main peptide systems are relatively well characterised , the two main transport systems belong to the ATP binding cassette ( ABC ) family and the proton dependent oligopeptide transporter ( POT ) family ( Figure 2B ) . The E . coli Opp and Dpp ABC transporters have been extensively studied in E . coli and the closely related bacterium Salmonella typhimurium ( Smith et al . , 1999; Klepsch et al . , 2011; Abouhamad et al . , 1991; Goodell and Higgins , 1987; Tame et al . , 1995 ) and an E . coli BW25113 strain with non-functional Opp and Dpp system ( \u0394DB1 ) , was used to assess the role of these transporters in the production of benzyl mercaptan . Surprisingly , benzyl mercaptan production was similar to the wild-type strain , suggesting that neither ABC transporter was important for Cys-Gly-conjugate transport ( Figure 2A ) . Having ruled out transport via the ABC peptide transporters , we then broadened our search to include additional peptide transporters that have been described in E . coli . These were the four members of the proton dependent oligopeptide transporter , or POT family , encoded by dtpA-D , that have poorly defined physiological roles during growth on peptides ( Harder et al . , 2008; Prabhala et al . , 2014; Casagrande et al . , 2009 ) , the CstA protein , orthologues of which have been demonstrated to be peptide transporters ( Garai et al . , 2016 ) and the Sap system , which is implicated in uptake of cationic antimicrobial peptides ( Groisman et al . , 1992 ) . Most of these strains had similar levels of benzyl mercaptan production to the wild-type , with the exception of dtpB which had an overall 50% drop in thiol production ( Figure 2A ) . These data suggest that transporters belonging to the POT family are most likely responsible for Cys-Gly-conjugate transport , revealing a new biological role for bacterial POT transporters in the uptake of Cys-Gly- ( S ) conjugates . Having established that E . coli has the ability to transport and cleave a Cys-Gly- ( S ) conjugated substrate , we reasoned that overexpression of a POT transporter might confer the ability to recognise the physiological malodour precursor S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH . The four dtp genes were cloned into a pBAD vector commonly used for overexpression of membrane transporters ( Mulligan et al . , 2009; Mulligan et al . , 2012 ) and transformed into the wild-type E . coli background . The ability of the resulting strains to convert S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH to 3M3SH was subsequently measured ( Bawdon et al . , 2015 ) . Consistent with the reduction in benzyl mercaptan production reported in Figure 2A , the dtpB gene alone was able to confer a malodour production ( BO+ ) phenotype to E . coli , which was not seen with any of the other dtp genes ( Figure 2C ) . The same pattern was observed with S-benzyl-Cys-Gly as a substrate ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B ) , suggesting that DtpB has a unique ability to transport these unusual conjugated peptides . The molecular basis for S-Cys-Gly-3M3H transport into malodour producing staphylococci is unknown , and the genetic intractability of these poorly studied coagulase negative Staphylococcal species makes it difficult to study using genetic approaches . We therefore used an alternative approach exploiting our discovery that expression of a transporter in trans could produce a BO+ phenotype to E . coli . Given our discovery that E . coli POT family peptide transporters can transport S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH , we examined the genome of S . hominis SK1119 , as S . hominis are the most abundant malodour producing Staphylococcal species in the underarm microbiota . Unlike E . coli , S . hominis contains only a single POT family member DtpT ( SH1446 ) , orthologues of which were seen in all sequenced staphylococci ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A ) . The POT peptide systems remain largely uncharacterised in staphyoloccci , although in the well-studied pathogen S . aureus , the single POT transporter encoded by dtpT is the sole route for dipeptide uptake in this species ( Hiron et al . , 2007 ) . We also identified a second system , encoded by STAHO0001_0415 ( SH0415 ) , which is annotated as an MFS transporter and only present in S . hominis and S . haemolyticus , two known thioalcohol producers , and which is genetically linked to genes involved in peptide and amino acid metabolism ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B ) . Both transporters were cloned into pBADcLIC2005 and transformed into E . coli for functional analysis . When levels of 3M3SH production were measured in these strains , uptake was only enhanced by the presence of SH1446 , with SH0415 having little effect on 3M3SH activity ( Figure 2D ) . In contrast , with S-benzyl-cysteinlyglycine as a substrate , there was no increase in production of benzyl mercaptan with SH1446 but a significant increase was observed with SH0415 ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . Together these data strongly support the conclusion that the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH transporter in S . hominis is the POT transporter STAH0001_1446 ( SH1446 ) . To further demonstrate the importance of SH1446 in the physiological transport of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH we used a biochemical approach to examine whether peptides could inhibit 3M3SH production by competing with S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH uptake . Firstly , we used our E . coli system where 3M3SH production is seen when SH1446 is expressed in trans and we observed clear inhibition of 3M3SH production with both di- and tri-Ala peptides ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4 ) but not with L-Ala alone nor tetra-Ala . The purified TnaA enzyme that cleaves Cys-3M3SH was not inhibited by any of these peptides ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5 ) , supporting the hypothesis that the whole cell inhibition is due to inhibition of peptide transport . Similarly , we measured the ability of the same peptides to inhibit 3M3SH production directly in S . hominis\ufeff ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4\ufeff ) and observed a comparable profile . It should be noted that a significant affect was observed for 25 mM tetra-Ala in S . hominis wild-type , however this affect is due to the acidic pH that was required to dissolve the peptide which appears to inhibit metabolism in S . hominis but not E . coli . POT transporters belong to the Major Facilitator Superfamily ( MFS ) and use an inwardly directed proton electrochemical gradient to drive the concentrative uptake of di- and tri-peptides across the cell membrane for metabolic assimilation ( Daniel and Kottra , 2004 ) . To establish SH1446 as the protein responsible for S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH recognition and transport , the gene was cloned and overexpressed in E . coli for functional and structural studies . The purified protein , hereafter referred to as PepTSh ( Peptide Transporter Staphylococcus hominis ) was purified and reconstituted into liposomes . Transport was studied using a previously employed pyranine based reporter assay , which measures transport via changes to the internal pH of the liposomes ( Parker et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 3A ) . Acidification of the lumen of the liposome was observed in the presence of a membrane potential ( \u0394\u03a8 , negative inside ) , and addition of external di- or tri-peptide substrate , demonstrating that PepTSh is a proton coupled peptide transporter . Importantly we also observed acidification in the presence of the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH precursor peptide , confirming our earlier identification of PepTSh as the transporter for this molecule in S . hominis . To understand the recognition of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH compared to natural peptides , we determined IC50 values using competition with 3H-di-alanine . The IC50 value for tri-alanine , di-alanine and Cys-Gly were 23 . 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 . 4 , 72 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 . 7 and 115\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022 . 2 \u03bcM , respectively ( Figure 3B ) , indicating that PepTSh is able to recognise tri-Ala more favourably than di-Ala . However , for S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH the IC50 value was 362\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021 . 8 \u03bcM , three-fold higher than the Cys-Gly peptide . Our data therefore show that while PepTSh can transport the modified peptide , the addition of the thioalcohol group on the cysteine side chain has substantially impaired the recognition and transport versus natural peptides . To gain further insight into the mechanism of substrate binding we successfully obtained a high-resolution co-crystal structure of PepTSh at 2 . 5 \u00c5 resolution , bound to S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH using the in meso crystallisation method ( Figure 4A , Table 1 and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . PepTSh adopts the canonical MFS fold with helices H1-H6 forming the N-terminal bundle and H7-H12 the C-terminal bundle . PepTSh was crystallised in\u00a0an inward open state , observed previously for other members of the POT family ( Newstead , 2015 ) , wherein the extracellular gate , consisting of helices H1-2 and H7-8 from the N- and C-terminal bundles respectively , is closed and the intracellular gate , consisting of helices H4-5 and H10-11 is open . Similar to other bacterial POT family members , PepTSh contains two additional helices inserted between the N- and C-terminal bundles , termed HA and HB ( Figure 4B and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Unlike previous POT structures however , PepTSh also contains a well-structured \u03b2-hairpin motif between helices H7 and H8 on the extracellular side of the membrane , extending out in line with the lipid head groups . Interestingly we observed a number of monoolein lipid molecules that cluster around both the \u03b2- hairpin and the cavity created between helices HA and HB with the transporter domain . The role of helices HA and HB in prokaryotic POT family transporters still remains unclear . However , the observation of lipid molecules bound between these helices and the transport domain suggests a possible role in stabilising these transporters in the membrane , which may be an adaption specific to prokaryotic members of the POT family ( Newstead et al . , 2011 ) . Following extensive screening and co-crystallisation we observed clear mFo-DFc difference electron density for the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ligand in the peptide binding site ( Figure 4C and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . The Cys-Gly part of the precursor is positioned such that the carboxy termini of the peptide faces towards the intracellular side of the binding site . The terminal carboxyl group makes two hydrogen bond interactions , one with Tyr41 on H1 and a second interaction to a water molecule ( W107 ) , which links the carboxyl group with Asn347 on H8 . The carbonyl group of the CG peptide also makes a hydrogen bond to this water molecule , creating a well-coordinated interaction network between the peptide and Asn347 ( Figure 4D ) . The terminal amino group makes two further polar interactions , with a water molecule that sits next to Tyr41 and also to the carbonyl group of Gln344 , which sits further up on H8 . In contrast , the thioalcohol moiety points towards the extracellular gate , with the sulphur atom sitting close to Gln310 on H7 , whereas the alcohol group extends towards helix H8 making interactions with backbone carbonyl and amide groups of Phe343 and Asn347 , respectively . The acyl group extends into a large pocket nestled between helices H7 and H10 ( Figure 4E ) . This long pocket ( ~10 \u00c5 ) extends from the central peptide binding site into the C-terminal bundle of the transporter and is both hydrophobic and polar in character . Previously , we showed that a related POT family transporter , PepTSt , is able to bind peptides in different orientations in the binding site , with a di-peptide adopting a horizontal position and a tri-peptide a vertical one ( Lyons et al . , 2014 ) and suggested this flexibility may be responsible for the accomodation of larger peptide ligands ( Newstead , 2017 ) . Here we see that the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH peptide adopts a more vertical orientation , similar to the tri-alanine position in PepTSt . However , there are significant differences in the interactions . A structural overlay of the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH peptide shows that it sits much further up in the binding site compared to the natural peptides captured in PepTSt ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4A & B ) , most likely as a result of the requirement to accommodate the thioalcohol group in the extended pocket . This has a knock-on effect with respect to the position of the amino and carboxy termini . In PepTSt , the amino terminal group of the di-peptide directly interacts with helix H8 and H10 , whereas the tri-peptide makes a much weaker interaction through a carbonyl group . In contrast , in\u00a0PepTSh\u00a0this interaction is achieved through a water mediated hydrogen bond ( Figure 4D ) . The role of water in mediating interactions between peptides and their binding sites has been previously observed in the ABC transporter binding domains ( Tame et al . , 1995 ) , albeit for side chain independent binding . A similar mechanism may be employed by PepTSh to facilitate transport of modified peptides by replacing direct interactions between the peptide and the transporter when these are sterically restricted , as we observe with S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH . The interaction of the amino termini of peptides with both the mammalian and bacterial POT family transporters has been identified as facilitating high affinity binding ( Weitz et al . , 2007;\u00a0Meredith et al . , 2000 ) . The reduced IC50 value for the modified peptide in PepTSh ( Figure 3B ) , may therefore\u00a0be a combination of steric restraints resulting in the accommodation of the extended side chain group , and the subsequent knock on effects on the position of the interactions between the amino and carboxy groups with conserved side chains in the binding site . S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is the first human derived peptide with a modified side chain to be captured in a POT family transporter , and contains biochemical features similar to physiological peptides ( Cys-Gly ) , but also incorporates the non-peptide thioalcohol group ( 3M3SH ) . We therefore wished to explore whether S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is recognised using a similar mechanism to physiological peptides . Several mutations in the binding site that have previously been shown to play an important role in peptide recognition within the bacterial POT family were therefore generated ( Newstead , 2017 ) . Tyrosine 41 forms part of a conserved E33xxERFxYY41 motif on TM1 ( Solcan et al . , 2012 ) , which plays a role in proton coupling and influences peptide uptake in several POT family members ( Doki et al . , 2013; Ernst et al . , 2009; Guettou et al . , 2014; Lyons et al . , 2014 ) . In PepTSh Tyr41 hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl terminus of the terminal glycine amino acid in S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ( Figure 4C , D ) . Mutating Tyr41 to phenylalanine or alanine severely reduced transport of di-alanine compared to WT protein ( Figure 5A ) . A similar negative effect on transport was observed in the related POT family transporter PepTSt , from Streptococcus thermophilus ( Solcan et al . , 2012 ) , suggesting a common role for the conserved tyrosine in peptide recognition within the POT family . We then used the same variants in our whole cell assay for 3M3SH production . Interestingly , while both Tyr41Phe and Tyr41Ala variants had reduced activity , at about 50% of the wild-type protein ( Figure 5B ) , the phenotype was not as severe as that observed in the liposome based assay . We interpret this result to indicate that recognition of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is less dependent on this residue than di-Ala . We next wanted to test the role of other residues we observed sitting close to the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ligand . In particular , we were interested in the contribution made by the Asn347 and Glu418 , which coordinate a water molecule ( W107 ) linking both the carboxyl and carbonyl groups of the ligand to the binding site ( Figure 4B ) . The equivalent residues in homologous POT family transporters have been implicated in both peptide recognition ( Lyons et al . , 2014 ) and gating ( Solcan et al . , 2012 ) , and in the case of Glu418 may facilitate the coupling between peptide recognition , proton movement and transport ( Parker et al . , 2017 ) . Although a Glu418Ala variant had no activity in our assays , consistent with its proposed role in coordinating the intracellular gate ( Fowler et al . , 2015 ) , we observed reduced uptake of di-Ala in the Asn347Ala variant ( Figure 5A ) . Interestingly , this reduction was far more severe in the in vivo assay ( Figure 5B ) , indicating that this interaction is more important for transport of the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH peptide than di-Ala . This may reflect the requirement of Asn347 to coordinate the water molecule linking the peptide to the intracellular gate side chain Glu418 , which in the case of the di-peptide may interact directly as in PepTSt , lessening the requirement for the Asn347 interaction . The co-crystal structure also identified the acyl chain portion of the thioalcohol group was accommodated within an extended pocket , formed near the extracellular side of the binding site ( Figure 4E ) . To test the importance of this pocket on S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH transport , we made a Tyr411Trp variant , which would block the cavity . Uptake was noticeably reduced , but still measurable at\u00a0~19% compared to WT ( Figure 5A ) . The same mutation resulted in a similar large decrease in the biotransformation of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH , while a Tyr411Ala mutation had wild-type biotransformation rates ( Figure 5B ) . It is clear that the hydrophobic pocket in PepTSh plays an important role in facilitating the recognition of the thioalcohol group in the binding pocket and , as discussed below , is a potential site for inhibitor design . Taken together the current data lend further support to our model of an adaptable binding site within the POT family that can accommodate chemically diverse peptides and their derivatives through the use of both side chain and water mediated interactions with conserved residues and different specificity pockets to accommodate the different chemical side chains . \n The production of malodour by humans is an evolutionary ancient olfactory process that likely was involved in mate selection and evolutionary processes that relied on chemical signalling ( Stoddart , 1990 ) . Evidence for the microbial origins of chemical signalling molecules is also seen in other animals such as foxes , deer , cats and beetles ( Wyatt , 2003 ) , but the details of this process in humans is less well understood . The thioalcohol 3M3SH , a major component of body odour , is produced in the human axilla as a glutathione-conjugated precursor\u00a0and is\u00a0processed to a unique dipeptide structure ( Figure 1 ) . The discovery that axilla-isolated strains of S . hominis , S . lugdunensis and S . heamolyticus are able to produce 3M3SH prompted the search for the molecular basis for this process ( Bawdon et al . , 2015 ) . While S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is a highly modified and uniquely human dipeptide , we reasoned that this moiety might dictate the uptake mechanism into malodour producing bacteria and here we identify a peptide transporter , PepTSh ( SH1446 ) , from the POT family of secondary active transporters as being responsible for this process . Each of these strains have a POT family transporter that is closely related to PepTSh ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , and we would predict they will also be able to uptake S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH . The genetic intractability of S . hominis dictated that we use a biochemical approach to demonstrate that SH1446 is likely the sole route of uptake of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH . First , this staphylococci has a similar repertoire of peptide transporters in S . aureus , in that it has a single POT transporter and one Opp ABC transporter , and previous work in S . aureus has demonstrated that the POT transporter , DtpT , is essential for growth on dipeptides and some tripeptides , while the ABC transporter ( Opp3 ) has a function in transporting longer oligopeptides ( Hiron et al . , 2007 ) . The use of L-Ala containing peptides as inhibitors in this study demonstrates an inhibitory effect on 3M3SH production that is consistent with the properties of a POT family transporter . Several attempts were made to genetically disrupt SH1446 in S . hominis , using tools developed for S . aureus and S . epidermidis , but these were unsuccessful , most likely due to the presence of multiple species-specific restriction modification ( RM ) systems which render this organism , as with many other coagulase negative ( CoNS ) species , genetically intractable . The specific role for POT transporters in the transport of these unusually modified dipeptides is supported from the inability of the E . coli ABC transporters for oligopeptides and dipeptides , Opp and Dpp , to recognise and transport S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH . Given that S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is effectively a dipeptide with a highly extended R-group on the first amino acid , it is noteworthy that only the promiscuous nature of the POT binding site is able to recognise this ligand . For OppA and DppA , the substrate binding proteins that initially recognise peptides transported by the ABC systems , the binding pocket is well defined and makes general main chain-main chain interactions to ensure that the protein can bind peptides in a sequence independent manner ( Tame et al . , 1995; Sleigh et al . , 1997; Sleigh et al . , 1999 ) . However , the pocket has evolved to accommodate regular amino acid side chains and the unusually large structure of the thioalcohol attachment would likely be sterically incompatible with recognition by either OppA or DppA . The data presented here further support the idea that POT transporters have an unusually promiscuous binding site that may play an evolutionary advantageous role in accepting modified peptides as substrates . Recently , the human POT family transporters , PepT1 and PepT2 , have gained additional attention due to their role in the absorption and retention of several important classes of drug molecule ( Smith et al . , 2013 ) , including peptide modified pro-drugs . Similar to S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH , these pro-drugs are drug molecules conjugated to a peptide or amino acid ( Brandsch , 2013 ) . Pro-drugs are able to compete with natural peptides for transport via PepT1 and PepT2 , and are therefore actively transported into the body ( Ganapathy et al . , 1998; Gupta et al . , 2013; Terada and Inui , 2012 ) . The promiscuous nature of the POT family binding site has been shown to derive , in part , from their ability to recognise peptides in different conformations and through the availability of different specificity pockets , which are able to accommodate chemically different classes of peptides ( Newstead , 2017 ) . Our results here\u00a0provide the first evidence that specificity pockets can also accommodate exotic chemical extensions . The observation that water plays a role in facilitating the interaction between the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH peptide and PepTSh may also indicate a broader role for water in facilitating the recognition of xenobiotic peptides . In particular , the observation that water may bridge interactions between the binding site and either the amino or carboxy group of the ligand would greatly increase the number of conformations a peptide could adopt in the transporter and still trigger proton coupled transport . Finally , we can ask the questions , why do these bacteria transport S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH and can this process be inhibited to provide effective malodour control ? The presumed biochemical pathway for breakdown of the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is outlined in Figure 6 . The firststep is the likely\u00a0removal of the glycine by a dipeptidase and then the lyase reaction that cleaves the carbon-sulphur bond to release pyruvate and ammonia in addition to 3M3SH . The route of export of 3M3SH is unknown , but currently assumed to be diffusion across the bacterial inner membrane . The bacterium will gain a nutritional benefit from the catabolism of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH via the release of both nitrogen and carbon as glycine , pyruvate and ammonia ( Figure 6 ) , which may have been the evolutionary trigger for the adaptation to catabolise this chemical . Asian individuals with single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in ABCC11 , the transporters involved in the secretion of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ( Figure 1 ) have been studied ( Nakano et al . , 2009; Baumann et al . , 2014b ) . Recently , a microbiological investigation of individuals with wild-type alleles of ABCC11 compared to heterozygous and double mutant genotypes revealed that the proportion of Staphylococcus sp . is higher in the underarms of humans that produce the precursor ( Harker et al . , 2014 ) . While these studies are limited in that they do not provide species level identification , they are at least consistent with the idea that the production of the precursor positively correlates with the presence of Staphylococcus sp . in the underarm . The discovery of the transporter and molecular understanding of the mode of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH binding now suggests a specific route to develop inhibitors of malodour production by directly inhibiting the transporter SH1446 ( Grice , 2014 ) . Importantly , such intervention would not impact on the overall axillar microbiome , but instead specifically target the reduction in body odour production . \n Escherichia coli K-12 was used as the model organism throughout this study . Escherichia coli K-12 single gene deletions were obtained from the in-house E . coli Keio collection at University of York . Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary file 1 and 2 . All strains were cultured in LB ( 1% tryptone , 0 . 5% yeast extract , 1% NaCl ) unless otherwise stated , Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations Ampicillin 100 \u03bcg/mL and Kanamycin 50 \u03bcg/mL; L-arabinose concentrations are indicated . PCR , plasmid extractions , and transformations were carried out as per standard protocols . For routine cloning , genomic DNA was extracted from BW25113 and high fidelity KOD polymerase was used ( Novagen ) . Correct clones were\u00a0confirmed by DNA\u00a0sequencing . Specific details of plasmid constructions are detailed below . Multiple gene knockouts were created in single keio deletion strains . To create the double KO strain DB1 ( \u0394oppC \u0394dppC ) , the KanR cassette was removed from a target gene using pCP20 ( encoding Flp recombinase ) at 30\u00b0C , loss of antibiotic cassette was confirmed by PCR and sequencing . The second gene to be disrupted was PCR amplified with 100 bp homology including the FRT flanked KanR cassette from the single gene deletion strain in the keio collection . Targeted gene disruptions were created using \u03bb Red recombination as previously described ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . Overexpression of the E . coli POT transporters were cloned into pBADcLIC2005 vector under the control of arabinose . Full-length genes were amplified from E . coli BW25113 genomic DNA using high fidelity KOD polymerase ( Merck ) using the corresponding primers listed in Supplementary file 3 . In silico analysis of the available Staphylococcus hominis SK1119 genome identified STAH0001_1446 ( SH1446 ) as a POT family member which orthologues present in all sequenced staphylococci and a MFS transporter STAH0001_0415 ( SH0415 ) present in only S . hominis and S . haemolyticus . SH0415 and SH1446 genes were amplified from S . hominis genomic DNA using high fidelity KOD polymerase ( Merck ) using primers listed in Supplementary file 3 . All PCR products were purified using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System ( Promega ) , cloned into pBADcLIC2005 vector using standard ligation-independent cloning ( LIC ) techniques . All fragments were confirmed by PCR and DNA\u00a0sequencing ( GATC Biotech ) . The wildtype STAHO0001_1446 ( SH1446 ) cloned onto the expression plasmid pBADcLIC2005 was used to individually generate the Y411W , Y411A , Y41A , Y41F , N167A and N347A mutants . To introduce the mutation , high fidelity inverse PCR was performed using divergent primers with one per pair being mutagenic ( Supplementary file 3 ) . The resultant products were then circularised by performing a blunt end ligation and transformed into E . coli BW25113 . The mutant sequences were verified by DNA\u00a0sequencing ( GATC Biotech ) . S-Benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine and ( S ) - ( 1- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) \u22121-methylbutyl ) -L-cysteinylglycine ( S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ) ( Peakdale Molecular ) were prepared at a stock concentration of 10 mM in M9 salts ( 6 g Na2HPO4 g/L , 3 g KH2PO4 g/L , 0 . 5 g NaCl g/L ) and stored at 4\u00b0C . E . coli were grown overnight in LB , cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3 , 500 rpm 10 min and resuspended in sterile M9 salts . Where appropriate , E . coli strains harbouring inducible genes on the pBADcLIC2005 plasmid were pre-induced during overnight growth with 0 . 0001% L-arabinose . To a sterile Eppendorf the following was added; 2 mM substrate ( S-Benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine or S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ) , cells to an OD650nm of 5 and M9 salts up to 200 \u03bcL . Cells only ( no added substrate ) and substrate only ( no added cells ) reactions were also included in every individual experiment . The reactions were incubated at 37\u00b0C for up to 48 hr with samples taken at appropriate time points . Liberated thiols were quantified using either MTS/PMS or DTNB labelling as detailed below . Liberated benzyl mercaptan was labelled as follows , 500 \u03bcl from each reaction was taken at the appropriate time point and centrifuged at 13 000 r . p . m . for 2 min . To chemically label benzyl-mercaptan , 50 \u00b5l of labelling reagent , consisting of 4 . 09 mM 3- ( 4 , 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl ) \u22125- ( 3-carboxymethoxyphenyl ) \u22122- ( 4-sulfophenyl ) \u22122H-tetrazolium ( MTS ) ( Promega ) and 0 . 2 mM phenazine methosulfate ( PMS ) ( Sigma ) ( Goodwin et al . , 1995 ) , dissolved in dH2O , was aliquoted into either a 96 well microplate or 0 . 5 ml Eppendorf tubes . For reactions using a 96 well microplate , 200 \u00b5l reaction supernatant was added to the pre- aliquoted 50 \u00b5l MTS/PMS . The plate was sealed with a semi-permeable film lid , incubated at room temperature for 50 min and the A492nm recorded on a Biotek PowerWave XS microplate spectrophotometer . The data was captured by KC junior and exported to Microsoft Excel . For reactions in Eppendorf tubes , 20 \u00b5l - 50 \u00b5l reaction supernatant was added to 50 \u00b5l MTS/PMS . The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 50 min . 20 \u00b5l was subsequently removed and diluted in 980 \u00b5l dH2O in a 1 . 5 ml disposable plastic cuvette . The A492nm was recorded . To quantify free 3M3SH , a 75 \u00b5l volume from each reaction ( isolated as described above ) was taken at the appropriate time point and centrifuged at 13 , 000 rpm for 2 min . 950 \u00b5l labelling solution , consisting of: 800 \u00b5l dH2O , 100 \u00b5l UltraPure Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) and 50 \u00b5l DTNB ( Ellman , 1958 ) stock solution ( 50 mM sodium acetate , 2 mM DTNB , dissolved in dH2O ) was added to a 1 . 5 ml disposable cuvette . 50 \u00b5l reaction supernatant was added to the cuvette , mixed by pipetting and incubated at room temperature for 5 min . The A412nm was recorded on a Jenway 6305 spectrophotometer . ( Van Horn , 2003 ) . Where appropriate , E . coli strains harbouring inducible genes on the pBADcLIC2005 plasmid were pre-induced during overnight growth with 0 . 0001% L-arabinose . In all experiments cells only ( no added substrate ) and substrate only ( no added cells ) were also included . The gene encoding S . hominis SH1446 was cloned into a C-terminal octa histidine GFP fusion vector ( pWaldo-GFPe ) ( Drew et al . , 2006 ) and subsequently transformed into Escherichia coli C43 ( DE3 ) cells ( Miroux and Walker , 1996 ) . Mutations were introduced using site directed mutagenesis followed by DpnI digestion . An overnight starter culture was used to inoculate 4 L of Terrific Broth ( TB ) . Cells were left to grow at 37\u00b0C and aerated by shaking at 250 rpm . Overexpression of the fusion protein was induced when the culture reached an OD600 of\u00a0~0 . 6 , by adding isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) to a final concentration of 0 . 4 mM . Following induction , the temperature was reduced to 25\u00b0C . Cells were harvested 16 hr later , and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) containing deoxyribonuclease I from bovine pancreas , and stored at \u221280\u00b0C . Unless stated , the following steps were carried out at 4\u00b0C . Cells were thawed and disrupted at 32 kpsi ( Constant Systems , UK ) . Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 30 , 000 x\u00a0g for 30 min , and membranes were isolated by ultracentrifugation at 230 , 000 x\u00a0g for 120 min . Membranes were resuspended in PBS using a dounce homogeniser , flash frozen , and stored at \u221280\u00b0C . Thawed membranes were diluted with 1x PBS ( 10 mL per gram of membrane ) , 20 mM imidazole ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 1% n-Dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside ( DDM ) and left to solubilise for 60 min , stirring . Non-solubilised membranes were removed by ultracentrifugation at 230 , 000 g for 60 min . Nickel-NTA resin ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) was added to the sample , using a ratio of 1 mL resin per gram of membrane , and left to bind , stirring , for approximately 90 min . The resin was then packed into a glass econo-column ( BioRad , USA ) under gravity . The resin was washed with 20 column volumes ( CV ) of wash buffer ( 1x PBS , 20 mM imidazole ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 150 mM NaCl and 0 . 05% DDM ) . The resin was further washed with 10CV of wash buffer containing 30 mM imidazole . The bound GFP-SH1446 fusion protein was eluted with wash buffer containing 250 mM imidazole . The eluent was combined with an equivalent concentration of hexa histidine tagged TEV protease and dialysed overnight against 20 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 0 . 03% DDM . The cleaved protein was filtered using a 0 . 22 \u03bcm filter ( Millipore , USA ) and passed through a Ni-NTA 5 mL HisTrap column ( GE Healthcare ) to remove uncleaved GFP-SH1446 protein and TEV protease . The flow through was collected and concentrated to 300 \u03bcl using a 50 kDa MWCO concentrator ( Vivapsin 20 , Sartorius AG ) and applied to a size exclusion column ( Superdex 200 10/30 , GE Healthcare ) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 0 . 03% DDM . Fractions containing purified SH1446 protein were pooled and concentrated to a final concentration of 15\u201320 mg . ml\u22121 . For expression and purification of TnaA , overnight cultures were grown in LB at 37\u00b0C , 200 rpm . 1 L of LB was inoculated 1:50 with the starter culture and grown to an OD600nm ~0 . 6\u20130 . 8 , target protein expression was induced with 0 . 001% arabinose . Following induction the culture was further incubated at 37\u00b0C for\u00a0~8 hr . Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 , 500 rpm for 15 min and resuspended in 35 mL resuspension buffer ( 50 mM Kpi , 20% Glycerol , 200 mM NaCl and 10 mL Imidazole , pH 7 . 8 ) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C . All subsequent steps were carried out at 4\u00b0C , for protein purification cells were thawed and lysed using sonication with 3 s pulsed and 7 s pause for 3mins . Lysates were clarified by centrifugation 25 , 000 rpm\u00a0~30 min . The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap column ( GE Healthcare ) and affinity purified on an AKTA Start ( GE Healthcare ) using a standard protocol as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions . Crystals of SH1446 were obtained in-meso phase . Briefly , concentrated protein was mixed with 9 . 9 monoacylglycerol ( Monoolein , Sigma-Aldrich ) at a protein:lipid ratio of 2:3 , in a mechanical syringe mixer at 20\u00b0C ( Ai and Caffrey , 2000 ) . 50 nL of mesophase and 800 nL of precipitant solution was dispensed on to a 96-well glass plate using an in meso robot ( Gryphon , Art Robbins Instruments ) . SH1446 S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH complex was crystallised in precipitant solution containing 26\u201327% ( v/v ) PEG 200 , 220 mM ( NH4 ) 2HPO4 , 110 mM sodium citrate ( pH 5 . 0 ) and 5 mM S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ( Peakdale Molecular ) and left overnight at 4\u00b0C , prior to crystallisation . Crystals appeared after 2\u20133 days , and grew to its maximum size after 10 days . Crystallisation wells were accessed using a tungsten-carbide glasscutter , and crystals were directly mounted onto 50\u2013100 \u03bcm microloops ( MiTeGen ) and flash frozen at 100 K . X-ray diffraction data were collected at ID23-2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility on a Pilatus3 2M detector with an exposure setting of 0 . 05 s with a 0 . 2\u00b0 oscillation range over 360\u00b0 Diffraction data was indexed and integrated in XDS ( Kabsch , 2010 ) and merged in Aimless ( Evans , 2011 ) . The ligand bound complex was solved by molecular replacement in PHASER ( McCoy et al . , 2007 ) using a modified search model of the bacterial peptide transporter from Streptococcus thermophilus , PepTSt ( Lyons et al . , 2014 ) , PDB: 4D2B . Iterative rounds of manual model building in COOT ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) followed by refinement in autoBUSTER ( Bricogne G . 2017 ) followed by refinement in Phenix ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) , resulted in a final model , which was validated using the Molprobity server ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . Additional difference density was observed in the binding site and matched the stereo chemical properties and size of S-CG3M3SH . Ligand restraints were generated using the Grade Web Server ( http://grade . globalphasing . org ) . Figures were prepared using PyMOL ( Schr\u00f6dinger , LLC ) . Purified SH1446 was detergent exchanged into n-Decyl-\u03b2-D-maltopyranoside ( DM , Anatrace ) using a size exclusion column ( Superdex 200 10/30 , GE Healthcare ) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 0 . 3% DM . Lipids ( POPE:POPG in a 3:1 ratio ) were mixed with the eluted protein at a ratio of 60:1 . The protein:lipid mixture was rapidly diluted with 50 mM KPO4 ( pH 7 . 0 ) buffer to below the CMC value of DM . Proteoliposomes were harvested by ultracentrifugation ( 234 , 000 xg ) for 120 min . The pellet was resuspended in 50 mM KPO4 and dialysed overnight against 3L of 50 mM KPO4 ( pH 7 . 0 ) . Proteoliposomes were recovered and subjected to three rounds of freeze thawing before storage at \u221280\u00b0C . Proteoliposomes were thawed and harvested by ultracentrifugation at 150 , 000 g . The resulting pellet was carefully resuspended in INSIDE buffer ( 120 mM KCl , 2 mM MgSO4 , 5 mM HEPES pH 6 . 8 ) and 1 mM pyranine ( trisodium 8-hydroxypyrene-1 , 3 , 6-trisulfonate ) . Proteoliposomes underwent eleven freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen before the sample was extruded through a 0 . 4 \u03bcm polycarbonate membrane and harvested by ultracentrifugation as before . Excess pyranine dye was removed with a Microspin G-25 column ( GE Healthcare ) pre-equilibrated with INSIDE buffer without pyranine . For the assay , proteoliposomes were diluted into OUTSIDE buffer ( 120 mM NaCl , 5 mM HEPES ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 2 mM MgSO4 ) . A Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer ( Agilent Technologies ) equipped with a cuvette and magnetic flea was used to carry out the transport assay . Dual fluorescence excitation was set to 460/415 nm with emission at 510 nm . Transport was initiated with 1 \u03bcM valinomycin , the resulting data was exported and analysed using Prism ( GraphPad Software ) . Transport data was normalised to one to facilitate comparison with data collected from multiple conditions . Proteoliposomes were harvested as before , the resulting pellet was resuspended in INSIDE buffer , subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen , extruded through a 0 . 4 \u03bcm polycarbonate membrane and harvested by ultracentrifugation once more . For the assay , proteoliposomes were diluted in external buffer ( 110 mM NaCl , 10 mM NaPO4 and 2 mM MgSO4 ) supplemented with 50 \u03bcM di-alanine peptide containing trace amounts of tritiated 3H-di-alanine ( specific activity 30 Ci/mmol ) and the competing substrate at increasing concentrations as indicated . Competition assays were performed at 30\u00b0C , samples were taken at specified time points and transport was stopped by addition of 2 mL H2O . Proteoliposomes were immediately filtered onto a 0 . 22 \u03bcm cellulose filter ( Merck Millipore ) using a vacuum manifold and subsequently washed twice more with 2 mL H2O . The amount of peptide transported into the liposomes was calculated based on the specific activity for each peptide as detailed by the manufacturer and counting efficiency for the radioisotope in Ultima Gold ( PerkinElmer ) counted in a Wallac scintillation counter ( 3H , 45% counting efficiency ) . Transport assays were performed a minimum of three times to generate an overall mean and S . E . M .

Some of these cells , including \u2018mononuclear phagocytes\u2019 , can reside within different tissues of the body , such as the lungs . Other less specialized cells , called monocytes , circulate in the bloodstream . It had long been thought that once these monocytes had taken up residence in a tissue , they could only develop into tissue-resident phagocytes . Several researchers , however , recently reported that monocytes can also reside within tissues without becoming more specialized . Nevertheless , it remained unclear what these cells did when they were in these tissues . Rodero , Poupel , Loyher et al . investigated the activities of tissue-resident monocytes found in the lungs of mice . First , mice were genetically engineered to produce fluorescent markers that meant that their monocytes could be easily distinguished from the mononuclear phagocytes in their lungs when viewed under a microscope . Rodero , Poupel , Loyher et al . then showed that the monocytes and the other mononuclear phagocytes localized to different regions of the lung . Further experiments showed that these two groups of cells also moved around the lungs in different ways . The tissue-resident monocytes surveyed both the blood vessels and airways , while the other tissue-resident mononuclear phagocytes only surveyed the airways . These findings show that lung-resident monocytes perform a different role to those found in the bloodstream . The findings also open the way to improving our understanding of what tissue-resident monocytes do in other organs , and in healthy or diseased animals .", "source": "Monocytes are phagocytic effector cells in the blood and precursors of resident and inflammatory tissue macrophages . The aim of the current study was to analyse and compare their contribution to innate immune surveillance of the lung in the steady state with macrophage and dendritic cells ( DC ) . ECFP and EGFP transgenic reporters based upon Csf1r and Cx3cr1 distinguish monocytes from resident mononuclear phagocytes . We used these transgenes to study the migratory properties of monocytes and macrophages by functional imaging on explanted lungs . Migratory monocytes were found to be either patrolling within large vessels of the lung or locating at the interface between lung capillaries and alveoli . This spatial organisation gives to monocytes the property to capture fluorescent particles derived from both vascular and airway routes . We conclude that monocytes participate in steady-state surveillance of the lung , in a way that is complementary to resident macrophages and DC , without differentiating into macrophages . \n The mononuclear phagocytic system ( MPS ) consists of a family of cells\u2014including monocytes , macrophages , and dendritic cells ( DC ) \u2014that are derived from common committed bone marrow progenitors and perform related functions ( Hume , 2006; Hashimoto et al . , 2011 ) . The lung is a mucosal surface of the body , exposed constantly to inhaled particles including pathogens , as well as other potential toxins ( Nelson et al . , 2012 ) . Lung mononuclear phagocytes have been shown to adapt specifically to the lung environment , and contribute to lung homeostasis , scavenging , and immune surveillance ( Kopf et al . , 2014; The lungs at the frontlines of immunity , 2014 ) . Monocytes were originally considered to be circulating precursors of macrophages , participating in renewal of tissue-resident macrophages in steady state and recruited in large numbers in response to inflammatory stimuli ( Auffray et al . , 2009; Geissmann et al . , 2010 ) . Fate mapping approaches and parabiosis experiments have been used to argue that tissue-resident macrophages such as alveolar macrophages ( AM ) may be seeded from the yolk sac or foetal liver during embryonic development and can be maintained in the absence of monocyte recruitment ( Guilliams et al . , 2013; Hashimoto et al . , 2013; Yona et al . , 2013 ) . However , others have suggested the models used in these studies may disturb the availability of the key growth factor , CSF1 , and do not necessarily reflect the steady state ( Jenkins and Hume , 2014 ) . Whatever their normal contribution to the resident macrophage pool , monocytes derived from the bone marrow ( Chow et al . , 2011 ) and spleen ( Swirski et al . , 2009 ) can clearly replenish tissue macrophages after their cytotoxic depletion . Beyond this precursor role , monocytes carry out specific effector functions during infection ( Serbina et al . , 2008 ) and may be involved in steady-state tissue surveillance by capturing and transporting antigen from tissue to lymphoid organs ( Jakubzick et al . , 2013 ) . Macrophages isolated from different organs have distinct expression profiles which can be distinguished further if the cells are separated according to their surface markers ( Gautier et al . , 2013 ) . Unfortunately , no available surface marker is well correlated with any other marker , at either the protein or mRNA level ( Hume , 2008 , 2012; Hume et al . , 2010 ) , so the number of macrophage subsets definable by flow cytometry is essentially infinite ( Becher et al . , 2014 ) . Peripheral blood monocytes , on the other hand , can be subdivided into two broad functional classes . In the mouse , one subset called classical monocytes , expresses high levels of both Ly6C and the chemokine receptor CCR2 but a low level of the fractalkine ( CX3CL1 ) receptor CX3CR1 , while the second , the so-called non-classical monocytes , lacks Ly6C but expresses a high level of CX3CR1 ( Geissmann et al . , 2003 ) . In contrast to what we know about tissue macrophages , very little information is available on how monocytes behave after entering tissues . Myeloid-restricted fluorescent reporter genes based upon various lineage-restricted genes have been used in live imaging and functional genomics ( Hume , 2011 ) . A Csf1r-EGFP reporter gene serves as a definitive marker of MPS cells ( Sasmono et al . , 2003 ) , while a Cx3cr1-EGFP reporter labels the non-classical monocytes as well as subsets of tissue macrophages , including microglia , as well as a subset of natural killer ( NK ) lymphocytes ( Jung et al . , 2000 ) . The Itgax-YFP transgenic mouse was considered to provide a marker for classical \u2018dendritic cells\u2019 ( Lindquist et al . , 2004 ) and has been used to image so-called interstitial DC in the lung ( Looney et al . , 2011; Thornton et al . , 2012 ) . However , this reporter is rather uniformly expressed in tissue macrophages associated with mucosa and in the lung provides a generic MPS marker ( Hume , 2008 , 2012 ) . The deletion of a conserved distal element of the Csf1r promoter in the Csf1r-ECFPtg/+ mouse ( MacBlue ) ablates expression of a reporter gene in trophoblasts , osteoclasts , granulocytes , and many tissue macrophages ( Ovchinnikov et al . , 2008 ) . This deleted promoter was used to construct an amplified binary transgene in which Csf1r promoter elements direct the expression of gal4-VP16 , which in turn activates expression of a UAS-ECFP transgene . All blood monocytes in these MacBlue mice are strongly ECFP+ , whereas most tissue macrophages do not express the reporter protein ( Sauter et al . , 2014 ) . In the current study , we combined the myeloid-specific fluorescent reporters from MacBlue mice with either Cx3cr1gfp/+ or Itgax-YFP transgenic mice to support in situ imaging of lung monocyte cell trafficking and compare their phagocytic activity with that of resident mononuclear phagocytes . \n The MacBlue binary transgene ( Csf1r-gal4VP16/UAS-ECFP ) provides a unique marker of blood monocytes ( Jenkins and Hume , 2014 ) . To confirm this restricted expression in the lung , we generated MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/+ double transgenic mice . Two-photon laser scanning microscopy 3D-reconstruction of fresh explanted lung and histological section of cryo-preserved lungs from these mice identified distinct subsets with distinct morphologies and distributions within the organ ( Figure 1 ) . Stellar EGFP+ECFPneg cells were seen in the collagen membrane surrounding the lung pleura ( Figure 1A , B , green squares ) , deeper in the lung parenchyma with small round shapes or stellar shapes ( Figure 1B , green squares ) , and along the basal membranes of bronchial airways ( Figure 1C , green squares ) . The luminal side of airways and alveoli contained large round ECFP+ cells , likely AM ( Figure 1A\u2013D , pink squares ) . Smaller amoeboid-like ECFP+ cells were located in the interstitial space of the lung parenchyma ( Figure 1A\u2013D , purple squares ) . In overview , the pattern was consistent with previous evidence that the MacBlue ECFP transgene was expressed only in AM and monocyte-like cells , whereas most interstitial CX3CR1-EGFP expressing cells lacked expression . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 003 To establish the relationship between the cells that could be imaged in situ and their cellular phenotypes in MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/+ mice , we applied a panel of phenotypic markers including CD11b , CD115 , Ly6C , Ly6G , F4/80 , CD64 , CD11c , IAb , CD62L , NK1 . 1 , and SiglecF to discriminate four different subsets of the lung based on their EGFP/ECFP signature in the double transgenic line ( Figure 2A ) and compared them to blood populations ( Figure 2B and Table 1 ) . The lungs contained two ECFPbright populations , either EGFPbright or EGFPdim ( Figure 2A , purple gate ) resembling those observed in the blood ( Figure 2B ) . The CX3CR1-EGFPlow population was Ly6ChighCD11b+Ly6GnegF4/80intNK1 . 1negCD64+ ( blue gate ) in both the blood and the lungs ( Table 1 ) , consistent with identity as \u2018classical\u2019 Ly6Chigh monocytes ( Ly6Chigh Mo ) . The CX3CR1-EGFPhigh population was Ly6ClowCD11b+Ly6GnegF4/80intNK1 . 1negCD64+CD11c+ phenotype ( red gate ) , consistent with the phenotype of the Ly6Clow monocyte subset ( Ly6Clow Mo ) ( Guilliams et al . , 2014 ) . For both subsets , the expression of CD115 and CD62L was down modulated in the lung cells compared to their circulating counterparts . Downregulation of surface CSF1R ( CD115 ) could reflect the down-modulation of the surface receptor both by its ligand and by the many inflammatory stimuli present in the lung ( Sester et al . , 1999 ) . As expected , the lung also contained an ECFPhighEGFPneg signature ( pink gate ) . These cells were larger than monocytes and CD11b+Ly6CnegLy6GnegF4/80highNK1 . 1negCD11chighCD64highSiglecFhigh cells , consistent with their identity as AM . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 004Figure 2 .

AM , alveolar macrophages; NK , natural killer . The EGFPbright cells that lacked detectable ECFP ( green gate ) were a heterogeneous population . A subset of these cells in the lung labelled with NK1 . 1 , but many were CD64+F4/80+ ( Figure 2A and Table 1 ) interstitial and pleural macrophages , as observed on histological reconstruction ( Figure 1A ) . In the blood , the majority of ECFPnegEGFPbright cells labelled with NK1 . 1 ( Figure 2B ) , but the population also included immature myeloid cells as previously reported ( Sauter et al . , 2014 ) . Note that the ECFP transgene is expressed at low but detectable levels on granulocytes in the blood ( cyan gate ) ; these cells were positive for Ly6G ( Figure 2B , C ) . In summary , the binary expression of the two transgenic reporters in MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/+ mice permits the identification of monocytes in tissues , and their distinction from other mononuclear phagocyte subsets as well as from NK cells . In order to confirm the monocyte origin of the ECFP+EGFPlow/high -Ly6Chigh and -Ly6Clow monocytes , we generated parabionts of the double transgenic MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/+ with C57Bl6 mice and analysed the reconstitution after 1 month of parabiosis . In the lung , donor-derived ECFP cells displayed Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocyte phenotypes ( Figure 3A ) , were small in size , with ameboid-like morphologies , and were all located in the interalveolar space ( Figure 3B ) . By contrast , neither AM nor interstitial macrophages were derived from the donor as there was no expression of the transgenes in these compartments ( Figure 3B ) . The only cells expressing EGFP but not ECFP , were NK cells derived from the donor ( Figure 3A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 006Figure 3 . Interstitial ECFP+ cells are monocyte-derived .

( B ) Pictures compare different magnifications of lung cryo-section from MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/+ mouse ( left ) with C57Bl6 host parabiont with MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/+ mouse ( right ) . Up to six parabionts were prepared independently . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 006 To evaluate the function of chemotactic signals in the lung , we compared the frequency of the different subsets defined above in Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 , Cx3cr1\u2212/\u2212 , and Ccr2\u2212/\u2212Cx3cr1\u2212/\u2212 ( dKO ) mice in the blood and the lung ( Figure 4 ) . Consistent with published studies ( Kim et al . , 2011; Yona et al . , 2013 ) , the frequency of circulating Ly6Chigh monocytes was similar in wild-type ( WT ) and Cx3cr1\u2212/\u2212 mice . By contrast , the absence of CX3CR1 did impact on the yield of Ly6Chigh cells in the lung . As expected , this subset was strongly reduced in Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 mice and dKO mice in both the blood and the lungs ( Figure 4B , C ) . Ly6Clow monocyte frequency was similar in Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 mice but significantly reduced in Cx3cr1\u2212/\u2212 and dKO mice in both the blood and the lungs compared to WT mice ( Figure 4B , C ) . AM frequencies were similar in all strains ( Figure 4C ) consistent with their reported monocyte-independent homeostasis ( Guilliams et al . , 2013 ) . Together , these results showed that CCR2 and CX3CR1 control the steady-state trafficking and survival of both Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocyte-derived cells in the lungs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 007Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 007 Having demonstrated the utility of the MacBlue marker to define monocyte-derived cells , we performed live imaging on explanted lungs to characterize the behaviour of these cells ( Figure 5A and Video 1 ) . Small interstitial ECFP+ cells ( area 61 \u00b1 17 \u03bcm\u00b2 ) with an amoeboid-like shape displayed a bimodal behaviour: they were either highly motile , going backwards and forwards between the alveoli , or relatively sessile with protrusions extending towards the lumen of the alveoli ( Figure 5B\u2013C and Videos 1 and 2 ) . Based upon these distinct behaviours , we defined \u2018patrolling\u2019 cells with high velocity ( 10 \u00b1 4 . 6 \u03bcm/min ) and a low arrest coefficient ( 14 \u00b1 13% ) and interstitial ECFP+ cells with lower velocity ( 4 \u00b1 2 . 2 \u03bcm/min ) and a higher arrest coefficient ( 64 \u00b1 21% ) ( Figure 5C ) . Intravenous injection of rhodamine dextran prior to mouse sacrifice permitted , during a short time frame before vascular leakage , to determine that fast moving patrolling ECFP+ cells were located inside large vessels , whereas slow motile ECFP+ cells appeared to be extravascular but in close contact with the vasculature ( Video 3 ) . Aside from monocytes , large round ECFPbright AM ( area 121 \u00b1 23 \u03bcm\u00b2 ) were detected in the alveolar lumina , leisurely surveying the surface of the airways with a velocity of 2 \u00b1 1 . 5 \u03bcm/min and a high arrest coefficient ( 76 \u00b1 19% ) ( Video 4 ) . Interstitial EGFP+ cells also migrated slowly , with comparable velocity and arrest coefficient to AM ( Figure 5C ) . To determine their motility coefficient ( MC ) , we plotted the mean square displacement as a function of the square root of time . The MC of patrolling monocytes was 30-fold higher than the MC of interstitial ECFP+ cells ( 39 vs 1 . 3 \u03bcm\u00b2/min ) and a further fourfold higher than the MC of AM ( 0 . 3 \u03bcm\u00b2/min ) ( Figure 5D ) . This higher MC in interstitial ECFP+ monocytes was attributable to the protrusive activity and slow displacement suggesting scanning of the interalveolar space ( Video 2 ) .

In overview , while AM survey the luminal side of the alveoli , interstitial monocyte-derived cells survey the lung tissue through either active patrolling in the vasculature or protrusive activity toward the alveolar space . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 008Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 014 In order to determine the molecular mechanism involved in the steady-state lung surveillance , we analysed the behaviour of lung mononuclear phagocytes in MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/gfp mice ( Figure 6A and Video 7 ) . The absence of functional CX3CR1 did not change the arrest coefficient ( Figure 6B ) but did slightly reduce the MC of patrolling cells ( Figure 6C ) . As might be anticipated given their lack of CX3CR1 expression , AM behaviour was also comparable in WT and Cx3cr1\u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 6B\u2013C ) . On the other hand , deletion of the CX3CR1 clearly altered the behaviour of the interstitial ECFP+ cells , which showed a greatly increased arrest coefficient and reduced MC ( Figure 6B\u2013C ) . The scanning behaviour was also strongly affected . In the absence of CX3CR1 , the remaining interstitial ECFP+ cells present had greatly reduced protrusive activity , as indicated by increased global \u2018sphericity\u2019 ( Figure 6D , E ) and reduced sphericity variation ( Figure 6F ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 015Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 016 Lung DC defined by CD11c expression have been previously shown to participate in antigen uptake ( Thornton et al . , 2012 ) . CD11c is expressed on all tissue macrophages in the lung , but is absent from monocytes . To compare the roles of these cells in particle clearance , we combined MacBlue with the Itgax-YFP transgene ( MacBlue\u00d7Itgax-YFP ) and again compared the fluorescent signatures of different mononuclear phagocyte populations ( Figure 7A ) . According to previous phenotyping , Ly6Chigh monocytes were CD11b+Ly6G\u2212SiglecF-IAblowCD64lowLy6Chigh , Ly6Clow monocytes were CD11b+Ly6G\u2212SiglecF-IAblowCD64lowLy6Clow , interstitial macrophages were CD11b+Ly6G\u2212SiglecF-IAbhighCD64+ , and AM were CD11blowCD11chighSiglecFhighCD64+ . Based upon published markers ( Guilliams et al . , 2014 ) , two sets of classical myeloid DC have been defined: CD11b+ DC that were CD11b+CD11c+Ly6G\u2212SiglecF-IAbhighCD64\u2212CD24+ and CD11b\u2212 DC that were CD11b\u2212CD11c+Ly6G\u2212SiglecF-IAbhighCD64\u2212CD24+CD103+ ( Figure 7A ) . We determined the mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) of EGFP , ECFP , and YFP reporters from the MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/+ and MacBlue\u00d7Itgax-YFP in these subsets ( Figure 7B ) . EGFP and ECFP fluorescent reporter expressions were mainly restricted to lung macrophage and monocyte subsets as previously described ( Figure 2 ) . Although CD11c mRNA and surface protein are expressed widely among tissue macrophages in the lung , YFP expression was mainly restricted to the defined classical DC subsets with a brighter expression for CD11b\u2212 DC ( Figure 7C ) . Interestingly , AM only express the MacBlue transgene and despite expression of CD11c protein on their surface , YFP was detectable in only a small subset ( Figure 7B\u2013C ) . Thus the combination of these different transgenes permits the distinction of lung mononuclear phagocytes and lung DC . AM represented the most abundant mononuclear phagocyte subset of the lung ( Figure 7D ) . Lung monocytes represented the second main mononuclear phagocyte subset and were even more numerous than interstitial macrophages , CD11b+ DC and CD11b\u2212CD103+ DC ( Figure 7D ) . Histological analysis of a lung section of MacBlue\u00d7Itgax-YFP showed that YFPbright cells were mainly located along bronchial airways and poorly distributed in the alveolar space in contrast to ECFP+ monocytes and AM ( Figure 7E ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 017Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 017 Particle size and the physical properties of inhaled particles are critical in the uptake by lung phagocytes and trafficking to regional lymph nodes ( Jakubzick et al . , 2008; Blank et al . , 2013 ) . We hypothesized that regional segregation of monocytes and classical DC could be also important in antigen uptake . We inoculated mice with fluorescent beads either by intravenous or airway routes and compared the proportion of phagocytic cells in different lung subsets 4 hr after bead inoculation ( Figure 8A ) . After i . v . inoculation , only monocytic cells appeared to have taken up particles ( Figure 8B\u2013C ) . After airway inhalation , AM were the main phagocytic subset ( Figure 8B\u2013C ) , but particles were also detected among interstitial cells . The numbers of phagocytic Ly6Clow and Ly6Chigh monocytes were significantly higher compared to the number of phagocytic DC after airway inhalation , showing that lung monocytes are the only subsets that effectively capture both blood-derived and airway-derived fluorescent particles ( Figure 8C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 018Figure 8 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 018 In order to further discriminate lung monocytes from circulating monocytes , we performed blood/tissue partitioning using in vivo CD45 labelling as reported by others ( Anderson et al . , 2014; Girgis et al . , 2014 ) . This approach was reported to be technically challenging due to the vascular permeability of the lung ( Jakubzick et al . , 2013 ) . Lung mononuclear phagocyte subsets and neutrophils were labelled in different proportions ( Figure 9A ) . AM were not labelled , confirming that the antibody did not reach the airways . Overall , 27% of interstitial macrophages , 12% of CD11b+ DC , and only 1% of CD11b\u2212 DC were labelled , suggesting a distinct location of these subsets related to the vasculature ( Figure 9A ) . Up to 90% of Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow lung monocytes were labelled by the anti-CD45 antibody in vivo; however , the MFI was significantly lower compared to that of blood monocytes ( Figure 9B ) . We excluded that this effect was due to collagen treatment , as similar results were obtained in non-digested lungs ( Figure 9B ) . Furthermore , the phenotype of both Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocytes was slightly distinct from their circulating counterparts . Indeed lung monocytes displayed reduced expression of Ly6C , CD62L , and CD115 as previously observed , in addition to a higher level of CD11b , whereas only Ly6Clow monocytes displayed higher CD11c expression ( Figure 9C ) . The same differences were observed in monocytes isolated from lung without enzymatic digestion ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that monocytes can be either extravascular but in close vicinity to the vessels or still intravascular and trapped in capillaries with reduced access to the bloodstream and submitted to the lung environment . MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/+ mice were inoculated intravenously 5 min before sacrifice with a mixture of 10 \u00b5m and 0 . 2 \u00b5m red fluorescent beads to differentiate large vessel areas identified by the presence of both 10 \u00b5m and 0 . 2 \u00b5m beads , and lung capillary areas identified by only 0 . 2 \u00b5m beads ( Figure 9D ) . In large vessels , ECFP+ cells were mainly round shaped , whereas in the vicinity of capillaries , interstitial ECFP+ cells displayed an elongated or amoeboid-like shape ( Figure 9D ) . Confocal analysis of the microvascular area using CD31 staining showed that interstitial ECFP+ cells locate at the interface between the capillaries and the alveoli either intra- or extravascularly ( Figure 9E and Video 8 ) . To confirm that this positioning allows the sampling of particles inoculated by the airways route , we performed in vivo CD45 staining of monocytes that had captured beads 4 hr after intranasal inoculation ( Figure 9F ) . CD45 in vivo labelling was exactly the same for both Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocytes that had captured the beads compared to non-phagocytic monocytes ( Figure 9F ) . This result confirmed that lung monocytes are strategically positioned at the interface between the bloodstream and airways to survey both compartments . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 019Figure 9 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 020 \n Jakubzick et al . ( 2013 ) recently reported that monocytes enter and survey non-lymphoid organs ( such as the lungs ) at steady state . How this property differs from the already known functions of AM and DC was still unknown . Fluorescent myeloid-specific reporter transgenic mice have been widely used to study the behaviour of myeloid cells in vivo , although no transgenic reporter is restricted to a particular myeloid lineage ( Hume , 2011 ) . LysM reporters can be used to track either neutrophils or monocytes ( Faust et al . , 2000 ) . A wide diversity of cell subsets are labelled in the Cx3cr1gfp/+ system , including NK cells , which can be excluded only with a specific \u03b3c-deficient background ( Auffray et al . , 2007 ) . Similarly , the MacGreen ( Csf1r-EGFP ) transgene enables labelling of a wide range of mononuclear phagocytes as well as granulocytes ( Sasmono et al . , 2003 ) . The MacBlue binary transgene , based upon a deleted Csf1r promoter , produced a transgenic line in which the reporter gene is extinguished in the majority of mature tissue macrophages and greatly reduced in granulocytes ( Ovchinnikov et al . , 2008; Sauter et al . , 2014 ) . Despite the fact that ECFP expression is not directly related to the level of Csf1r mRNA , it provides a unique marker of cells that have recently derived from monocytes . In the current study , we intercrossed Cx3cr1gfp/+ and MacBlue mice to obtain an additional dimension of resolution and specificity . Monocytes were easily distinguishable from other subsets due to their common expression of ECFP . The differential expression of EGFP enabled a further distinction between Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocytes . Although our imaging approach did not allow us to distinguish between the two monocyte subsets , the shape , size , tissue localization , and behaviour of the ECFP+ cells provided a unique opportunity to track lung tissue mononuclear phagocytes and to compare their migratory patterns . The dual reporter also avoids potential artefacts created by the \u03b3c-deficient background excluding NK cells which we have shown to be highly represented in the CX3CR1-GFP+ fraction within the lungs . The combination of CCR2 and CX3CR1 deficient mice and parabionts permitted a more precise characterization of the nature and origin of the different subsets and confirmed that interstitial ECFP+ were monocyte-derived according to the proposed unified nomenclature ( Guilliams et al . , 2014 ) . Krummel\u2019s group previously performed functional imaging of lung DC using the Itgax-YFP reporter ( Thornton et al . , 2012 ) . The combination of this reporter with the MacBlue mouse confirmed that interstitial monocyte-derived cells were distinct from lung DC . Histological analysis showed that monocyte-derived cells and DC share the surveillance activity through distinct regional distribution , the former located in the alveolar space at the interface with the bloodstream and the latter near larger bronchial airways . In vivo CD45 labelling added a new dimension of regional segregation between AM , interstitial macrophages , CD11b+ DC , CD11b\u2212 DC , and lung monocytes . This specific regional segregation at steady state is likely the result of the rapid circulation of monocytes that arrest constitutively in the capillaries of the alveolar space with relatively short life span ( Jakubzick et al . , 2013 ) , whereas DC are slow motile cells ( Thornton et al . , 2012 ) . Of course regional segregation is likely less marked in the allergic asthma model for which important DC recruitment was observed in the vicinity of the alveoli , likely originating from monocytes ( Jakubzick et al . , 2008 ) , where they exert longer transepithelial dendrites formation toward airways ( Thornton et al . , 2012 ) . Our data demonstrate that the interstitial space of the lung is intensively surveyed by monocytes actively migrating or extending processes . The strategic positioning of lung monocytes at the interface allows for efficient capture of both blood and airway-derived particles . Four hours after intranasal inoculation , fluorescent particles remained undetectable in the mediastinal lymph nodes , as previously observed ( Jakubzick et al . , 2008; data not shown ) , however after 1 d , DC seem to prevail over monocytes in the transport of the inhaled particles . This suggests that the majority of monocytes may scavenge particles to clean up the tissue and filter the blood , whereas the majority of DC aim to transport antigen to the draining lymph node . Due to the vascular permeability of the lung , it is challenging to address the blood/tissue partitioning of the subsets ( Jakubzick et al . , 2013 ) . We combined in vivo CD45 labelling and confocal imaging to determine the precise location of lung monocytes ( Anderson et al . , 2014; Girgis et al . , 2014 ) . We determined that lung permeability does not allow it to be definitely concluded that lung monocytes share their time either intra- or extravascularly or even both . However , we showed that lung monocytes have a slightly differentiated phenotype compared to the circulating monocytes with a downregulation of CD115 and CD62L and an upregulation of CD11b and CD11c . Secondly , the proportions of Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocytes were different in the lungs compared to the blood . Finally , monocyte localization in the vicinity of the bloodstream allows them to capture beads inoculated via the intranasal route . Several studies used in situ imaging of the lung ( Kreisel et al . , 2010; Looney et al . , 2011 ) , but it is likely that working on lung explants may somehow affect the dynamics of the studied cells . For instance , fast circulating monocytes in the blood flow could not be observed . Nevertheless , we still observed high velocity patrolling cells that were present within large vessels , suggesting that this migration is independent of the blood flow . This approach provides at least the advantage of better stability without breathing constraints and avoids any accumulation of inflammatory monocytes due to inflammation . Other monocyte behaviour might be observed using in vivo imaging . By contrast to the CX3CR1-dependence of endothelium patrolling ( Auffray et al . , 2007 ) as well as transepithelial dendrite formation in the gut ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) , the patrolling activity of interstitial monocytes in the lung was unaffected by the absence of this receptor , whereas their scanning activity was severely impaired . Kim et al . showed that CX3CL1 was expressed by the epithelial cells of bronchioles and in the alveolar space using the CX3CL1-RFP reporters ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) , arguing in favour of the role of this axis in protrusive activity of the CX3CR1+ monocyte-derived cells . Because CX3CR1 is an important survival pathway , it is unclear whether these modifications are related to defects in chemotactic signal or cell survival . We did not observe defects in phagocytosis in CX3CR1-deficient mice ( unpublished data ) , suggesting that the recently recruited monocytes are functional , arguing in favour of a role of CX3CR1 in their survival ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . Overall , our study provided important fundamental insights into the behaviour of tissue monocytes during the process of immune surveillance in comparison to resident macrophages and DC in a key biological tissue . We concluded that tissue monocytes represent a major first line phagocytic compartment in comparison to DC . Monocyte-derived cells developed an organized distribution at the interface between blood and airways with a specific pattern of movements in the lungs to enable them to rapidly detect danger , trigger inflammation , capture antigen , and undergo subsequent immune response . Understanding these activities is a key step towards improving the treatment of a wide range of inflammatory diseases and also vaccination strategies targeting the route of antigen uptake . \n Cx3cr1-GFP-Kin ( Cx3cr1gfp/+ ) or Itgax-YFP transgenic mice ( CD11c-YFP ) ( Lindquist et al . , 2004 ) and Csf1r-Gal4VP16/UAS-ECFP ( MacBlue ) ( Ovchinnikov et al . , 2008 ) were intercrossed to generate Cx3cr1gfp/+\u00d7Csf1r-Gal4VP16/UAS-ECFP mice herein called MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/+ or MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/gfp , and MacBlue\u00d7Itgax-YFP , respectively . These new strains were bred in the Nouvelle Animalerie Commune animal facility at Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re . Cx3cr1gfp/+-Ccr2rfp/+ mice were kindly provided by Israel Charo ( Gladstone Institute , San Francisco , CA , USA ) ( Saederup et al . , 2010 ) to generate Cx3cr1gfp/gfp-Ccr2rfp/+ , Cx3cr1gfp/+-Ccr2rfp/- , and Cx3cr1gfp/gfp-Ccr2rfp/rfp mouse strains . All mice were used between 8 and 12 weeks of age . C57Bl6 female host parabionts were generated with MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/+females and analysed after 1 month of parabiosis . Blood leukocyte chimerism was evaluated 2 weeks after surgery , and showed a T cell chimerism of 50 \u00b1 10% . In these settings , monocyte chimerism from B6 to MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/+ was around 37 \u00b1 14% and MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/+ to B6 was reduced to 14 \u00b1 13% . All experiment protocols were approved by the French animal experimentation and ethics committee and validated by Service Protection et Sant\u00e9 Animales , Environnement ( no . A-75-2065 ) . Sample sizes were chosen to ensure the reproducibility of the experiments and according to the 3Rs of animal ethics regulation . A total of 1011 FluoroSpheres carboxylate\u2013modified microspheres ( 200 nm ) ( Invitrogen , Eugene , OR , USA ) were inoculated either by intravenous or airway routes . Phagocytosis by lung subsets was analysed 4 hr after inoculation by flow cytometry . Bead inhalation was performed by loading a 10 \u00b5l drop of NaCl 0 . 9% bead solution in each nostril of mice anaesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine/xylazine ( 100 and 10 mg/kg body weight , respectively ) . Mice for which bead inhalation failed have been excluded from the analysis . For in vivo CD45 labelling , mice were injected intravenously with 1 \u00b5g of anti-CD45 ( clone 30-F11 ) . Mice were sacrificed 2 min after blood was drawn . Lungs were harvested and bathed in a large volume of PBS to dilute free antibody . Flow cytometry was performed with the flow cytometer FACScanto or Fortessa ( BD , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) and DIVA Flow Cytometry acquisition software , and was analysed with FlowJo software ( Tree Star , Ashland , OR , USA ) . After blood was drawn via retro-orbital puncture with heparin , the mouse lung vasculature was gently flushed with an intracardiac injection of PBS until complete blood clearance . For in vivo CD45 staining experiments , the lung vasculature was not flushed . Lungs were then harvested and digested in RPMI medium ( Gibco , Invitrogen , Cergy Pontoise , France ) with 1 mg/ml collagenase IV ( Sigma , St Quentin Fallavier , France ) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and/or directly ( without collagenase incubation ) dissociated through a 70 \u03bcm-pore cell strainer ( Becton Dickinson , Rungis , France ) to obtain the cell suspension . Similarly , for some experiments blood was or was not incubated with 1 mg/ml collagenase IV . For antibody staining , 50 \u03bcL of cell suspension was incubated with 1 \u03bcg/mL purified anti-CD16/32 ( 2 . 4G2 ) ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and for an additional 20 min with the appropriate dilution of specific antibodies . The panel of antibodies used was: anti-CD11b ( clone M1/70 ) , anti-Ly6C ( clone AL-21 ) , anti-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 ) , anti-NK1 . 1 ( clone PK136 ) , anti-CD45 ( clone 30-F11 ) , anti-CD11c ( clone HL3 ) , anti-I-Ab ( clone AF6-120-1 ) , anti-CD 62L ( clone MEL-14 ) , anti-SiglecF ( clone E50-2440 ) , anti-CD24 ( cloneM1/69 ) , anti-CD103 clone ( M290 ) , rat IgG2b isotype control ( BD Biosciences ) , F4/80 ( clone BM8 ) , CD115 ( clone AFS98 ) , rat IgG2a isotype control ( clone eBr2a; eBioscience , San Diego , CA , USA ) , and anti-CD64 ( clone X54-5/7 . 1 . 1 ) ( BioLegend , San Diego , CA , USA ) . After incubation , cell suspensions were washed once in 0 . 5% BSA/2 mM EDTA in PBS and analysed directly by flow cytometry . For blood samples , erythrocytes were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 0 . 15 M NH4Cl , 0 . 01 mM KHCO3 and 0 . 1 mM EDTA and resuspended in 0 . 5% BSA/2 mM EDTA in PBS . FMO staining controls ( full minus one ) have been performed for all sets of experiment and are indicated in dot plots or histogram plots when necessary . Specific FMO gating for alveolar macrophages was required due to their bright autofluorescence . Absolute numbers were calculated by adding to each vial a fixed number ( 10 , 000 ) of non-fluorescent 10-\u00b5m Polybead Carboxylate Microspheres ( Polysciences , Niles , IL , USA ) according to the formula: no . cells = ( no . acquired cells \u00d7 10 , 000 ) / ( no . acquired beads ) . Briefly , organs were harvested and fixed in 10% formalin for 4 hr then incubated in 30% sucrose-PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C before being embedded in Tissue\u2013Tek OCT compound ( Sakura Finetek , Alphen aan den Rijn , Netherlands ) and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C . Sectioning was completed on a HM550 Cryostat ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) at \u221220\u00b0C and 5 \u03bcm sections were collected on Superfrost Plus Slides ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use . Vascular staining using beads was performed on histological sections of lung from MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/+ mice injected 5 min before sacrifice with a mixture of 10 \u00b5m Polybead Carboxylate Microspheres and 0 . 2 \u00b5m FluoroSpheres carboxylate . Lung sections were rehydrated with PBS for 10 min , counterstained and mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI ( 4 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Vector Laboratories ) . Imaging used a Zeiss Axio Microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . CD31 vascular staining was performed on lung cryo-sections from MacBlue\u00d7Cx3cr1gfp/+ mice . A first blocking step was performed with 3% BSA/PBS solution for 30 min . Slides were then incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C with the primary antibody rat anti-mouse CD31 ( 4 \u00b5g/ml ) ( clone MEC 13 . 3; Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA , USA ) or the isotype control ( 4 \u00b5g/ml ) ( clone eBR2a; eBioscience ) . Slides were next incubated with Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit ( SP-2001; Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA , USA ) and then stained with a biotinylated donkey anti-rat IgG at 3 \u00b5g/ml for 30 min at room temperature . After three ( 5 min ) washes in PBS , slides were incubated with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin at 2 . 6 \u00b5g/ml for 30 min at room temperature ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , West Grove , PA , USA ) . Slides were counterstained and mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI and analysed by using a Zeiss LSM 710 NLO confocal microscope coupled with 458 nm , 488 nm , and 543 nm lasers to detect ECFP , EGFP , and Cy3 simultaneously on three photomultipliers . Acquisition settings were identical for both isotype and CD31 staining . Volume rendering was performed using Imaris software ( Bitplane , Zurich , Switzerland ) and parameters were set according to CD31 isotype staining . Freshly explanted lungs were immobilized in an imaging chamber perfused with oxygenated ( 95% O2 plus 5% CO2 ) RPMI medium containing 10% FCS . The local temperature was monitored and maintained at 37\u00b0C . For some experiments , 2 MkDa rhodamine dextran was injected intravenously 1 min before euthanasia and lung vasculature was ligatured to reduce leakage of the dye . The two-photon laser scanning microscopy ( TPLSM ) set-up used consisted of a Zeiss LSM 710 NLO multiphoton microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) coupled to a Ti:Sapphire crystal laser ( Coherent Chameleon Ultra , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) , which provides 140 fs pulses of NIR light , selectively tunable between 680 and 1080 nm , and an acousto-optic modulator to control laser power . The system included three external non-descanned detectors that enabled the simultaneous recording of three fluorescent channels with a combination of two dichroic mirrors ( 565 nm and 690 nm ) , 565/610 and 500/550 bandpass filters , and a 485 lowpass filter . The excitation wavelength was 870 nm . Cell motility was measured every 30 s by five consecutive 3 \u03bcm z spacing stacks ( total thickness of 12 \u03bcm ) with a plan apochromat \u00d7 20 ( NA = 1 ) water immersion objective . Fluorescent cells were monitored over time with three-dimensional automatic tracking and manual correction with Imaris software ( Bitplane ) . The different cell subsets were defined according to the fluorescent signature , the size , the shape , the localization , and the behaviour . Typically AM are ECFPbright , large , round , and sessile cells located in the lumen of alveoli . Patrolling monocytes are ECFP+ and small with an amoeboid-like shape displaying strong displacements in the interalveolar space . Interstitial monocyte-derived cells are ECFP+ sessile cells displaying protrusive activity in the interalveolar space . Interstitial EGFP+ are either small and round ( likely NK ) in the lung alveolar space , or dendritic-shaped in the pleura and along airways . Cells that could not be tracked for more than 2 min were not considered . The arrest coefficient was defined as the proportion of time each cell\u2019s instantaneous velocity ( calculated for every 30 s interval ) was less than 2 \u03bcm/min . The MC was determined on a 2D-based analysis by z projection of the 3D stacks , using the formula ( x\u00b2/4 t ) ( where x represents the slope of the mean displacement as a function of the square root of time ) ( Cahalan and Parker , 2008 ) ( see statistical section ) . Coefficient of sphericity variation was determined by calculating the coefficient of variation with Graphpad Prism ( Graphpad , San Diego , CA , USA ) of the sphericity determined for each cell on 10 consecutive planes ( 5 min ) . Velocity and sphericity were determined using Imaris ( Bitplane ) . The acquisition and analysis protocols for all experimental conditions to be compared were identical . All statistical analyses were performed with Graphpad Prism . For intravital analysis of cell behaviour , each sample value was first tested for Gaussian distribution by the D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test . Accordingly , multigroup comparison tests were performed by one-way ANOVA for parametric distribution followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison test or Kruskal\u2013Wallis test for non-parametric distributions , followed by Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison test . For simple comparison analysis , Student\u2019s t test was performed to compare parametric distribution and Mann\u2013Whitney rank sum tests were performed to compare non-parametric distribution . For MC measurement , the slope of the mean displacement as a function of the square root of time ( Cahalan and Parker , 2008 ) was calculated by linear regression statistical analysis . Linearity was considered significant for r\u00b2 >0 . 9 . Symbols used: * , p<0 . 05; ** , p<0 . 01; *** , p<0 . 001 ."}

The start of the transcription process features two milestones: first , an enzyme called RNA Polymerase II starts the process; shortly afterwards , however , the process pauses and only starts again when other proteins are recruited . This provides two levels of control over the production of messenger RNA and , it also allows the transcription process to be interrupted in order to study the rate of transcription . Here , Jonkers , Kwak and Lis used two drugs to block either the start of transcription or the release from the paused state in mouse cells . Both drugs prevented new transcription and disrupted about 95% of the total number of genes . However , RNA Polymerase II that was already copying DNA could continue to copy , and did so at an average rate of 2000 bases per minute . Transcription rates were , however , shown to vary between different genes\u2014highly active genes are transcribed faster . Transcription rates also varied within individual genes , with the enzyme accelerating as it moves along the gene . This suggests that the transcription machinery , including other proteins that improve the enzyme\u2019s efficiency , are recruited or modified after transcription has already started , and that these proteins help the enzyme to reach its maximum transcription speed . Other factors also affected the transcription rate: the genetic code is written in four letters\u2014A , C , G and T\u2014and genes that contained more Cs and Gs were transcribed slower than those with lots of As and Ts . Genes also contain regions called exons that code for proteins , and regions called introns that do not: Jonkers , Kwak and Lis found that genes with lots of exons were transcribed slower . Furthermore , DNA is wrapped around proteins into a compacted structure , and genes that had certain chemical markings added to these proteins were transcribed faster . The work of Jonkers , Kwak and Lis is the first in-depth look at how transcription is affected by gene structure , and leads the way to uncovering how transcription rates throughout genes are regulated to influence production of messenger RNA .", "source": "Production of mRNA depends critically on the rate of RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) elongation . To dissect Pol II dynamics in mouse ES cells , we inhibited Pol II transcription at either initiation or promoter-proximal pause escape with Triptolide or Flavopiridol , and tracked Pol II kinetically using GRO-seq . Both inhibitors block transcription of more than 95% of genes , showing that pause escape , like initiation , is a ubiquitous and crucial step within the transcription cycle . Moreover , paused Pol II is relatively stable , as evidenced from half-life measurements at \u223c3200 genes . Finally , tracking the progression of Pol II after drug treatment establishes Pol II elongation rates at over 1000 genes . Notably , Pol II accelerates dramatically while transcribing through genes , but slows at exons . Furthermore , intergenic variance in elongation rates is substantial , and is influenced by a positive effect of H3K79me2 and negative effects of exon density and CG content within genes . \n Many steps throughout the transcription cycle of RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) can be regulated , and modulation of any step has the potential to alter the timing and output of mRNA production . After initiation of Pol II , transcription regulation is mediated mostly by the dynamics of Pol II elongation . For example , +20 to 100 nts downstream of the transcription start site ( TSS ) , Pol II can be slowed down and paused by negative elongation factor ( NELF ) , DRB-sensitivity inducing factor ( DSIF ) and core promoter components ( Adelman and Lis , 2012; Kwak et al . , 2013 ) . The escape of Pol II from the paused state into productive elongation can be rate-limiting , and is dependent on the positive elongation factor P-TEFb , which consists of the Cdk9 kinase and CyclinT1 ( Marshall et al . , 1996; Lis et al . , 2000; Ni et al . , 2008 ) . P-TEFb is recruited directly or indirectly to the paused Pol II complex by transcription activators , where it phosphorylates the C-Terminal domain ( CTD ) , as well as DSIF and NELF , transforming DSIF into a positive elongation factor and evicting NELF ( Peterlin and Price , 2006 ) . P-TEFb appears to be both necessary and sufficient for paused Pol II escape into productive elongation; blocking P-TEFb kinase activity with the drug flavopiridol ( FP ) ( Chao and Price , 2001 ) in Drosophila causes an increase of promoter proximal Pol II at the majority of genes ( Henriques et al . , 2013 ) . The accumulation of paused Pol II has been proposed to be the result of rapid rounds of termination and re-initiation , creating a highly dynamic Pol II peak at the promoter proximal region ( Brannan et al . , 2012; Davidson et al . , 2012 ) . However , paused Pol II in Drosophila seems remarkably stable as shown by extensive kinetic and in vivo analysis at the Drosophila Hsp70 locus ( Buckley et al . , 2014 ) and by estimation of decay rates of over a dozen Drosophila genes by blocking TFIIH helicase activity , and thereby initiation , with the drug triptolide ( Trp ) ( Henriques et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , Drosophila Pol II transcription can be regulated by the promoter proximal , stable pausing and by transcription factor-controlled entry of paused Pol II into productive elongation in Drosophila . In mammals , promoter proximal pausing also seems to be a P-TEFb dependent and rate-limiting step during early elongation for many genes ( Core et al . , 2008; Rahl et al . , 2010 ) . Expressed genes without a peak of paused Pol II in one cell type , may acquire pausing in another ( Min et al . , 2011 ) , indicating that genes have the potential of becoming regulated by promoter proximal pausing even when a promoter proximal Pol II peak is absent . However , it is unclear if all genes undergo this P-TEFb dependent step in mammals , and how stable the paused Pol II is . Downstream of the promoter proximal region , the rate of Pol II elongation has been proposed to influence ( co- ) transcriptional processes such as splicing ( Howe et al . , 2003; de la Mata et al . , 2003; Shukla and Oberdoerffer , 2012 ) , 3\u2032 end processing ( Nag et al . , 2007 ) , termination ( Hazelbaker et al . , 2012 ) , and overall levels of mRNA ( Danko et al . , 2013 ) . Genic features that could potentially influence elongation rates are often , but not exclusively , associated with exons . Examples are histone modifications around exons and within the gene body ( Kolasinska-Zwierz et al . , 2009; Schor et al . , 2009; Schwartz et al . , 2009; Kim et al . , 2011; Saint-Andr\u00e9 et al . , 2011; Schor et al . , 2013 ) , nucleosome occupancy ( Schwartz et al . , 2009; Tilgner et al . , 2009 ) , GC content of both intronic and exonic DNA ( Schwartz et al . , 2009; Amit et al . , 2012 ) , and DNA methylation ( Maunakea et al . , 2013 ) . Many exonic chromatin features have been implicated in regulation of splicing as well ( Kolasinska-Zwierz et al . , 2009; Schor et al . , 2009; Shukla et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , Pol II has been shown to accumulate preferentially at spliced exons ( Brodsky et al . , 2005; Alexander et al . , 2010; Chodavarapu et al . , 2010; Kwak et al . , 2013 ) , leading to the hypothesis that reduction of Pol II elongation rate facilitates splice site recognition and spliceosome assembly , and thus , splicing of the associated intron ( Shukla and Oberdoerffer , 2012 ) . Indeed , transcription with a slow mutant of Pol II promotes alternative splicing in human and yeast cells ( Howe et al . , 2003; de la Mata et al . , 2003; de la Mata et al . , 2010 ) . The relationship of elongation rates , exons and other features of transcription units is still in dispute . Despite observations of Pol II accumulation at exons , three studies that directly measured elongation rates at multiple genes could not clearly demonstrate a correlation between exons and elongation rate ( Singh and Padgett , 2009; Brody et al . , 2011; Danko et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , although in vitro studies clearly show the effect of nucleosomes and histone modifications on elongation rate ( Orphanides et al . , 1998; Hodges et al . , 2009; Bintu et al . , 2012 ) , the in vivo consequences of chromatin on elongation rate are less understood , primarily because of the inability to measure elongation rates at many genes simultaneously . Previous studies have measured elongation rates ranging from 1 to 4 kb/min at individual genes in various organisms ( Ardehali and Lis , 2009 ) . Recently , elongation rates for over 160 genes were measured simultaneously by following the induction wave of Pol II after estradiol or TNF-alpha treatment ( Danko et al . , 2013 ) . Interestingly , this study showed a broad range of elongation rates between and within cell types , suggesting that the control of elongation rate may be used to regulate transcription and co-transcriptional processes . Thus far , elongation rates have only been measured in rapidly inducible genes , which limits the analytical power to reveal the associations to various features of transcription . Therefore , it is critical to expand the number of elongation rates measured simultaneously in vivo , to allow systematic analysis of the correlation between exons , chromatin and elongation rate . In this study , we use Trp and FP , two highly specific drugs to block initiation or pause escape , in combination with the sensitive GRO-seq assay ( Core et al . , 2008 ) to examine the drug-induced kinetic changes in Pol II distribution over promoter proximal regions and in the gene body . While FP blocks escape of paused Pol II , elongating Pol II can still clear the gene , and both changes can easily be followed by the sensitive and transcription orientation specific GRO-seq assay . We definitively show that P-TEFb is required for paused Pol II to escape into a productive elongation , providing a platform for transcription regulatory input on the early elongation rate , even for genes not previously known to be paused , confirming and extending earlier results using ChIP-seq of Pol II ( Rahl et al . , 2010 ) . Similarly , use of Trp to block Pol II initiation and entry to the pause , allows kinetic analysis of paused Pol II stability on nearly 3200 genes , showing that paused Pol II has a relatively long half-life and excluding rapid termination mechanisms as a major factor of Pol II regulation at the promoter . Furthermore , inhibition of Pol II gene body entry causes a \u2018wave\u2019 of elongating Pol II that , when assayed as a function of time after FP or Trp addition , allows measurement of elongation rates at over 1000 genes simultaneously , and over different regions within genes . We show that Pol II elongation rates increase within the gene body , suggesting a gradual maturation of the elongation complex as it progresses through the gene . In addition , we analyzed elongation rate variation as a function of a large number of genic and chromatin characteristics . Elongation rates correlate negatively with exon density and CpG content and methylation , and positively with active transcription mark H3K79me2 . Overall , we can explain \u223c30% of the gene-by-gene variation in elongation rates . Our study of the dynamics of Pol II shows that elongation rate is highly dynamic at all genes , both at the promoter proximal region and within the gene body . \n When a gene is activated , P-TEFb kinase is recruited to promoters and phosphorylates the paused Pol II\u00b7NELF\u00b7DISF complex , allowing paused Pol II to more rapidly escape into productive elongation . To identify all genes dependent on P-TEFb , we inhibited P-TEFb kinase activity with the drug FP . For comparison , we also inhibited pre-initiation complex formation with Trp . We isolated replicates of nuclei from untreated mESCs and cells treated for 2 , 5 , 12 . 5 , 25 and 50 min with 300 nM FP , as well as nuclei treated for 12 . 5 , 25 , and 50 min with 500 nM Trp ( Figure 1A ) and performed GRO-seq with these nuclei ( Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . To minimize off-target and secondary effects , we first determined the minimum concentrations of FP and Trp required to clear Pol II from the ActB gene body using ChIP-qPCR with an antibody to total Pol II ( not shown ) , and then used these concentrations , which were at the lower spectrum compared to previous studies ( Chao and Price , 2001; Rahl et al . , 2010; Titov et al . , 2011 ) , in our genome-wide analyses . Furthermore , we ensured that drug treated mESCs were morphologically indistinguishable from untreated cells . Biological replicates correlated extremely well ( Figure 1\u2014source data 2 and 3 ) and were combined for further analysis . Because inhibition of P-TEFb and initiation were anticipated to have large genome-wide effects on Pol II transcription , we normalized treated and control libraries to in vitro transcribed Arabidopsis thaliana RNAs added during the run-on . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02407 . 003Figure 1 .

( B ) As in ( A ) , but for FP time course . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02407 . 005 To assess the cellular effects of the drugs on Pol II and the phosphorylation of its CTD , we fractionated insoluble chromatin from the soluble cytoplasmic/nucleoplasmic fractions of control and drug treated mESCs and performed western blots with antibodies against the N-terminus of Rpb1 , and the Serine5 or Serine2 phosphorylated CTD ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Chromatin bound Pol II is reduced after treatment with either FP or Trp ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . However , phosphorylation of the CTD of chromatin bound Pol II was reduced only after FP treatment , but not Trp ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Overall , these results indicate that FP and Trp exert the intended effects on the phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD . Two long genes , Pkp4 and Ppp2r5e ( Figure 1B ) , and composite profiles of all genes ( Figure 1C , D ) illustrate the effects of P-TEFb inhibition by FP ( pause escape ) and TFIIH inhibition by Trp ( initiation ) on Pol II distribution . Both drugs work rapidly , as gene body density near the TSS approaches background levels within 12 . 5 min . The rapid drug action and immediate measurements thereafter minimize the possibility of major secondary effects within the short timeframe of the experiment ( Figure 1C , D ) . Furthermore , as the FP and Trp dependent block of Pol II entry into the gene persists , elongating Pol II forms \u2018inhibition waves\u2019 that are very similar between treatments ( Figure 1C , D , lower panels ) . Downstream of these inhibition waves , Pol II density levels remain equal throughout the time course , indicating that elongating Pol II in the gene body is not affected ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A , B ) . Conversely , the two drugs have opposite effects at the promoter proximal region . The composite paused Pol II peak increases after FP treatment ( Figure 1B , D ) , but disappears after Trp treatment ( Figure 1B , C ) . These results confirm that Trp blocks transcription initiation and causes the time dependent clearing of Pol II from the promoter and gene body , while FP\u2019s prominent effect is to block escape from the pause , causing a time dependent gene body clearance but enhanced promoter proximal Pol II pausing . Recently , Henriques et al . ( 2013 ) observed in Drosophila that the majority of genes are susceptible to P-TEFb inhibition . To extend this result to mammals , we quantified changes in Pol II distribution near the TSS after FP treatment and compared it to the effects of Trp treatment . We selected the top 75% actively transcribed genes that are over 3 . 5 kb in length and well resolved ( n = 6380 , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) , and generated heat-maps of the Pol II density \u00b1 2 kb around the TSSs of each gene before and after 50 min of drug treatment on the sense or antisense strand ( Figure 2 , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . The antisense strand shows the presence of upstream divergent transcription , a well-documented feature of mammalian promoters ( Core et al . , 2008; Seila et al . , 2009; Flynn et al . , 2011 ) . While Trp causes a reduction in the promoter and downstream regions of the annotated gene ( sense strand ) , and the upstream divergent region ( antisense strand ) ( Figure 2A , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ) , FP inhibition causes the opposite effect on the promoter regions ( Figure 2B , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Pol II density in the gene body is decreased after FP treatment , but Pol II increases in promoter proximal and divergent regions at the majority of genes ( Figure 2B , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B; Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . These results indicate that FP generally allows newly recruited Pol II to enter into early elongation and pausing , but blocks the entry into productive elongation . While a smaller fraction ( \u223c20% ) of genes displayed an unexpected decrease in paused and divergent Pol II peaks ( Figure 2\u2014source data 1; Figure 2B ) , these genes generally display lower levels of pausing and gene body transcription ( Figure 2B ) . This suggests that FP can reduce initiation or increase termination of weakly paused and less active genes , either directly or indirectly . Generally , the change in Pol II promoter density after FP inhibition correlates positively with the preexisting level of pausing and productive transcription of a gene ( Figure 2C ) , suggesting that efficient initiation is a prerequisite for an FP-induced increase in paused Pol II . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02407 . 009Figure 2 .

Change in promoter proximal and gene body read density , and pausing index after treatment with FP or Trp in time . The gene body change was measured in the region from 1 to 3 . 5 kb downstream of the TSS for each timepoint , and was called significantly increased when the read density ratio was greater then 1 with a Fisher Exact p-value <0 . 05 , or significantly decreased when the read density ratio was smaller then 1 with a Fisher Exact p-value <0 . 05 . The same for the pause peak increase and decrease , but using a 250 bp region with maximal read density in a window of \u00b1500 bp around the annotated TSS . The divergent peak was found by using a 250 bp region with maximal read density in a window of \u22121000 to +500 bp around the annotated TSS on the antisense strand , and change was defined similarly as the gene body change . Pausing indexes ( PI ) are the ratio between gene body and promoter proximal Pol II density , and the change in PI has therefore no Fisher Exact p-value associated with it . PI\u2019s are increased or decreased when the ratio between untreated and treated PI\u2019s is greater or smaller then 1 , respectively .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02407 . 010 Quantification of the decrease in read density directly downstream of the TSS shows that 96% of genes are significantly decreased after Trp treatment , while 95% of genes are decreased after FP treatment ( Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . This demonstrates that P-TEFb-dependent Pol II entry into productive elongation is as universal a step in gene transcription as TFIIH helicase-dependent initiation . After blocking Pol II initiation with Trp , the level of promoter proximal Pol II will decrease in time with a rate comprising both escape and termination . This decay rate indicates the stability of paused Pol II , from which we can infer whether pausing is regulated by continuous cycling of termination and re-initiation , characterized by a high decay rate and a minimal half-life of paused Pol II , or whether paused Pol II is relatively stable , and is released into productive elongation by a positive signal like recruitment and phosphorylation by P-TEFb . We calculated decay rates of Pol II after Trp treatment using a first order exponential decay model , and found high confidence decay rates for 3181 genes ( standard deviation <0 . 5 times the decay rate ) ( Figure 2D , E ) . The mean half-life of Pol II is 6 . 9 min , in agreement with the decay rates measured in Drosophila ( Henriques et al . , 2013; Buckley et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , promoter proximal Pol II stability is comparable between species and paused Pol II is relatively stable . Pol II that is already transcribing when FP is added generates a clearly distinguishable wave as time progresses . We tracked the rate of this wave\u2019s progress in an unbiased manner with a hidden Markov model ( HMM , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) at more than 1000 long and actively transcribed genes ( Figure 3A ) . The HMM was applied to each biological replicate , and only genes with reproducible results were used . We also tracked the wave following Trp addition as an independent strategy for blocking Pol II entry into genes ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B , C ) . The Trp inhibition wave was less clearly defined than the FP wave , likely due to the fact that Pol II initiated and paused before Trp treatment will gradually escape after TFIIH inhibition , resulting in a less defined block of Pol II entry into the gene body ( Figure 3A , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B , see Med13l ) . The middle of the inhibition wave identified by the HMM was defined as the transition point between the affected and unaffected region of the gene body . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02407 . 012Figure 3 .

( E ) Composite profile of total Pol II , Serine 2 and Serine 5 phosphorylated Pol II ChIP-seq in mid elongation rate genes shows that total and Serine 5 phosphorylated Pol II accumulate near the TSS , while Serine 2 phosphorylated Pol II gradually increases in the gene body . ( F ) Same as ( E ) , but normalized to total Pol II levels , showing that Serine 2 phosphorylation increase is independent from total Pol II levels . The most dramatic increase in Serine 2 phosphorylation is over the first 10 kb and is the interval corresponding to the largest increase in Pol II acceleration . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02407 . 016 On average , Pol II travels about 100 kb during 50 min of FP treatment . This corresponds to an elongation rate of about 2 kb/min , which is comparable to Pol II rates from previous studies ( Ardehali and Lis , 2009; Danko et al . , 2013 ) . The average Pol II inhibition wave travels at identical rates after either Trp or FP treatment , indicating that inhibition of P-TEFb or off-target effects of FP are unlikely to have significant effects on elongation rates downstream of the promoter proximal region ( Figure 3B ) . Although the HMM did not always derive transition points for each timepoint of drug treatment within genes , the average transition points of genes with detectable inhibition waves at three time-points behaved identically to the average of the genes where the HMM derived only one or two transition points ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . Similarly , for genes where both FP and Trp transition points were reliably measured , the average FP and Trp transition points aligned well ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . Both observations indicate that the measurements of transition points are unaffected by the groups of genes for which we measured the transition points after either treatment , or the method of inhibition . Next , we calculated elongation rates for genes that had two or more consecutive transition points . Since we do not include 0 min as a baseline , and start measuring transition points after 5 min when significant changes in Pol II distribution are observed , the lag time of the inhibitor action does not affect the elongation rate estimations . We directly measured 141 early ( 5\u201312 . 5 min ) , 938 mid ( 12 . 5\u201325 min ) , and 245 late ( 25-50 min ) elongation rates , with average elongation rates of 0 . 5 , 1 . 8 and 2 . 4 kb/min respectively ( Figure 3\u2014source data 1 ) . The variation within each group of elongation rates was considerable , with standard deviations of 0 . 43 kb/min , 0 . 69 kb/min and 0 . 79 kb/min for the early , mid and late rates , respectively . Thus , the direct measurement of elongation rates after inhibition of Pol II gene entry by FP or Trp leads to two main observations . First , elongation rates vary considerably between genes , and second , the elongation complex seems to accelerate as it transcribes through the gene . We proceeded to confirm both observations independently . To verify our directly measured elongation rates , we compared the mid elongation rates group ( n = 938 ) , to an independent measurement of relative elongation rates ( Ameur et al . , 2011 ) , using intronic reads of ribosomal RNA depleted total RNA-seq data from Sigova et al . ( 2013 ) in mESCs . This method is based on the observation that the majority of intronic RNA is spliced and degraded co-transcriptionally ( Djebali et al . , 2012; Tilgner et al . , 2012 ) , producing a saw-tooth pattern corresponding to RNA-seq reads in introns across genes ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A; Ameur et al . , 2011 ) . The gradient of RNA density from the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 splice sites ( SS ) of the intron , normalized for gene expression by dividing intronic reads with the average read counts near the 3\u2032 end of the introns , reflects the time Pol II spends during elongation along the intron . Slow Pol II will take longer to transcribe an intron , accumulating more RNA-seq reads prior to splicing and degradation , and resulting in a steep intronic RNA-seq read gradient . Fast Pol II will spend less time in an intron , reaching the 3\u2032 SS and subsequent splicing and degradation of intronic RNA faster , resulting in a flatter intronic read pattern and a lower slope ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . Because the saw tooth pattern was more clearly distinguishable in larger introns and because intronic reads are much less abundant than exonic reads in typical RNA-seq datasets , we grouped introns and used pooled intronic read counts on all introns longer than 10 kb . Similar to what was shown in an individual gene example ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A ) , we found a negative slope of the read densities as a function of the distance from the 3\u2032 SS ( Figure 3D ) . GRO-seq density after 25 min FP treatment in the mid elongation rate genes ordered from slow to fast shows clear alignment of the Pol II inhibition wave ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C , left ) . To verify the observed gene-to-gene variation in elongation rates of these genes , we split the 938 mid elongation rates genes into quartiles . The slope of the intronic density plots of the quartiles decreases as the directly measured elongation rates become faster ( Figure 3E , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C , right ) , independently confirming the gene-to-gene variation in elongation rates . Next , we explored the acceleration of Pol II within the gene body in independent ways: ( 1 ) Directly measuring elongation rates in different regions within genes , ( 2 ) Analyzing relative elongation rates within different regions of the gene body with intronic RNA-seq read gradients . First , our direct measurement of early , mid and late elongation rates after either FP or Trp treatment suggests that Pol II accelerates as it transcribes through the gene body ( Figure 3C , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C ) , which is also evident from the non-linear increase of all the HMM-derived transition points plotted against time ( Figure 3B , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D , E ) . Moreover , elongation rates derived from multiple regions within the same gene were significantly greater further downstream in the gene body ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A ) , showing that this acceleration occurs within most genes and is not a consequence of elongation rate variation between genes . Also , Danko et al . ( 2013 ) recently showed a similar acceleration of elongation rates within the gene body for estrogen or TNF-alpha induced genes . Second , we examined the read density in introns , as described above , in the region from the TSS to 25 kb , and in introns 50 kb downstream of the TSS within the same genes . The slope of intron read density as a function of distance to the 3\u2032 SS is higher in the upstream region compared to the downstream region ( Figure 3F ) , indicative of slower elongation rates upstream in genes , and acceleration as Pol II travels within the gene body . The acceleration is not constant , but decreases as transcription proceeds ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B , C ) , suggesting that the Pol II elongation complex \u2018matures\u2019 and reaches its maximum speed while transcribing a gene . The maturation could be caused by the stochastic accumulation of elongation factors to the Pol II complex , or by gradual stochastic loss of pausing factors . Indeed , pausing negatively correlates with mid elongation rates , while late elongation rates are not affected ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3D ) , suggesting that pausing delays the maturation of Pol II . Furthermore , ChIP-seq composite profiles of total Pol II and of Ser5 or Ser2 phosphorylated CTD ( Rahl et al . , 2010 ) show that Pol II Ser2 phosphorylation , which is a product of P-TEFb activity and other kinases ( Bartkowiak et al . , 2010; Devaiah et al . , 2012 ) and presumably coincides with the loss of NELF and DSIF pausing activity , increases gradually within the gene body within the same region as the acceleration of the elongation complex ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3E , F ) . This suggests that Pol II is modified gradually while it transcribes , leading to maturation and increased elongation rates . The GRO-seq density on the gene body shows the amount of productively elongating Pol II and reflects the transcriptional activity of genes . However , the average GRO-seq density shows a decrease as the Pol II travels into the body of the gene ( Figure 1C , D , top panels ) . The decreasing pattern of gene body Pol II density in itself could be explained by the gradual termination of Pol II ( Figure 4A , top; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ) , but alternatively , an accelerating Pol II could on its own produce a decreasing gene body Pol II density ( Figure 4A , bottom; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . Thirdly , a mixed model can be envisioned where a decrease in termination and acceleration go hand in hand as Pol II progresses in the gene body ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C; Mason and Struhl , 2005 ) . The directly measured elongation rates ( Figure 3C ) can be used to assess the degree to which termination and acceleration models contribute to the observed Pol II density decrease . If there is no loss of Pol II through termination , then Pol II density should be inversely proportional to the elongation rate . Therefore , comparing the inverse of the measured elongation rates ( v\u22121 ) with the Pol II density ( D ) can be used to determine which model of Pol II elongation is more probable ( Figure 4A ) . On average , the inverse of the elongation rate ( v\u22121 ) does not fall below the density plot ( D ) in the gene body region ( Figure 4B ) where the rates are measured ( starting from the average 5 min transition point 2 . 3 kb downstream of TSS ) . This indicates that the bulk of the change in Pol II density stems from the acceleration of stably elongating Pol II molecules . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02407 . 017Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02407 . 018 We further assessed the contribution of termination and acceleration by simulating these three models of Pol II dynamics and density profiles with different levels of termination . The measured elongation rates fit better to the model when the termination was insignificant compared to the acceleration ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Therefore , Pol II termination does not appear to have a global contribution to the amount of Pol II in the regions more downstream of 2\u20133 kb from the TSS . Elongation rates can influence the total mRNA output . The steady state mRNA level is determined by the balance of nascent RNA production rate , which is represented by GRO-seq density times the elongation rate , as well as RNA processing and mRNA degradation ( Figure 4C ) . Thus , deviation from a log\u2013log slope of 1 in a correlation plot between steady state mRNA levels as measured by RNA-seq and GRO-seq density ( Figure 4D ) could potentially be explained by differences in elongation rates . Interestingly , genes that are relatively highly expressed show a slope of 1 . 8 indicating that mRNA level is not a simple function of GRO-seq density for these genes ( Figure 4E ) . We observed a modest correlation between elongation rate and GRO-seq ( Figure 4F ) , indicating that highly active genes have faster elongation rates and produce more mRNA , in agreement with a previous analysis of a smaller set of inducible genes ( Danko et al . , 2013 ) . To further assess the influence of elongation rates on steady state mRNA level , we examined the correlation between mRNA-seq and GRO-seq in the large group of mid elongation rate genes ( n = 938 ) . These highly expressed genes display a log\u2013log slope of 2 . 2 ( Figure 4G ) . In contrast , when plotting the production rates , that is the mid elongation rates multiplied by the corresponding GRO-seq densities , vs mRNA level , the slope is reduced to 1 . 6 ( Figure 4H ) , indicating that elongation rate can partially explain the divergence between Pol II density and the mRNA level at highly transcribed genes . The remaining positive correlation might be explained either by increased mRNA stability or RNA processing efficiency in highly transcribed genes . The large number of measured elongation rates allows us to identify major factors that influence variation in elongation rates . We used genes for which we measured the large number of mid elongation rates ( 12 . 5\u201325 min , n = 938 ) to increase statistical power , and to rule out major effects of intrinsic acceleration in the comparison between elongation rates . Existing genome-wide data of transcription factors , chromatin modifiers , and chromatin modifications were used to detect determinants of elongation rate ( see for full list of features Figure 5\u2014source data 1 ) . \n Inhibition of P-TEFb , like inhibition of initiation , affects >95% of actively transcribed genes , showing that escape from pause is an integral step in the transcription cycle . However , not all active genes show signs of promoter proximal accumulation of paused Pol II in mES cells ( Min et al . , 2011 , this study ) . Clearly , this accumulation of Pol II depends on both the rate with which pause complex is formed ( the transcription initiation rate ) and its rate of escape to elongation . Some transcription factors stimulate the formation of paused Pol II , others recruit P-TEFb directly or indirectly to facilitate the escape of paused Pol II , while others do both ( Blau et al . , 1996; Rahl et al . , 2010; Danko et al . , 2013; Li and Gilmour , 2013 ) . The balance of these factors at promoters , together with pausing factors that stabilize Pol II ( Yamaguchi et al . , 1999; Lee et al . , 2008; Kwak et al . , 2013 ) determine the relative accumulation paused Pol II . As we ( Figure 2 ) and others ( Henriques et al . , 2013; Buckley et al . , 2014 ) have shown , pausing of Pol II is remarkably stable at many genes , indicating that termination does not have a great effect on promoter proximal Pol II levels . This stably-paused Pol II may help maintain accessibility of the promoter to regulatory factors that tune transcriptional output by simply changing the escape rate of paused Pol II into the body of the gene . Indeed , heat shock has recently been shown both optically and biochemically to increase the escape of paused Pol II into the gene body at the Drosophila Hsp70 locus without decreasing termination of paused Pol II , arguing against a role for termination in the regulation of the accumulation and escape of paused Pol II . If Pol II undergoes a pausing step in the transcription cycle at all genes , then blocking P-TEFb kinase activity should lead to an increase of paused Pol II . Indeed , this is what we observe for the majority of genes ( Figure 2 ) . However , a small fraction of poorly expressed and weakly paused genes show a reduction in paused Pol II after FP treatment . We speculate that transcription initiation , Pol II pausing , and escape into productive elongation are not necessarily uncoupled processes for all genes . Instead , disruption of pausing dynamics by FP may feed back on transcription initiation and decrease the formation of paused Pol II . Other observations support a cross-talk of pausing and initiation . Depletion of Nelf can decrease expression of a subset of genes , indicative of a dependency of initiation on pausing , in this case through the maintenance of nucleosome free promoters by paused Pol II ( Gilchrist et al . , 2008 ) . Furthermore , precise mapping of Pol II reveals that core promoter elements appear to contribute to stronger and more promoter proximal pausing in Drosophila ( Kwak et al . , 2013; Venters and Pugh , 2013 ) . Overall , the specific inhibitors used in this manuscript inhibit either initiation or pause escape seemingly with few secondary effects , as the Pol II inhibition profile within gene bodies is remarkably similar after either drug treatment . Nonetheless , perturbations of one process could possibly have effects on the other , at least for some genes . Because P-TEFb inhibition affects all active genes , we could determine over 1300 individual elongation rates of Pol II , often at multiple regions within the same gene . Danko et al . ( 2013 ) has used GRO-seq following rapid induction of transcription to examine the rate of the Pol II induction wave front . Our elongation rates derived after inhibition of P-TEFb were slightly lower in comparison to the elongation rates derived after induction which may point to a model in which lagging Pol II pushes leading Pol II thereby increasing overall elongation rates ( Saeki and Svejstrup , 2009 ) . Indeed , elongation rates in highly expressed genes , where elongating Pol II is more tightly packed , are faster compared to rates in poorly expressed genes in both studies ( Figure 4; Danko et al . , 2013 ) . Moreover , we have shown that chromatin composition , specifically H3K79me2 and CpG content , of genes influences elongation rates . Interestingly , mouse ESCs have high levels of DNA methylation ( Stadler et al . , 2011 ) . DNA methylation and CG content negatively influence elongation rate , and could partially explain the difference between mESC and differentiated cell line derived elongation rates ( Danko et al . , 2013 ) . Finally , repression of H3K79me2 has recently been observed to increase reprogramming efficiency of fibroblasts to iPSCs , by reducing expression of lineage specific genes in the first stages of reprogramming ( Onder et al . , 2012 ) . We have shown that elongation rates can influence steady state mRNA levels ( Figure 4 ) , and that H3K79me2 positively influences elongation rate ( Figure 6 ) . We therefore argue that reprogramming efficiency by reducing H3K79me2 levels could be a result of elongation rate modulation . Finally , we emphasize that the variation of elongation rates revealed in this study have enormous potential in timing of mRNA production . Mammalian genes of over 200 kb and twofold differences in elongation rates between genes are not uncommon , leading to variation in response time of mRNA production of an hour or more . This timing can be very relevant in development and the stress response ( Thummel , 1992; Swinburne and Silver , 2008 ) , and could not only be dependent on intron length , but also be regulated by elongation rate modulation . The hypothesis that Pol II elongation rate regulates splicing is longstanding ( reviewed in Shukla and Oberdoerffer 2012 ) . Here , we show directly that exon density is the greatest predictor of elongation rates ( Figure 6 ) , strongly suggesting that Pol II slows down at each exon . Exonic features such as CpG methylation , H3K36me3 and H3K4me1 could work synergistically to establish a transient slow down at exons ( Figure 6 ) . Although we demonstrate that Pol II slows down at exons , presumably to facilitate splicing , we could not determine whether a slowly transcribing Pol II increases inclusion of exons . Although rates of elongation have been shown to influence splicing outcomes ( Howe et al . , 2003; de la Mata et al . , 2003 ) , the effects on specific genes , we suggest , will be governed by competing processes such as rates of splicing complex assembly , RNA secondary and tertiary structure formation , and regulatory factor binding . While our data cannot on its own assess the outcomes on alternative splicing of such competing and cooperating processes , our observed slow down of transcription at exons supports the general view that Pol II elongation rates are coupled to splicing at all exons . \n Cell culturing of the V6 . 5 mES cell line was done as in Monkhorst et al . ( 2008 ) , and drug treatment was performed on pre-plated mES cells to remove irradiated MEF-feeder cells , grown for one passage on 15 cm2 plates up to \u223c70% confluence before isolation of nuclei . Drugs treatment was done by replacing ES medium with pre-heated ES medium containing 300 nM FP , 500 nM Trp or 0 . 0125% DMSO as no Trp control . Nuclei isolation was done according to Min et al . ( 2011 ) . Nuclear run-on and nascent RNA library preparation was performed as in Core et al . ( 2008 ) . In brief , after rinsing the 15 cm2 plates with drug-treated cells with ice-cold PBS , pH 7 . 4 , cells were scraped off in 15 ml cell lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris-Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM Sucrose , 3 mM CaCl2 , 2 mM MgAc2 , 0 . 5% NP-40 , 5 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , protease inhibitors ) , and spun down at 4\u00b0C . Cells were dounced 50x in 5 ml fresh cell lysis buffer on ice and spun down , after which supernatant was discarded and nuclei were taken up in \u223c250 \u03bcl of glycerol storage buffer ( 50 mM Tris-Cl , pH 8 . 3 , 40% glycerol , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 5 mM MgAc2 , 5 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , protease inhibitors ) and snap frozen . For each nuclear run-on ( NRO ) , 107 nuclei were mixed with an equal volume of reaction buffer ( 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8 . 0 , 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT , 300 mM KCL , 20 units of SUPERaseIn , 1% sarkosyl , 500uM ATP , GTP , and Br-UTP , 2 \u00b5M CTP and 0 . 33 \u00b5M \u03b1-32P-CTP [3000 Ci/mmole] ) . The NRO was performed at 30\u00b0C for 5 min , and a population of \u223c100 different in vitro transcribed Arabidopsis thaliana spike-in RNAs with and without Br-UTP was added to the nascent RNA . The RNA was fragmented to \u223c150 nts with 0 . 2N NaOH and BrU-RNA was isolated three consecutive times with BrdU-antibody beads ( sc-32323; Santa Cruz Technologies , Dallas , TX ) , with enzymatic TAP and PNK treatments to remove the cap and 3\u2032-phosphate and to add a 5\u2032-phosphate , as well as Illumina adaptor ligations between the BrU-RNA isolation steps . The three consecutive isolation steps lead to an approximate 500 . 000x enrichment of BrU-RNA over background RNA . BrU-RNA was reverse transcribed , amplified , barcoded and Illumina sequenced . Each dataset was done in replicate . All the GRO-seq libraries were sequenced in 50 nt runs on the Illumina HiSeq and split by barcode . Reads were trimmed to 32-mers and Illumina adaptors were removed with the cutadapt tool ( https://code . google . com/p/cutadapt/ ) and aligned uniquely with two mismatches with bowtie to the mm9 reference genome . Replicates were highly correlated and were pooled for further analysis ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , with exception of the extensively degraded 25 min Trp-treated #1 replicate . Normalization between datasets was done with uniquely aligned spike-in RNA reads . Sequence datasets can be found under GEO admission number GSE48895 . The mm9 RefSeq genelist was used as reference genelist for all analysis . Unmappable regions of the genome were identified and excluded by aligning the genome to itself in 30-mers and reads aligned to these regions were not used in analysis . To establish which genes were active above background with a Fisher exact p-value of <0 . 05 , we mapped reads from control datasets to gene-poor regions , took 10 \u00d7 the average read density of these two datasets as a safe threshold for background ( 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 reads/bp ) . The genes for analysis of FP and Trp sensitivity are the top 75% active genes larger than 3 . 5 kb present in both the FP as the Trp control dataset , without genes that have an annotated TSS within 1000 bp on the opposite strand ( bidirectional genes ) and genes that have an annotated polyA site upstream of its TSS within 10 kb ( tandem genes ) ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A , n = 6380 ) . Pause and divergent peak locations were found by searching for maximum sense or antisense strand read density in 10 bp windows from \u00b1500 bp or \u22121000 to +500 around the annotated TSS of the 6380 selected genes , respectively . The peak was defined as a 250 bp region centered on the maximum 10 bp window . The pausing index is the ratio of the pause peak density and the annotated gene body region density ( +1 kb from the TSS to polyA site ) . To calculate the fold change after FP or Trp treatment for each timepoint , we added a pseudo-count to the divergent , pause or gene body region close to the TSS ( +1 kb to +3 . 5 kb only ) , calculated the density in the mappable region of each and took the ratio of the read densities . The change was significant if the Fisher Exact p-value was <0 . 05 . Decay rates were calculated by selecting seven points randomly of the seven Trp datasets for 1000 times and doing non-linear regression using an exponential decay equation ( Rt = RWT \u00d7 e\u2212 ( \u03bbt ) , with pause peak read density R , decay rate \u03bb , and Trp treatment time t ) with each of the seven points . The mean of the regressions is the decay rate and the standard deviation of the decay rate is the standard deviation of the 1000 individual regressions . Composite profiles of all genes >12 . 5 kb or >150 kb were made in R with read density taken in 50 bp windows . Density plots of the 6380 selected genes around the TSS were made by taking the log10 of counted reads plus a pseudo-count in 10 bp windows around the annotated TSS for the sense and antisense strands in the control and 50 min treated datasets . The change in each 10 bp window was calculated by subtracting the no FP/Trp from the 50 min FP/Trp log10 read count . Genes were ordered by maximum pause peak read density decrease or increase after 50 min Trp or FP treatment . The density in windows was plotting using the R packages gplots and RColorBrewer . First , we selected genes longer than a sufficient cut-off for each time-point ( 30 kb for 5 min and 12 . 5 min , 60 kb for 25 min , and 150 kb for 50 min ) , that have corresponding transcription units at the annotated TSS , but do not contain intragenic transcription units defined by the genome-wide transcription unit calling algorithm ( described below in this section ) . Also , genes that have premature termination before the annotated 3\u2032 ends and/or the 60 kb/150 kb mark are removed using a regional transcription unit calling algorithm ( described below in this section ) . After filtering , the number of selected genes are n = 4461 , 2769 and 571 for genes longer than 30 kb , 60 kb , and 150 kb , respectively . The transition points from the drug affected ( inhibited ) region to the drug unaffected ( uninhibited ) region of the gene body were determined by a regional transition point calling algorithm ( described below in this section ) for each replicate of FP or Trp GRO-seq time courses . The following is the description of the custom made HMM algorithms in c++ . We analyzed relative elongation rates with methods described in Ameur et al . ( 2011 ) , using intronic reads of total poly-A ( \u2212 ) RNA-seq ( Sigova et al . 2013 ) . Intronic reads are sparse , so we pooled multiple genes to assess the relative elongation rate . First , introns longer than 10 kb are selected . Introns containing annotated alternative exons were split in a 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 intron to exclude the interference from exonic RNA-seq reads . Second , selected introns are subgrouped by length in 10 kb bins; that is 10\u201320 kb , 20\u201330 kb , 30\u201340 kb groups , etc . We used up to 50 kb for the estimation of elongation rates ( up to 80 kb are plotted ) . Third , introns are aligned at the 3\u2032 splicing sites ( 3\u2032SS ) , and intronic reads are counted in 100 bp windows in each intron length subgroup . To normalize for differences in the transcription level in each group , the read counts in windows are normalized to the read density 1 kb upstream of the 3\u2032 SS to the 3\u2019SS in each group ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . Finally , we plotted read counts per window for each intronic position in all the subgroups ( Figure 3D ) . The slope of the RNA-seq gradient was obtained using the linear regression in the R statistics package . Apart from the termination and acceleration models described in Figure 4A , we also considered a mixed model , in which elongating Pol II could consist of different populations; fast Pol II , transcribing at maximum speed throughout the entire gene body , and slow , non-processive Pol II . If the slow population terminates prematurely leaving the fast Pol IIs , then the overall apparent elongation rate would increase as transcription proceeds in the gene body . To differentiate between the termination , acceleration and mixed model , we used a Monte Carlo simulation describing the dynamics of Pol II movement through the gene body . In short , we simulated the time course of the inhibition wave of Pol II ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) and used the regional transition point calling algorithm ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) to define the transition points of inhibition waves and elongation rates . The relationship between the simulated Pol II density and the inverse of average elongation rates of 1000 simulated experiments shows a clear difference between the models ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B , C , D ) . When we plotted the slope of simulated elongation rates vs the slope of inverse density in various simulated acceleration and termination models along with actual observations , the observations appear to fit better with the distribution of the acceleration models than the termination models ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . In detail , the dynamics of elongating Pol II in gene body is simulated using a newly designed modeling program to describe Pol II transcription through a gene . First , we modeled a Pol II transcription complex entering the gene body region with an entry rate ( r ) as a function of time . For the steady state assumption , r is a constant over time ( t ) , while for the simulation of the inhibition wave r is an exponential decay function of t . Each Pol II molecule was generated with the rate r , and has a randomly assigned activity parameter ( A ) , from 0 to 100 as a percentile . This activity parameter A is an intrinsic value that determines the relative elongation and the termination rates for each Pol II molecule . The termination constant ( kt ) and the elongation rate ( v ) are the functions dependent on the activity ( A ) as well as the position ( x ) within the gene body of the Pol II molecule . For instance , in a simple acceleration model where all Pol II molecules accelerate uniformly , kt = 0 for all A and x , while v is an increasing function of x but a constant function for A . In a termination model , intrinsically active Pol II molecules elongate faster while less active ones elongate at a slower rate and terminate more frequently . In this case , kt is a decreasing function of A , and v is an increasing function of A regardless of x . When running a simulation , the entry , termination , and progression events are assessed after each time increment of \u0394t . For each event , a pseudorandom number between 0 and 1 is generated and compared to the probability of initiation as described by 1-exp ( -r\u0394t ) , termination as described by 1-exp ( -kt\u0394t ) , and processive elongation as described by 1-exp ( -v\u0394t ) respectively . If the number is less than the probability of any of the processes , the status of the polymerase changes accordingly . For the approximation of the progression event , the polymerase can move k bases following the Poisson distribution if the pseudorandom number is in the range ( F ( k; \u03bb ) , F ( k+1; \u03bb ) ) , where F is the cumulative Poisson distribution function and \u03bb = v\u0394t . If there is a collision event between two polymerases , the leading polymerase terminates . The distribution of simulated Pol II in N = 1000 DNA templates are equilibrated for 10 , 000s . The average Pol II distribution at this point is recorded as D . Upon the simulation of the decay of entry , average Pol II distribution is recorded every 100 s over 100 , 000 bp region . The average distribution at each time point is analyzed using the HMM , and the transition points are estimated . From the time course of transition points , the apparent elongation rates ( va ) are calculated as a function of the position ( x ) . The slope plot ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E ) is generated by calculating \u0394D\u22121/\u0394x and \u0394va/\u0394x using linear interpolation between x = 5 , 15 , 25 , 35 , 45 , 55 kb or t = 5 , 12 . 5 , 25 , and 50 min . We tested the following parameter spaces for the simulation . Only one examples of the results for each simple termination , mixed , and stable acceleration models are shown in Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D . However , all the described models were used to generate the scatterplot in Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E . We calculated the intrinsic acceleration constant a of Pol II with vend = vstart \u00d7 a \u0394t for corrected elongation rates between 5 to 12 . 5 min and 12 . 5 to 25 min FP treatment , and for 12 . 5 to 25 min and 25 to 50 min FP treatment . Elongation rates were corrected for exon density within the transition region where the rate was measured by using the linear regression formulas in Figure 5B and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A , B . For the linear regressions the elongation rates over transition regions that had an exon density >0 were taken into account to assess the additive time delay per exon . ChIPseq datasets listed in Figure 5\u2014source data 1 were downloaded and aligned to the mm9 genome when necessary . Read density was derived in the mappable promoter region or the average 12 . 5\u201325 min or 25\u201450 min transition regions . We correlated read density of ChIPseq factors in the promoter or transition regions with elongation rates . For factors that correlated with elongation rates , we made additional density profiles from \u22122 to 30 kb from the TSS in 25 bp windows in the 12 . 5\u201325 min mid elongation rate genes , ordered by mid elongation rate from slow to fast . Also , we looked at the elongation rates in quartiles of correlating factors in the promoter or transition regions . To apply the linear modeling methods , we converted individual genomic features to fit the Gaussian distributions using rank ordered z-statistics ( R statistics package ) . Briefly , the percentile rank of a gene\u2019s specific genomic feature is converted to a z-score through the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function . This conversion enables the comparison of different non-linear features , yet also allows us to use the linear modeling tools such as least square methods and principal component analysis . Genes with tied rank orders are randomly assigned to have different ranks . The major features taken into account have a p-value<0 . 01 from the simple linear regression ( function lm ( ) in R ) . The z-score distribution between the elongation rate and a major feature is plotted in a [\u22124 , 4] \u00d7 [\u22124 , 4] range ( Figure 6A ) . The principal component analysis ( function princomp ( ) in R ) between the two features was used to identify the eigenvector that shows the direction of correlation , and a red arrow was depicted to represent the direction as well as the magnitude of the correlation coefficient . For the iterative linear modeling , we took the residual elongation rates after fitting to the linear modeling using a 1\u00b0 feature ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A , first row ) , and the residuals are again converted using the rank order z-statistics . The converted residuals are fitted to a 2\u00b0 feature linear modeling ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A , second row ) . The correlation coefficient of the iterative linear modeling was compared to the correlation coefficient of a single linear modeling using the 2\u00b0 feature alone , and the percent reduction of the R2 by the 1\u00b0 feature was color scaled in a combinatorial manner to produce the heatmap in Figure 6B . The predicted values from the linear models using one or multiple features are plotted against the actual z-scores of the measured elongation rates to show the convergence of the prediction to the observation ( Figure 6C ) . Chromatin bound and nucleoplasmic/cytoplasmic free proteins were extracted after treatment of pre-plated mES cells for 50 min with 300 nM FP , 500 nM Trp or 0 . 0125% DMSO as no Trp control . Cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS , pH 7 . 4 , scraped off the plates , spun and resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7 . 5 , 3 mM EDTA , 10% glycerol , 150 mM KAc , 1 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 1% NP-40 , and phosphatase and protease inhibitors ) , dounced 60 times on ice and centrifuged at 13 , 000 rpm for 5 min at 4\u00b0C . Supernatant was snap frozen as the unbound fraction , while the remaining pellet was resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer and sonicated to break up the chromatin and solubilize the pellet , and snap frozen . Western blot analysis was done in triplicate with antibodies against the Ser5 ( 3E8; EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA ) or Ser2 ( 3E10; EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA ) phosphorylated CTD , or N-terminal Pol II ( N-20; Santa Cruz Technologies , Dallas , TX ) ."}

All detect light using specialized cells called photoreceptors , of which there are two main kinds: ciliary and rhabdomeric . Crustaceans and their relatives , including insects , have rhabdomeric photoreceptors; while animals with backbones , including humans , have ciliary photoreceptors . There are also several groups of animals , mostly sea-dwellers , that inherited both types of photoreceptors from their ancestors that lived millions of years ago . These include the marine ragworm , Platynereis dumerilii . The larvae of Platynereis are free-swimming plankton . Each has a transparent brain and six small , pigmented eyes . The eyes contain rhabdomeric photoreceptors . These enable the larvae to detect and swim towards light sources . Yet the larval brain also contains ciliary photoreceptors , the role of which was unknown . Veraszt\u00f3 , G\u00fchmann et al . now show that ultraviolet light activates ciliary photoreceptors , whereas cyan , or blue-green , light inhibits them . Shining ultraviolet light onto Platynereis larvae makes the larvae swim downwards . By contrast , cyan light makes the larvae swim upwards . In the ocean , ultraviolet light is most intense near the surface , while cyan light reaches greater depths . Ciliary photoreceptors thus help Platynereis to avoid harmful ultraviolet radiation near the surface . Though if the larvae swim too deep , cyan light inhibits the ciliary photoreceptors and activates the rhabdomeric pigmented eyes . This makes the larvae swim upwards again . Using high-powered microscopy , Veraszt\u00f3 , G\u00fchmann et al . confirm that neural circuits containing ciliary photoreceptors exchange messages with circuits containing rhabdomeric photoreceptors . This suggests that the two work together to form a depth gauge . By enabling the larvae to swim at a preferred depth , the depth gauge influences where the worms end up as adults . Its discovery should also stimulate new ideas about the evolution of eyes and photoreceptors .", "source": "Ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells represent two main lines of photoreceptor-cell evolution in animals . The two cell types coexist in some animals , however how these cells functionally integrate is unknown . We used connectomics to map synaptic paths between ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptors in the planktonic larva of the annelid Platynereis and found that ciliary photoreceptors are presynaptic to the rhabdomeric circuit . The behaviors mediated by the ciliary and rhabdomeric cells also interact hierarchically . The ciliary photoreceptors are UV-sensitive and mediate downward swimming in non-directional UV light , a behavior absent in ciliary-opsin knockout larvae . UV avoidance overrides positive phototaxis mediated by the rhabdomeric eyes such that vertical swimming direction is determined by the ratio of blue/UV light . Since this ratio increases with depth , Platynereis larvae may use it as a depth gauge during vertical migration . Our results revealed a functional integration of ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells in a zooplankton larva . \n Bilaterian animals have two major photoreceptor cell-types , the rhabdomeric- and the ciliary-type photoreceptor cells ( rPRC and cPRC , respectively ) ( Arendt , 2003; Arendt et al . , 2004; Eakin , 1979; Erclik et al . , 2009 ) . These cells have distinct morphologies and express different classes of opsins ( light-sensitive proteins ) . Rhabdomeric PRCs have apical microvillar specializations ( rhabdom ) that store the opsin photopigments . The visual photoreceptor cells in most protostome eyes , including the compound eyes of arthropods , the pigment-cup eyes of annelids and the camera or stalk eyes of mollusks , are rhabdomeric and express rhadomeric ( r- ) opsins ( Arendt et al . , 2002; Cowman et al . , 1986; Katagiri et al . , 2001; Katagiri et al . , 1995; Ovchinnikov et al . , 1988; Pollock and Benzer , 1988; Randel et al . , 2013 ) . Rhabdomeric PRCs also exist in the pigmented eyespots of both protostomes ( e . g . annelids , flatworms ) and some non-vertebrate deuterostomes ( hemichordates , cephalochordates ) ( Arendt and Wittbrodt , 2001; Braun et al . , 2015; Nakao , 1964 ) . In contrast , the visual eyes of vertebrates have cPRCs ( rods and cones ) where the ciliary ( c- ) opsin photopigment is stored in specialized ciliary membrane compartments ( Jan and Revel , 1974; Nir et al . , 1984 ) . Ciliary PRCs also occur in some invertebrates , where they can be part of pigmented eyespots ( e . g . some mollusks and flatworms ) , in simple eyes ( e . g . some nemerteans ) , or as brain photoreceptors not associated with pigment cells ( e . g . some annelids ) ( Arendt et al . , 2004; Barber et al . , 1967; D\u00f6hren and Bartolomaeus , 2018; Randel and J\u00e9kely , 2016 ) . The class of opsin expressed in a PRC generally correlates with the cell\u2019s morphological type , with cPRCs usually expressing c-opsins and rPRCs expressing r-opsins ( Arendt , 2003; Arendt et al . , 2004; Randel et al . , 2013; Vopalensky et al . , 2012 ) . However some exceptions to this rule are known , such as the occasional coexpression of melanopsin ( an r-opsin ) with c-opsins or r-opsins with Go- or xenopsins ( Davies et al . , 2011; G\u00fchmann et al . , 2015; V\u00f6cking et al . , 2017 ) . Given their broad phylogenetic distribution and shared opsin expression , both photoreceptor cell types likely coexisted in the last common ancestor of bilaterians . The two cell types still coexist in several marine animals , including cephalochordates , some mollusks , flatworms , and annelids ( Arendt et al . , 2004; McReynolds and Gorman , 1970; Randel and J\u00e9kely , 2016; Vopalensky et al . , 2012 ) and form parts of pigmented or non-pigmented light-sensitive structures . Understanding how the two photoreceptor cell types integrate at the functional and circuit levels in these animals will help to clarify the history of eyes and photoreceptor cells . Here we study the planktonic larva of Platynereis dumerilii , a marine annelid that has both photoreceptor cell types . In Platynereis , non-pigmented brain cPRCs with ramified cilia express a ciliary type opsin ( c-opsin1 ) ( Arendt et al . , 2004 ) and coexist with r-opsin-expressing rPRCs that are part of the pigmented visual eyes ( adult eyes ) and eyespots ( Arendt et al . , 2002; J\u00e9kely et al . , 2008; Randel et al . , 2014 , 2013 ) . The pigmented larval eyespots and the adult eyes mediate early- and late-stage larval phototaxis , respectively ( G\u00fchmann et al . , 2015; J\u00e9kely et al . , 2008; Randel et al . , 2014 ) . The mechanism and neuronal circuitry of both early- and late-stage larval phototaxis is well understood . Trochophore larvae ( approximately 1\u20132 . 5 days post fertilization ) have a pair of pigmented eyespots with a rPRC that directly innervates the adjacent ciliary band . This rPRC is cholinergic and expresses r-opsin3 ( J\u00e9kely et al . , 2008; Randel et al . , 2013 ) . When the rPRC is activated during helical swimming , the ciliary beating changes on the illuminated side , so that the larva reorients its trajectory towards the light source . Nectochaete larvae ( approximately 3\u20135 days post fertilization ) develop two pairs of adult eyes with several rPRCs coexpressing r-opsin1 , r-opsin3 and Go-opsin ( G\u00fchmann et al . , 2015; Randel et al . , 2013 ) . These eyes mediate visual phototaxis by comparing the intensity of light on the two sides of the body . The adult eyes and their downstream neuronal circuitry regulate the contraction of the longitudinal muscles of the trunk to steer the larva towards or away from a light source ( Randel et al . , 2014 ) . The function of cPRCs in Platynereis is much less clear . These and the surrounding cells ( the \u2018cPRC region\u2019 ) have been proposed to produce melatonin and to entrain the circadian clock ( Arendt et al . , 2004; Tosches et al . , 2014 ) . C-opsin1 was recently shown to absorb UV light . This suggests that the c-opsin1-expressing cPRCs mediate circadian entrainment by ambient UV light ( Tsukamoto et al . , 2017 ) . However , the precise\u00a0function of the cPRCs in Platynereis larvae and how they interact with rPRCs is still unknown . \n To identify synaptic connections between the cPRC and rPRC circuits , we used a serial-section transmission electron microscopy ( ssTEM ) dataset spanning the entire body of a 72 hr post fertilization ( hpf ) Platynereis larva ( Randel et al . , 2015 ) . Previously , we reported the synaptic connectome of the rPRCs from the visual eyes and eyespots , ( Randel et al . , 2015 , 2014 ) and the direct postsynaptic circuit of the four cPRCs with ramified cilia ( Williams et al . , 2017a ) . Briefly , the glutamatergic rPRCs of the adult eyes connect through three layers of interneurons to cholinergic motoneurons in the ventral head ( vMN ) that innervate longitudinal trunk muscles . The main premotor interneurons in this circuit are the Schn\u00f6rkel interneurons ( INsn ) ( Figure 1C , G ) ( Randel et al . , 2015; Randel et al . , 2014 ) . The rPRCs of the eyespot synapse directly on the ciliary band and the vMNs ( Figure 1G ) ( J\u00e9kely et al . , 2008; Randel et al . , 2015 , 2013 ) . The four cholinergic cPRCs send axons to the neurosecretory plexus in the anterior nervous system and synapse on four peptidergic/cholinergic RGW interneurons ( labelled INRGW , and named after the expression of the RGWamide neuropeptide [Shahidi et al . , 2015; Williams et al . , 2017] ) and four NOS interneurons ( labelled INNOS , and named after the expression of the nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) gene; unpublished ) . The cPRCs also synapse on a group of flask-shaped sensory-neurosecretory neurons that are part of the neurosecretory anterior nervous system . These cells express diverse neuropeptides but have no postsynaptic partners ( Williams et al . , 2017 ) . The RGW cells synapse on two serotonergic cells ( Ser-h1 ) that , together with their postsynaptic partner , the cholinergic MC neuron , are part of the ciliomotor circuitry of the larva ( Veraszt\u00f3 et al . , 2017 ) . To analyze the possible synaptic integration of the rPRC and cPRC circuits , we searched for all synaptic connections between neurons of these circuits ( Figure 1 ) in a synapse-level skeleton reconstruction of all cells in the larval head ( 2359 cells of which approximately 1230 are neurons; unpublished data ) . We did a systematic network search in Catmaid ( Schneider-Mizell et al . , 2016 ) for all possible synaptic paths ( two hops ) between the rPRC or the cPRC circuit . We identified three sites of contact . First , the RGW interneurons synapse on the Schn\u00f6rkel premotor interneurons ( INsn ) ( Figure 1E\u2013G and Video 1 ) . Second , we identified six interneurons ( INpreMN ) that are postsynaptic to the RGW interneurons and presynaptic to the ventral motoneurons ( vMNs ) of the visual circuit ( Figure 1E\u2013G ) . Third , two putative mechanosensory neurons bearing a sensory cilium and a collar of microvilli and located in the median head ( MS1 and MS2 ) ( Bezares-Calderon et al . , 2018 ) are postsynaptic to the RGW cells and presynaptic to the vMNs and INpro interneurons of the visual circuit ( Figure 1E\u2013G and Video 1 ) . Our graph search did not reveal any neurons that were directly postsynaptic to the rPRC circuit ( from rPRC to vMN ) and presynaptic to any neuron of the cPRC circuit . Thus , the cPRC circuit feeds hierarchically into the visual rPRC circuit ( Figure 1G ) . This suggests that the cPRCs could influence phototaxis , a behavior mediated by the rhabdomeric eyes and eyespots ( G\u00fchmann et al . , 2015; J\u00e9kely et al . , 2008; Randel et al . , 2014 ) . What is the role of cPRCs in larval behavior and how do they influence phototaxis ? First , to estimate the light sensitivity of the cPRCs , we reconstructed the morphology with ssTEM and measured the total sensory membrane surface-area of a cPRC ( Figure 2A\u2013D ) . Each cPRC has 12\u201315 basal bodies each with a root and an extensively branched sensory cilium . The branches are supported by single microtubule doublets ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Based on the average diameter and total length of all branches in one cPRC we estimated a membrane area of 276 \u03bcm2 , which is approximately 10 times smaller than the total disk membrane surface area of rat rods ( Mayhew and Astle , 1997 ) . This suggests that Platynereis cPRCs are sensitive enough to mediate acute light sensation . Next , we expressed Platynereis c-opsin1 in COS1 cells , reconstituted it with 11-cis-retinal and purified it . The reconstituted pigment absorbed in the UV range with a \u03bb-max of 384 nm in the dark spectrum and a \u03bb-max of 370 nm in the dark-light difference spectrum ( Figure 2E ) , in agreement with a recent report ( Tsukamoto et al . , 2017 ) . To investigate how the cPRCs respond to light , we did calcium imaging with larvae ubiquitously expressing the calcium sensor GCaMP6s ( Chen et al . , 2013; Veraszt\u00f3 et al . , 2017 ) . When imaged with a low-intensity 488 nm laser , the cPRCs had a high resting calcium level and the GCaMP6s signal highlighted their sensory cilia . We could thus identify the four cPRCs without stimulation ( Figure 2F ) . When the cPRC cilia were locally stimulated ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) for 5 min with 405 nm light ( 140\u2013250 times more photons on the sensory cilia than by the imaging laser ) , the calcium level dropped transiently at the cPRC somata and then increased strongly . This indicates transient cPRC hyperpolarization followed by depolarization . However , when the cPRCs were stimulated with a 488 nm laser of equal photon flux , they showed prolonged hyperpolarization only , without depolarization ( Figure 2G ) . When the 405 nm stimulation was switched off during the hyperpolarization phase ( after 20 s ) , the cPRCs still depolarized afterwards ( Figure 2H ) . 405 nm stimulation of the cPRCs also changed the activity of other neurons in the larval brain . Four neurons followed the activity pattern of the cPRCs ( Figure 2J; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . These cells correspond by position to the four RGW interneurons , which together with the four NOS interneurons are direct postsynaptic targets of the cPRCs ( Figure 1G ) ( Williams et al . , 2017a ) . Additionally , two flask-shaped sensory neurons ( SNearly ) in the middle of the anterior nervous system depolarized upon stimulus onset . Two further sensory cells ( SNlate ) flanking the SNearly cells depolarized later , in parallel with the rising phase of cPRC activity ( Figure 2I ) . These four SN cells correspond by position to four sensory-neurosecretory neurons that are postsynaptic to the cPRCs in the anterior nervous system ( SNMIP1l , SNASTC1r and two SNNS20 cells ) ( Figure 1D ) ( Williams et al . , 2017a ) . We next compared the responses of the RGW interneurons and the four SN neurons to 405 and 488 nm stimulation of the cPRCs . The RGW interneurons and the SNearly sensory neurons only responded to 405 nm stimulation ( with opposite sign ) but not to 488 nm stimulation . The SNlate neurons in some larvae also responded to 488 nm stimulation but these responses were weaker ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Thus , the cPRCs and their postsynaptic neurons respond differentially to violet and blue stimulation , with only violet light inducing cPRC depolarization and consistent changes in the activity of postsynaptic neurons . To characterize how Platynereis larvae react to UV-violet light , we assayed larval swimming behavior in a vertical column setup . Since Platynereis larvae show strong directional phototaxis to a broad spectrum of light ( between 380\u2013540 nm ) ( G\u00fchmann et al . , 2015; J\u00e9kely et al . , 2008 ) , we illuminated the setup equally from two opposite sides with non-directional UV light so that the larvae could not respond with directional phototaxis ( Figure 3A ) . When the larvae were stimulated with non-directional UV light , they started to swim downward . To characterize the wavelength dependence of this behavior , we assayed larvae in a vertical cuvette and stimulated them with monochromatic light of different wavelengths from two sides . The larvae swam down to UV-violet light ( between 340\u2013420 nm ) but not to longer wavelengths ( >420 nm , Figure 3B ) . This downward swimming UV-avoidance behavior to non-directional UV-violet light has not been previously reported in Platynereis . The observations that UV-avoidance can be triggered by non-directional light and has an action spectrum that closely matches the absorption spectrum of c-opsin1 ( Figure 2E ) suggest that the response is mediated by the non-pigmented cPRCs . If the cPRCs indeed mediate UV-avoidance , then the developmental onset of this response should correlate with the morphological differentiation of cPRCs . To test this , we assayed UV-avoidance ( 395 nm light from the side ) as well as phototaxis ( 480 nm light from the top ) at different larval stages ( Figure 3C ) and correlated the behaviors to photoreceptor differentiation . Phototaxis , but not UV-avoidance was already present at 27 hpf , at a stage when the larval eyespots are already functional ( J\u00e9kely et al . , 2008 ) . UV avoidance appeared at 36 hpf , approximately coinciding with the morphological differentiation of cPRCs ( after 32 hpf , as judged by the appearance of the ramified cilia ) ( Figure 3C ) , but long before the differentiation of the adult eyes ( at 72 hpf ) ( Fischer et al . , 2010; J\u00e9kely et al . , 2008; Randel et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , Platynereis larvae show UV-violet-light avoidance that is independent of phototaxis , can be induced by non-directional stimulus light , and is likely mediated by the UV-violet-responding non-pigmented cPRCs . To study how UV avoidance interacts with rhabdomeric-eye-mediated phototaxis , we stimulated the larvae in the vertical column with directional monochromatic light from above . When we used 380 nm stimulus light , both early- ( 41 hpf ) and late-stage ( 3 and 4 . 5 dpf ) larvae first swam upward towards the light ( for approximately one minute ) , and then swam downward ( Figure 3D , Video 2 ) . This upward phase was not observed when the larvae were illuminated uniformly from the side ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that the upward-swimming phase is phototaxis , which is then overwritten by the UV-avoidance response . To test the wavelength-dependence of this effect , we measured larval responses to different wavelengths of directional light coming from the top of the vertical column . We plotted responses 1 . 5\u20133 . 5 min after stimulus onset to focus on the phase when UV-avoidance has potentially overwritten phototaxis ( Figure 3D ) . In response to illumination with 340\u2013400 nm light , larvae swam downward after prolonged stimulation . In response to illumination with 440\u2013540 nm light ( early-stage ) or 440\u2013600 nm light ( late-stage ) , larvae swam upward ( Figure 3E ) . 420 nm light did not trigger the vertical displacement of the larvae . The swimming direction could be switched several times by changing the wavelength of the light from 380 nm to 520 nm ( Figure 3F ) , demonstrating that this behavioral switch does not habituate even after sustained exposure to light . These results indicate that directional UV-violet light first triggers upward-swimming phototaxis ( the pigmented eyes are sensitive in the UV-violet range [J\u00e9kely et al . , 2008;\u00a0G\u00fchmann et al . , 2015] ) , which is then overridden by the downward-swimming UV-avoidance response likely mediated by the cPRCs . Directional blue/cyan light only triggers phototaxis . Importantly , the switching in behavioral response cannot be explained as a wavelength-dependent alternation between positive and negative phototaxis , since early-stage larvae are exclusively positively phototactic ( J\u00e9kely et al . , 2008 ) ( until 72 hpf [Randel et al . , 2014] ) , yet already show the behavioral switch in swimming direction ( Figure 3E , F ) . Next we asked if the antagonistic phototaxis and UV-avoidance behaviors could form a potential mechanism to measure depth by the larvae . Since blue and UV-violet light attenuate differently in seawater , the ratio of blue to UV-violet light increases with depth ( field data from the Mediterranean , where our Platynereis strain comes from , were shown before [G\u00fchmann et al . , 2015] ) . Strong UV-violet light at the ocean\u2019s surface is expected to cause larvae to swim downward as an avoidance response , and relatively strong blue light in deeper waters is expected to trigger phototactic upward swimming . Such depth-dependent behavioral switching could form a ratio-chromatic depth-gauge ( Nilsson , 2009 ) . To test this , we exposed larvae to mixed wavelength light containing different photon ratios of UV ( 380 nm ) and blue ( 480 nm ) light coming from the top of the vertical column . At high 380/480 ratios , larvae swam downward , while at low ratios larvae swam upward . At a 40% 380/480 ratio , larvae remained at a constant average depth ( Figure 3G ) , despite being exposed to a directional light stimulus . Mixing the same intensity UV light as before with 660 nm red light ( a wavelength to which larvae do not respond phototactically at the intensity used ( Figure 3E ) ) did not induce upward swimming at any 380/660 ratio ( Figure 3G ) . This experiment shows that a reduction in UV intensity alone does not cause a switch in swimming direction . These results suggest that UV avoidance and phototaxis act antagonistically and cancel each other out under certain wavelength ratios , resulting in no net vertical swimming . This is consistent with the presence of a ratio-chromatic depth gauge in Platynereis larvae . To test whether c-opsin1 mediates the UV-violet response in Platynereis larvae , we used a c-opsin1 Platynereis knockout line generated by TALEN-mediated genome editing . The TALENs targeted the third exon of c-opsin1 and induced an 8 bp deletion ( Figure 4A ) . In homozygous c-opsin1\u03948/\u03948 larvae , the cPRCs had low resting calcium level and neither hyperpolarized nor depolarized upon 405 nm stimulation ( Figure 4B , C ) . Thus , c-opsin1 in the Platynereis cPRCs is required for an elevated resting calcium level in the dark state and for hyperpolarization and subsequent depolarization upon 405 nm exposure . The high resting calcium level in the cPRCs indicates a dark current , a characteristic of vertebrate rods and cones ( Hagins et al . , 1970 ) . Next , we tested behavioral responses to light in c-opsin1\u03948 mutant larvae . Similar to wild type larvae , homozygous c-opsin1\u03948/\u03948 larvae swim upward ( positive phototaxis ) in response to 480 nm light . However , c-opsin1\u03948/\u03948 larvae have a defective UV-avoidance response . Whereas wild type larvae swim downward after an initial upward-swimming phase , c-opsin1\u03948/\u03948 larvae continue to swim upward , showing sustained positive phototaxis in response to UV light ( Figure 4D ) . The magnitude of upward swimming diminishes , with close to 0 vertical displacement between 1 . 5\u20132 min after UV onset . This indicates that an additional , c-opsin1-independent UV-avoidance mechanism may exist in Platynereis larvae ( cf . the last bin under 480 and 395 nm stimulation ) . These results show that c-opsin1 is a critical mediator of UV-avoidance . The loss of c-opsin1 is expected to disrupt the depth gauge since in c-opsin1 mutants both cyan and UV light induce sustained positive phototactic behavior which is likely mediated by the pigmented eyes with a broad spectral sensitivity ( 380\u2013540 nm [J\u00e9kely et al . , 2008] ) . \n Our results are consistent with the presence of a ratio-chromatic depth-gauge in the planktonic larvae of Platynereis dumerilii . The depth gauge is formed by the antagonistic interaction of two distinct behaviors , mediated by two distinct types of photoreceptor systems with different spectral sensitivities . The rPRCs mediate phototaxis to a broad range of wavelengths between UV and green light , while the cPRCs mediate UV-violet avoidance . Under UV-violet light , after approximately 30 s the UV-violet avoidance response overrides an initial phototactic response . At a set UV/blue ratio , the two opposing behaviors cancel each other out . Due to the differential attenuation of UV and blue light in seawater , this mechanism could allow the larvae to stay at a certain depth in the ocean . While the function of the rPRCs in the larval and adult eyes has previously been described ( J\u00e9kely et al . , 2008; Randel et al . , 2014 ) , here we defined , both physiologically and behaviorally , the function of the cPRCs and unraveled how they interact with the rPRC system . The cPRCs express a UV-absorbing opsin , have a high resting calcium level and react by hyperpolarization and subsequent depolarization to violet light ( 405 nm ) . The cPRCs mediate an UV-violet avoidance response characterized by downward swimming . The action spectrum of this behavior matches the absorption spectrum of c-opsin1 and the response is severely impaired in c-opsin1 knockouts , demonstrating a critical role for c-opsin1 in mediating it . The depolarizing response in the cPRCs shows a similar delayed onset as UV-violet avoidance , suggesting that the behavior is due to cPRC depolarization . Intriguingly , the depolarization also occurs if the stimulus light is switched off during the hyperpolarizing phase . This implies that cPRC depolarization is not due to direct opsin activation but to a sustained cell-autonomous or non-autonomous signal . The activation of cPRCs also induces complex differential responses in postsynaptic neurons . The RGW cells follow the activity of cPRCs under violet but not blue illumination , whereas two groups of sensory neurons respond to violet light only ( SNearly ) or to both violet and , to a lesser extent , blue light ( SNlate ) . This implies that different postsynaptic mechanisms operate in the different cPRC targets . The high calcium level in the cPRCs suggests the possibility of the tonic release of a neurotransmitter ( probably acetylcholine ) in the dark , similar to the tonic release of glutamate by vertebrate photoreceptors ( Heidelberger et al . , 2005 ) . Blue illumination ( 488 nm ) also induces cPRC hyperpolarization , but no subsequent depolarization . This response may be mediated by another opsin expressed in the cPRCs . One candidate is c-opsin2 with a maximal absorption at 490 nm ( Ayers et al . , 2018 ) . One surprising observation is that cPRC hyperpolarization induced by violet or blue light has different downstream consequences . This may be due to the engagement of different signaling cascades by the different opsins . How cPRC activation and the postsynaptic responses lead to downward swimming during UV-avoidance is unclear . The cPRC circuit connects to the Ser-h1 serotonergic ciliomotor neurons ( Veraszt\u00f3 et al . , 2017 ) , suggesting that the modulation of ciliary activity may contribute to UV avoidance . In addition , we have genetic evidence implicating neuroendocrine volume transmission in UV avoidance . The cPRCs and their direct postsynaptic targets are part of the neurosecretory brain center of the larva ( Williams et al . , 2017a ) , and knocking out one neuroendocrine signaling component leads to strong defects in UV avoidance ( unpublished results ) . It also remains to be elucidated how the UV response overrides phototaxis at the neuronal level . We found that the cPRC circuit connects to the circuit of the rhabdomeric eyes via the cholinergic RGW interneurons and their distinct downstream synaptic pathways . The RGW neurons provide inputs to the phototactic circuit at the level of the INsn , INpro and the vMN cells . The strongest and most direct connection between the cPRC and rPRC circuits is through synapses from the RGW cells to the INsn neurons . Cholinergic input from the RGW cells to these premotor interneurons may antagonize phototaxis . Other sensory inputs may also tune phototaxis via the RGW-INsn pathway since neuropeptides derived from sensory-neurosecretory cells can influence RGW neuron activity ( Williams et al . , 2017 ) . The RGW neurons also connect to the putatively mechanosensory MS cells which strongly synapse on the vMNs . UV light may thus tune mechanosensation that may in turn modulate phototaxis . One outstanding question in eye evolution is why did the ciliary and rhabdomeric PRC types originally evolve ( Nilsson , 2013; 2009 ) ? Our findings suggest that the two types may have evolved antagonistic functions early in evolution . Invertebrates then elaborated on the rhabdomeric , and vertebrates on the ciliary type ( Arendt et al . , 2004 ) . According to one hypothesis , as the brain cPRCs were recruited for vision in the vertebrate lineage , the rPRCs evolved into the retinal ganglion cells ( Arendt , 2008; Arendt , 2003 ) . This scenario is supported by the expression of melanopsin , an r-opsin ortholog , in the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells ( Hattar et al . , 2003; 2002; Koyanagi et al . , 2005; Lucas et al . , 2001; Panda et al . , 2003 ) . Although we need more comparative data to test this model , we hypothesize that the cell-type mosaic of the vertebrate retina may have originated from the hierarchical integration of distinct cPRC and rPRC circuits mediating antagonistic behaviors , as observed in Platynereis larvae . \n Larvae of Platynereis dumerilii were cultured at 18\u00b0C in a 16 hr light 8 hr dark cycle until experiments . Larvae were raised to sexual maturity according to established breeding procedures ( Fischer and Dorresteijn , 2004; Hauenschild and Fischer , 1969 ) . We used serial-sectioning transmission electron microscopy to analyze cPRC sensory morphology ( Randel et al . , 2015 ) . Each cPRC has 12\u201315 basal bodies , each basal body gives rise to one cilium that branches close to its base to 3\u20139 branches . Each branch is supported by at least one microtubule doublet . The branches have an average diameter of 130 nm ( st . dev . 19 nm ) and a total length of 677 \u03bcm ( measured in one cPRC ) . This represents a total membrane surface area of approximately 276 \u03bcm2 . Recombinant c-opsin1 was purified and analyzed following ( Yokoyama , 2000 ) . Full-length Platynereis c-opsin1 was amplified with primers that introduced EcoRI , Kozak and SalI sequences , and cloned into the expression plasmid pMT5 . C-opsin1 was expressed in COS1 cells and incubated with 11-cis-retinal ( a gift from Dr . Rosalie K . Crouch at Storm Eye Institute ) to regenerate the photopigment . The pigment was purified with immobilized 1D4 ( The Culture Center , Minneapolis , MN ) in buffer W1 ( 50 mM N- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) piperazine-N\u2019\u22122-ethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ) ( pH 6 . 6 ) , 140 mM NaCl , 3 mM MgCl2 , 20% ( w/v ) glycerol and 0 . 1% dodecyl maltoside ) . The UV/VIS spectrum of the pigment was recorded at 20\u00b0C with a Hitachi U-3000 dual beam spectrophotometer . The pigment was bleached for 3 min with a 60 W standard light bulb equipped with a Kodak Wratten #3 filter at a distance of 20 cm . COS1 cells ( ATCC CRL1650 ) , established from the kidney cells of the African green monkey ( Cercopithecus aethiops ) , were authenticated by the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA ) with the COI assay . The mycoplasma contamination test was negative . We used a variety of light sources for photostimulation , depending on the experimental setup . In the calcium imaging experiments , we used the laser lines available in our Olympus FV1200 confocal microscope ( 405 and 488 nm; Showa Optronics , Tokyo ) . The lasers were operating in continuous mode . The power of the lasers was measured with a microscope slide power sensor ( S170C; Thorlabs , Newton , USA ) . The typical power for stimulation was 5 . 59 \u00b5watts for the 405 nm laser and 4 . 62 \u00b5watts for the 488 nm laser . These values correspond to 1 . 1e\u00a0+\u00a013 photons/sec . For behavioral assays , we used either UV LEDs ( 395 nm peak wavelength ) or a monochromator ( Polychrome II , Till Photonics ) for which we quantified photon irradiances across the spectrum ( 3\u22124 \u00d7 1018 photons/sec/m2 ) ( G\u00fchmann et al . , 2015 ) . We refer to color according to these wavelength ranges: UV\u00a0<400 nm , violet 400\u2013450 nm , blue 450\u2013490 nm ( 450\u2013460 royal blue ) , cyan 490\u2013520 nm . For calcium imaging , 36\u201352 hpf larvae were used . Experiments were conducted at room temperature in filtered natural seawater . Larvae were immobilized between a slide and a coverslip spaced with adhesive tape . GCaMP6s mRNA ( 1 mg/\u03bcl ) was injected into zygotes as described previously ( Randel et al . , 2014 ) . Larvae were imaged on an Olympus FV1200 microscope ( with a UPLSAPO 60X water-immersion objective , NA 1 . 2 ) with a frame rate of 1 . 25/sec and an image size of 254 \u00d7 254 pixels . The larvae were stimulated in a region of interest ( a circle with 18\u201324 pixel diameter ) with continuous 405 nm or 488 nm lasers controlled by the SIM scanner of the Olympus FV12000 confocal microscope while scanning . The imaging laser had a similar intensity than the stimulus laser but covered an area that was 140\u2013250 times larger than the stimulus ROI . The calcium-imaging movies were analyzed with Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) ( RRID:SCR_002285 ) and a custom Python script , as described previously ( G\u00fchmann et al . , 2015 ) , with the following modifications . The movies were motion-corrected in Fiji with moco ( Dubbs et al . , 2016 ) and Descriptor-based registration ( https://github . com/fiji/Descriptor_based_registration ) . The data are shown as \u0394F/F0 . For the calculation of the normalized \u0394F/F0 with a time-dependent baseline , F0 was set as the average of an area of the brain with no calcium activity to normalize for the additional lasers ( 405 nm and 488 nm ) and potential artefacts from the microscope's detector . Spatial correlation analyses of neuron activities were done in Fiji and Python as previously described ( Veraszt\u00f3 et al . , 2017 ) . The ROI was manually defined and was correlated with every pixel of the time\u00a0series . Finally , a single image was created with the Pearson correlation coefficients and a [\u22121 , 1] heatmap plot with two colors . Scripts are available at ( G\u00fchmann and Veraszt\u00f3 , 2018; copy archived\u00a0at\u00a0https://github . com/elifesciences-publications/Veraszto_et_al_2018 ) . Photoresponses of larvae of different ages were assayed in a vertical Plexiglas column ( 31 mm x 10 mm x 160 mm water height ) . The column was illuminated from above with light from a monochromator ( Polychrome II , Till Photonics ) . The monochromator was controlled by AxioVision 4 . 8 . 2 . 0 ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH ) via analog voltage or by a custom written Java program via the serial port . The light passed a collimator lens ( LAG-65 . 0\u201353 . 0 C with MgF2 Coating , CVI Melles Griot ) . The column was illuminated from both sides with light-emitting diodes ( LEDs ) . The LEDs on each side were grouped into two strips . One strip contained UV ( 395 nm ) LEDs ( SMB1W-395 , Roithner Lasertechnik ) and the other infrared ( 810 nm ) LEDs ( SMB1W-810NR-I , Roithner Lasertechnik ) . The UV LEDs were run at 4 V to stimulate the larvae in the column from the side . The infrared LEDs were run at 8 V ( overvoltage ) to illuminate the larvae for the camera ( DMK 22BUC03 , The Imaging Source ) , which recorded videos at 15 frames per second and was controlled by IC Capture ( The Imaging Source ) . 27-hour-old , 36-hour-old , 2-day-old , and 3-day-old Platynereis dumerilii larvae were stimulated in the column with UV ( 395 nm ) light from the LEDs on the side . Afterwards , the larvae were stimulated with monochromatic blue ( 480 nm ) light coming from above to assay for phototaxis . Each stimulus lasted 4 min . The LEDs were controlled manually and the monochromator ( Polychrome II , Till Photonics ) was controlled via AxioVision . To compare the behavior of wildtype and c-opsin1-knockout larvae in the vertical column , we tested individual batches of larvae . We distributed the larvae in the vertical column by mixing and dark adapted them for 5 min . The larvae were recorded for 1 min in the dark followed by exposure to collimated blue ( 480 nm ) light from the top of the column for 2 min , then 2 min darkness , and finally collimated UV ( 395 nm ) light from above for 2 min . Stimulus light was provided by a monochromator ( Polychrome II , Till Photonics ) . Early and late-stage Platynereis dumerilii larvae were assayed in the vertical columns . The larvae were stimulated six times alternatively with UV ( 380 nm ) and green ( 520 nm ) light . Each stimulus lasted 4 . 5 min . The last 3 min within each stimulus were analyzed for vertical displacement of the larvae . The light was provided by a monochromator ( Polychrome II , Till Photonics ) , which was controlled by AxioVision . 2-day-old and 3-day-old Platynereis dumerilii larvae were assayed in vertical columns . The larvae were stimulated with monochromatic light from above between 340 nm and 480 nm in 20 nm steps . Between the stimuli , additional 520 nm stimuli were introduced to avoid the accumulation of the larvae at the bottom after UV treatment . The larvae were also stimulated with monochromatic light from above between 400 nm and 680 nm in 20 nm steps . Between these stimuli , additional 400 nm stimuli were introduced to avoid the accumulation of the larvae at the top due to phototaxis . Each stimulus lasted 3 . 5 min . The last 2 min of each stimulus were analyzed for vertical displacement of the larvae . The light was provided by a monochromator ( Polychrome II , Till Photonics ) , which was controlled by AxioVision . 3-day-old Platynereis dumerilii larvae were stimulated with UV-blue ( 380 nm , 480 nm ) or UV-red ( 380 nm , 660 nm ) mixed light from above . The larvae were mixed to be uniformly distributed in the column and dark adapted for 5 min . In each step , 10% UV-light was replaced by blue or red light . Each step was followed by a blue ( 480 nm ) light stimulus to avoid the accumulation of the larvae at the bottom after UV treatment . Different ratios were created by rapidly switching between wavelengths within 500 ms periods ( e . g . , for a 10% UV 90% blue ratio we provided UV-light for 50 ms followed by blue light for 450 ms ) . Each stimulus condition lasted 4 min . The monochromator was controlled by a custom Java program via the serial port . 2-day-old Platynereis dumerilii larvae were assayed in a vertical cuvette of 10 mm x 10 mm x 42 mm ( L x W x H ) . The larvae were kept at 18\u00b0C and had been exposed to daylight before the experiment . The larvae were illuminated with a monochromator ( Polychrome II , Till Photonics ) from one side of the cuvette . A mirror ( PFSQ20-03-F01 , Thorlabs ) placed at the opposite side reflected the light to provide near-uniform bilateral illumination . The light passed a diffuser ( \u00d81\u2019 20\u00b0 Circle Pattern Diffuser , ED1-C20; Thorlabs ) and a collimating lens ( LAG-65 . 0\u201353 . 0 C with MgF2 Coating , CVI Melles Griot ) before it hit the cuvette . The cuvette was illuminated with infrared ( 850 nm ) light-emitting diodes ( LEDs ) ( L2 \u00d7 2-I3CA , Roithner Lasertechnik ) from the side . The LEDs were run at 6 . 0 V . The larvae were stimulated with light from 340 nm to 560 nm in 20 nm steps . Each step lasted 1 min . The steps were separated by 1 min darkness , so that the larvae could redistribute after each stimulus . The larvae were recorded at 16 frames per second with a DMK 23GP031 camera ( The Imaging Source ) controlled by IC Capture . The camera was equipped with a macro objective ( Macro Zoomatar 1:4/50\u2013125 mm , Zoomar Muenchen ) . It was mounted with a close-up lens ( +2 52 mm , D\u00f6rr close-up lens set 368052 ) . The larvae were tracked and their vertical displacement was analyzed during the last 45 s of each stimulus period . Scripts are available at ( G\u00fchmann and Veraszt\u00f3 , 2018 ) . The genomic region of c-opsin1 was amplified to screen for putative size-polymorphic alleles or single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) from different Platynereis strains ( PIN and VIO strains ) with the following screening primers: cops1_F1/R1 , cops1_F2/R2 , cops1_F3/R3 , cops1_F4/R4 and cops1_F5/R5 ( For a detailed protocol for SNP screening see: ( Bannister et al . , 2014 ) . c-opsin1 TALEN pairs were designed in several non-polymorphic exon regions with the TALE-NT prediction tool ( TAL Effector Nucleotide Targeter 2 . 0; https://tale-nt . cac . cornell . edu/ ) ( Doyle et al . , 2012 ) . The in silico predictions were done with customized design conditions - 15 left/right Repeat Variable Diresidue ( RVD ) length , 15\u201325 bp spacer length , G substitute by NN RVD and presence of a restriction enzyme site within the spacer region . The predicted c-opsin1 TALENs were constructed in vitro with the Golden Gate assembly protocol ( Golden Gate TAL Effector Kit 2 . 0 , Addgene #1000000024 ) ( Cermak et al . , 2011 ) . The final TALEN repeats were cloned to heterodimeric FokI expression plasmids pCS2TAL3-DD for left TALEN array and pCS2TAL3-RR for right TALEN array ( Dahlem et al . , 2012 ) . All cloned TALEN plasmids were sequence-verified with the TAL_F1 and TAL_R2 primers . c-opsin1 TALEN mRNA for each array was generated by linearizing the corresponding plasmid ( NotI ) and transcribing it in vitro with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE Sp6 kit ( Thermofisher ) . 200 ng/\u03bcl/TALEN mRNA was microinjected into Platynereis zygotes ( Backfisch et al . , 2013 ) and screened for TALEN-induced mutations ( Bannister et al . , 2014 ) with the PCR primers cops1_TAL_R1/cops1_TAL_L2 followed by restriction digest by the BanI enzyme for the TAL_pair3 and MluC1 for the TAL_pair4 . The injected embryos were raised to maintain knockout cultures . For genotyping of the c-opsin1 locus , genomic DNA was isolated from single larvae , groups of 6\u201320 larvae , or from the tails of adult worms . The DNA was amplified by PCR with the cops1_del8m_F/cops1_com_R or the cops1_ del8_2F/cops1_ del8_2R primers with the dilution protocol of the Phusion Human Specimen Direct PCR Kit ( Thermo Scientific ) . The PCR product was sequenced directly with a nested sequencing primer cops1_ nest_seq . A mixture of wild-type and deletion alleles in a sample gave double peaks in the sequencing chromatograms , with the relative height of the double peaks reflecting the relative allele ratio in the sample ."}

This eventually destroys the infected cells and weakens the ability of a person with HIV to fight off infections and disease . If diagnosed early and treated , most people with HIV now live long and healthy lives and do not develop AIDS\u2014the last stage of HIV infection when previously harmless , opportunistic infections can become life-threatening . However , there are still numerous hurdles and challenges that must be overcome before a cure for HIV/AIDS can be developed . Treatment with drugs called antiretrovirals can reduce the amount of the HIV virus circulating in an infected person's bloodstream to undetectable levels . However , when HIV infects a cell , the virus inserts a copy of its genetic material into the cell's DNA\u2014and , for most patients , antiretroviral treatment does not tackle these \u2018hidden viruses\u2019 . As such , and in spite of their side-effects , antiretroviral drugs have to be taken for life in case the hidden viruses re-emerge . As research into a cure for HIV/AIDS gathers momentum , patients who might be candidates for new experimental treatments will need to be identified . Although it is not recommended as part of standard clinical care , the only way to test if a patient's viral levels would remain suppressed without the drugs would be to temporarily stop the treatment under the close supervision of a physician . As such , a new method is needed to identify if there are patients who might benefit from stopping antiretroviral therapy , and more importantly , those who might not . Williams , Hurst et al . have now tested whether measuring the levels of HIV DNA directly might help to predict if , and when , the virus might re-emerge ( or rebound ) . In a group of HIV patients participating in a clinical trial , those with higher levels of HIV DNA at the point that the treatment was stopped were found to experience faster viral rebound than those with lower levels of HIV DNA . This method could therefore identify those patients who are at the greatest risk of HIV viral rebound , and are therefore unlikely to benefit if their treatment is interrupted . Williams , Hurst et al . also found that measuring the levels of HIV DNA could help to predict how the disease would progress in treated and untreated patients . Furthermore , these predictions were more accurate than those based on measuring the amount of the virus circulating in a patient's body . The next challenge is to identify other methods to distinguish patients who may remain \u2018virus-free\u2019 for a period without treatment , from those who would not . With this achieved , it might be possible to identify the mechanisms that determine why the virus comes back and so develop new treatments to stop this happening . This would make developing a cure for HIV/AIDS a much more tangible prospect .", "source": "In HIV-1 infection , a population of latently infected cells facilitates viral persistence despite antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . With the aim of identifying individuals in whom ART might induce a period of viraemic control on stopping therapy , we hypothesised that quantification of the pool of latently infected cells in primary HIV-1 infection ( PHI ) would predict clinical progression and viral replication following ART . We measured HIV-1 DNA in a highly characterised randomised population of individuals with PHI . We explored associations between HIV-1 DNA and immunological and virological markers of clinical progression , including viral rebound in those interrupting therapy . In multivariable analyses , HIV-1 DNA was more predictive of disease progression than plasma viral load and , at treatment interruption , predicted time to plasma virus rebound . HIV-1 DNA may help identify individuals who could safely interrupt ART in future HIV-1 eradication trials .

Once HIV-1 has infected a cell and integrated its genome into the cellular DNA , that cell may revert to a resting state , only producing replication competent virions when activated at a later date . These cells have been labeled the \u2018HIV reservoir\u2019 . There is , however , a lack of clarity relating to the cell types that might harbour the \u2018reservoir\u2019 , as well as the tissues in which these cells might be located . For clarity , we will use the term \u2018reservoir\u2019 to describe the population of HIV-1-infected cells that persist during ART and which are the source of rebound viraemia on stopping therapy . Current understanding is that the majority of cells comprising this reservoir are CD4 T memory cells of a resting phenotype ( Avettand-Fenoel et al . , 2009; Liszewski et al . , 2009; Eriksson et al . , 2013 ) . Many assays have been developed to quantify the HIV-1 reservoir , ranging from simple quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) estimation of cell associated HIV-1 DNA to labour-intensive viral outgrowth assays ( VOA ) ( Siliciano and Siliciano , 2005; Avettand-Fenoel et al . , 2009; Liszewski et al . , 2009; Eriksson et al . , 2013 ) . Whereas measurement of plasma viraemia ( \u2018viral load\u2019 ) and CD4 T cell count are documented surrogate markers of HIV clinical progression , the clinical relevance and utility of measuring the reservoir\u2014regardless of assay\u2013remains less clear . As cell-associated HIV-1 DNA precedes plasma viraemia in the viral life cycle , it is tantalizing to speculate whether measuring HIV-1 DNA ( as a surrogate for reservoir size ) might have significant clinical relevance . It is well documented that HIV-1 DNA persists in patients on antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) even when the plasma viral load is undetectable using the most sensitive assays ( Palmer et al . , 2008; Saez-Cirion et al . , 2013 ) . Much of this detectable HIV-1 DNA has been found to be mutated and replication-incompetent calling into question its biological relevance ( Ho et al . , 2013 ) . However , as a simple surrogate measure of the reservoir it may still have a role to play . As new interventions to cure HIV-1 infection are developed and taken into clinical trials , a means to measure their efficacy is needed . Stopping ART to await the return of viraemia would be the \u2018gold standard\u2019 approach , but has been associated with risk in certain ( Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy ( SMART ) Study Group et al . , 2006 ) , although not all studies ( SPARTAC Trial Investigators et al . , 2013 ) . Ideally , the clinician would have access to an algorithm of biomarker assays to help identify those patients who might ( or , alternatively , should not ) be candidates for a safe treatment interruption ( TI ) . The best way to assess the patient successfully managed on ART is unclear but , with the viral load rendered undetectable , it is plausible that HIV-1 DNA might be an alternative biomarker for disease progression . For example , compared with individuals with uncontrolled viraemia , HIV-1 DNA levels are much lower in cohorts such as VISCONTI in which apparently persistent aviraemia has been reported following TI ( Saez-Cirion et al . , 2013 ) , and in the case of the Mississippi baby extremely low DNA levels were associated with a prolonged period of virological remission . However , this contrasts with cases in which undetectable DNA on ART was associated with prompt rebound viraemia on stopping ( Chun et al . , 2010; Henrich et al . , 2014 ) . We therefore wished to gain a broader picture of the utility of measuring HIV-1 DNA levels by studying participants in a large , randomized trial of primary HIV-1 infection . We measured both Total and Integrated HIV DNA levels in peripheral blood CD4 T cells in participants in the Short Pulse Antiretroviral Treatment at HIV-1 Seroconversion ( SPARTAC ) trial ( SPARTAC Trial Investigators et al . , 2013 ) \u2013the largest randomized clinical trial of short-course ART in primary HIV-1 infection ( PHI ) . Studying individuals recruited at PHI , randomized to no treatment or ART , and who subsequently underwent treatment interruption , allowed us to ask two questions . Was HIV-1 DNA independently predictive of clinical progression , and did HIV-1 DNA predict the time taken for viraemic rebound on stopping therapy , advocating its role in future treatment interruption protocols ? \n 154 participants across all the SPARTAC trial arms were studied based on infection with subtype B HIV-1 and sample availability . All 154 patients were sampled at the pre-therapy baseline at trial enrolment . The demographics of the 154 participants are shown in Table 1 . Participants who were randomised to receive no therapy or 48 weeks of ART and for whom samples were available ( n = 51 and n = 47 , respectively; Supplementary file 1 ) were studied in separate analyses described below . Assays of both Total and Integrated HIV-1 DNA were conducted at pre-therapy \u2018baseline\u2019 ( trial week 0 ) and then at weeks 12 , 48 , 52 , 60 and 108 , where samples permitted . As detailed in Supplementary file 2 , not all patients were assayed at all time-points , dependent on the analyses being conducted and sample availability . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03821 . 003Table 1 .

A subset of these patients ( Supplementary files 1 and 2 ) was used for analyses at later time-points . Traditionally , plasma viral load ( VL ) ( Mellors et al . , 1996 ) and CD4 cell count ( Frater et al . , 2014 ) are the only validated surrogate markers of progression used in the HIV-1 clinic . We therefore measured these biomarkers as well as HIV-1 DNA in 154 SPARTAC participants at enrolment to the trial and prior to any ART being given . The median ( interquartile range ) values of Total and Integrated HIV-1 DNA values in PHI ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) were 7707 ( 2477\u201318187 ) and 3830 ( 1563\u20136325 ) copies of HIV-1 DNA per million CD4 T cells , respectively . Total and Integrated HIV-1 DNA levels were closely associated ( p < 0 . 0001; r2 = 0 . 72; Pearson correlation ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) in these pre-therapy samples . Total and Integrated HIV-1 DNA were significantly associated with plasma viral load ( both p < 0 . 001; r2 = 0 . 48 and 0 . 64 , respectively; linear regression ) ( Figure 1A ) , and inversely with CD4 T cell count ( both p < 0 . 001; r2 = 0 . 20 and 0 . 27 , respectively; linear regression ) ( Figure 1B ) . Interestingly , the estimated time since seroconversion at recruitment did not correlate with HIV-1 DNA ( both Integrated and Total ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03821 . 004Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03821 . 007 For this analysis , disease progression was defined according to the primary end-point of the SPARTAC trial , that is , a composite end-point of either a CD4 T cell count of 350 cells/\u00b5l or the commencement of long-term ART ( for any clinical determined decision ) ( SPARTAC Trial Investigators et al . , 2013 ) . We carried out Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analyses with patients randomised to receive no ART , and stratified according to median HIV-1 DNA level at time of recruitment ( n = 51 for Total HIV-1 DNA , and n = 38 for Integrated [due to limited sample availability] ) ( patient demographics detailed in Supplementary file 1 ) . There was a significant delay in clinical progression in those with lower Total and Integrated HIV-1 DNA at baseline ( p = 0 . 0016 and 0 . 0022 , respectively; log-rank test ) ( Figure 2 ) . The median time from randomization to primary endpoint stratified by low and high Total HIV-1 DNA levels was 187 . 0 ( IQR 127 . 0\u2013222 . 0 ) and 77 . 9 ( IQR 35 . 0\u2013172 . 8 ) weeks , respectively , and for low and high Integrated levels was 187 . 7 ( IQR 132 . 7\u2013214 . 9 ) and 52 . 0 ( IQR 32 . 4\u2013161 . 3 ) weeks , respectively . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03821 . 008Figure 2 .

HIV-1 DNA data was divided into two \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 at the median level , which was 4 . 02 and 3 . 61 copies HIV-1 DNA per million CD4 T cells for Total and Integrated , respectively . Significance was determined by log rank test . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03821 . 008 Univariable Cox analyses showed Total HIV-1 DNA ( HR 4 . 16 per log10 increase [CI 2 . 10\u20138 . 26]; p < 0 . 0001 ) , Integrated HIV-1 DNA ( HR 5 . 41 per log10 increase ( CI 1 . 65\u201318 . 04 ) ; p = 0 . 006 ) and plasma viral load ( HR 1 . 74 per log10 increase ( CI 1 . 13\u20132 . 68 ) p = 0 . 011 ) predicted the trial primary endpoint ( Table 2 ) . Multivariable analyses were carried out with the baseline covariates , Total HIV-1 DNA , viral load , and CD4 T cell count . Here , Total HIV-1 DNA ( HR = 3 . 57 ( 1 . 58\u20138 . 08 ) ; p = 0 . 002 ) and CD4 count ( HR = 0 . 67 ( 0 . 53\u20130 . 84 ) ; p < 0 . 001 ) , but not plasma viral load ( HR = 1 . 25 ( 0 . 80\u20131 . 95 ) ; p = 0 . 33 ) predicted time to primary endpoint ( Table 2 ) . In a similar multivariable analysis , Integrated DNA did not associate significantly with the trial endpoint . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03821 . 009Table 2 .

Progression was determined according to reaching the SPARTAC trial primary endpoint ( Chun et al . , 2010 ) . Co-variables analysed were baseline ( i . e . first pre-therapy trial sample ) Total HIV-1 DNA , baseline plasma viral load and baseline CD4+ T cell count . One third of the participants recruited to SPARTAC were randomised according to the trial protocol to receive 48 weeks of ART before undertaking a treatment interruption ( SPARTAC Trial Investigators et al . , 2013 ) . This allowed us not only to study the impact of ART on HIV-1 DNA levels in this cohort ( which has been reported in different cohorts [Siliciano et al . , 2003; Chun et al . , 2007] ) , but also to characterise what happens on stopping therapy after treatment initiated during PHI . Prior to starting ART , Total and Integrated HIV-1 DNA levels were significantly different ( p < 0 . 0001; Students t test ) ( Figure 3 ) , most likely explained by the presence of unintegrated circular and linear DNA forms . As expected , HIV-1 DNA levels after 48 weeks of ART were significantly lower than those measured at baseline ( p < 0 . 0001 for all comparisons; Students t test ) by 0 . 63 log copies/million CD4 cells for Total , and 0 . 59 log copies/million CD4 cells for Integrated ( Figure 3 ) . After 48 weeks of ART , Total DNA levels remained significantly greater than Integrated levels in patients despite undetectable viraemia ( 0 . 027; paired t test ) ( Figure 3 ) . This is consistent with other reports of residual unintegrated HIV-1 DNA up to a year after ART initiation ( Agosto et al . , 2011 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03821 . 010Figure 3 . Analysis of impact on HIV-1 DNA of antiretroviral therapy . Total and Integrated HIV-1 DNA levels and plasma viral load ( HIV-1 RNA ) were measured at Week 0 \u2018baseline\u2019 ( in participants from all three trial arms prior to any therapy ) and also in those receiving 48 weeks of ART ( weeks 48 , 52 , 60 and 108 after baseline ) . DNA levels ( log10 copies/million CD4 T cells ) and viral load ( log10 copies/ml plasma ) were measured at all time-points , but not all participants were sampled at all time-points dependent on sample availability . Significance was determined by unpaired Students t Tests or paired t test ( marker with * ) when samples at the two time-points being compared were matched .

Total HIV-1 DNA levels were calculated in 15 patients on ART before TI ( pre-TI ) These patients subsequently started long-term ART ( ltx ) . DNA was sampled at least 6 months post ltx start date . Significance was established using a paired students t test . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03821 . 011 Having ascertained that in untreated individuals HIV-1 DNA was a predictor of progression , we now asked whether the lower HIV-1 DNA levels following ART would predict progression if therapy was stopped . This has potentially greater utility , as the majority of individuals on successful ART will have undetectable plasma viraemia using standard assays . We measured DNA levels in participants who received a median of 48 ( IQR 47 . 7\u201348 . 7 ) weeks of ART with successfully suppressed viraemia ( VL < 50 copies/ml plasma ) , immediately prior to treatment interruption . The demographics of the subset of individuals ( n = 47 ) studied in this analysis are detailed in Supplementary file 1 . Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analyses were undertaken in which participants were again divided into two groups ( low and high ) based on median HIV-1 DNA levels at TI . Both low Total and Integrated HIV-1 DNA levels associated with a longer time to trial endpoint ( p = 0 . 039 and 0 . 031 , respectively; log-rank test ) ( Figure 4 ) . The median time from TI to primary endpoint stratified by low and high Total HIV-1 DNA levels was 159 . 2 ( IQR 111 . 9\u2013200 . 6 ) and 117 . 8 ( IQR 67 . 8\u2013173 . 8 ) weeks , respectively , and by low and high Integrated levels was 166 ( IQR 124 . 9\u2013200 . 6 ) and 101 . 1 ( IQR 65 . 5\u2013156 . 8 ) weeks , respectively . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03821 . 012Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03821 . 012 In univariable Cox regression analyses , Total and Integrated HIV-1 DNA both predicted clinical progression from TI , determined by time to reaching the trial primary endpoint ( Total HR 3 . 52 [1 . 32\u20139 . 37]; p = 0 . 012; Integrated HR 3 . 01 ( 1 . 13\u20137 . 95 ) ; p = 0 . 027 ) . Multivariable cox regression models were constructed with HIV-1 DNA and CD4 cell count at TI . Viral load was not included as it was undetectable at TI . Both Integrated ( HR 2 . 81 CI ( 1 . 05\u20137 . 55 ) p = 0 . 04 ) and Total ( HR 3 . 42 CI ( 1 . 29\u20139 . 05 ) p = 0 . 013 ) HIV-1 DNA retained significance , and in both cases CD4 T cell count at TI was not a significant predictor ( HR 1 . 04 CI ( 0 . 83\u20131 . 11 ) p = 0 . 58 and HR 0 . 94 CI 0 . 825\u20131 . 08 p = 0 . 4 ) . At TI , HIV-1 DNA was the only predictor of the primary end point . One of the concerns around the viral rebound following a TI is the risk of \u2018re-seeding\u2019 the reservoir in individuals who might have extremely low HIV-1 DNA levels , and who might be candidates for \u2018post-treatment control\u2019 of viraemia ( Hocqueloux et al . , 2010 ) . We therefore measured HIV-1 DNA in those participants who had received 48 weeks of ART at the point of TI and then again 4 , 12 and 60 weeks post TI , where samples were available . Total and Integrated HIV-1 DNA levels were not significantly greater than at the time of ART cessation for up to 12 weeks post TI , although had significantly increased 60 weeks after TI ( p < 0 . 0001 for Total and Integrated DNA; Students t test ) , returning approximately to the Week 0 pre-therapy levels ( Figure 3 ) . The increase in Total and Integrated HIV-1 DNA 4 weeks after TI was not significant ( p = 0 . 30 ) , in contrast to the rebound in plasma viraemia ( p < 0 . 001 ) , which may be re-assuring for those implementing a TI strategy in which ART would be re-introduced when plasma VL became detectable . Of note , in an analysis of those individuals who subsequently restarted ART after the TI\u2013and for whom we had samples ( n = 15 ) \u2013there was no significant difference between the HIV-1 reservoir size pre-TI and at least 6 months after re-starting ART ( p = 0 . 58; paired students t test; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , suggesting that any increase in HIV-1 DNA on stopping ART may be reversible if therapy is re-commenced . However , larger studies will be needed to confirm these data . Although almost all participants in SPARTAC experienced VL rebound on stopping ART , we have previously shown that of those who received >12 weeks of therapy , 14% still had undetectable viraemia 12 months later ( Stohr et al . , 2013 ) . We therefore wished to establish\u2014albeit in this different , although overlapping , sub-group of SPARTAC participants\u2014whether HIV-1 DNA predicted the return of plasma viraemia post-TI . As our previous findings included participants in centres using both 50 and 400 copies/ml as the lower limit of detection for plasma viral load assays , we studied both cut-offs for the HIV-1 DNA analyses . No patients were censored before viral rebound was detected and all were aviraemic ( <50 copies/ml plasma ) at the point of stopping ART . Levels of Total ( but not Integrated ) HIV-1 DNA at TI predicted time to viral rebound to 400 copies/ml by univariable Cox regression analysis ( HR 2 . 43 ( 1 . 23\u20134 . 79 ) p = 0 . 010 ) . CD4 T cell count at TI was not predictive ( HR 0 . 92 ( 0 . 78\u20131 . 08 ) p = 0 . 32 ) ( Supplementary file 3 ) . In a multivariable Cox regression model including Total HIV-1 DNA and CD4 count , both sampled at the point of TI , only Total HIV-1 DNA significantly predicted time to viral rebound to 400 copies ( HR 2 . 68 [1 . 31\u20135 . 48] p = 0 . 0069 ) ( Supplementary file 3 ) . When using values from pre-therapy baseline rather than at the time of TI in the model , neither plasma viral load nor CD4 T cell count predicted time to viral rebound ( >400 copies/ml ) from TI ( HR 1 . 38 [0 . 96\u20131 . 99] p = 0 . 080 ) and ( HR 1 . 03 [0 . 92-1 . 12] p = 0 . 60 ) , respectively . Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analyses showed similar results , with a low Total HIV-1 DNA ( based on stratification around the median level ) associated with a slower time to a viral rebound of 400 copies/ml ( p = 0 . 0038; log-rank test ) but not to 50 copies per ml ( p = 0 . 18 ) ( Figure 5 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03821 . 013Figure 5 . HIV-1 DNA at ART interruption predicts time to viral rebound . Survival analyses of time to viral rebound ( weeks ) in participants undertaking TI after 48 weeks of ART . HIV-1 DNA levels are presented divided at the median level into high ( red ) and low ( black ) . Rebound to 400 HIV-1 RNA copies ( n = 46 ) is presented for Total ( A ) and Integrated ( B ) HIV-1 DNA . Rebound to 50 HIV-1 RNA copies ( n = 45 ) is presented for Total ( C ) and Integrated ( D ) HIV-1 DNA . Significance was determined by log rank test . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03821 . 013 It was unclear why Total HIV-1 DNA should predict rebound to 400 copies but not to 50 . In an attempt to explain this we studied those individuals with data available at both cut-offs . In this small post-hoc analysis ( n = 45 ) , we found that rebound varied according to the HIV-1 DNA level at the time of TI . Patients with high Total HIV-1 DNA levels were more likely to have a first detectable VL greater than 400 copies/ml , whereas those with lower HIV-1 DNA levels were more likely initially to rebound below 400 but above 50 copies/ml ( p = 0 . 0074; Fisher's exact test ) ( Supplementary file 4 ) . In summary , we find evidence that HIV-1 DNA is a significant predictor of the duration of viral remission and magnitude of the initial rebound following TI . This , if confirmed in larger studies , would have implications for those designing protocols for ART-reintroduction following viral rebound in TI studies . \n Since first described nearly two decades ago a persistent reservoir of HIV-1-infected cells remains the main reason that HIV-1 infection cannot be cured ( Chun et al . , 1997; Finzi et al . , 1997; Wong et al . , 1997 ) . The simplest measure of the reservoir is a qPCR assay that detects all intracellular HIV-1 DNA regardless of whether it is integrated into host chromosomes or is in unintegrated linear or circular forms . A modification of this assay incorporates an initial step to prime host Alu repeats in order to quantify only viral DNA that has been integrated into host DNA . These assays are open to criticism as the vast majority of intracellular HIV-1 DNA is thought to be replication incompetent , and qPCR is not able to discriminate between replication competent and incompetent viral DNA genomes . This has led to the development of alternative approaches such as viral outgrowth assays ( which are considered the gold standard , but are expensive and time-consuming , even with recent improvements to their protocols [Laird et al . , 2013] ) and assays to measure intracellular HIV-1 RNA , which may more accurately reflect an infected cell's ability to produce new virions , especially under conditions where viral transcription is stimulated ( Bullen et al . , 2014 ) . Despite the debate over the biological relevance of measuring HIV-1 DNA\u2014and bearing in mind that none of these assays have been standardised for clinical use\u2013a number of reports have attributed clinical meaning to HIV-1 DNA assays . Over a decade ago Tierney and colleagues suggested that proviral DNA in PBMCs from 111 participants receiving limited nucleoside analogue therapy was an independent predictor of clinical progression , although it is unclear how suppressive the ART regimes were in this study ( Tierney et al . , 2003 ) . Havlir et al studied 100 individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection and viral suppression on ART and showed that HIV-1 DNA independently predicted residual viraemia on ART ( Havlir et al . , 2005 ) . However there has not been a comprehensive analysis of both HIV-1 Total and Integrated HIV-1 DNA in individuals randomised to treatment or no treatment soon after seroconversion . We applied both Total and Integrated DNA measures to a unique cohort of individuals with evidence of PHI randomised to immediate interrupted ART or no therapy with longitudinal follow-up for a median of 4 . 5 years . As participants were randomised to different short course ART therapies prior to TI , we were able to determine how well HIV-1 DNA correlated with accepted surrogate markers of progression such as VL and CD4 count , and also whether HIV-1 DNA was an independent predictor of disease progression within the SPARTAC trial in both treated and untreated participants . Our first finding that HIV-1 DNA associated closely with both plasma VL and CD4 cell counts ( Figure 1 ) was not surprising as this is reported elsewhere ( Chun et al . , 2010; Parisi et al . , 2012 ) . Our findings that both baseline and pre-TI HIV-1 DNA strongly predicted the trial primary endpoint ( Figure 4 and Table 2 ) are supported by data from other smaller , discrete observational studies , in which low HIV-1 DNA levels associated with a longer time to clinical progression ( Goujard et al . , 2006; Minga et al . , 2008; Piketty et al . , 2010 ) , a lower viral set point and reduced chance of virological failure on ART re-initiation ( Yerly et al . , 2004 ) at PHI . We are aware of one other report associating HIV-1 DNA with time to viral rebound on stopping ART ( Yerly et al . , 2004 ) . In this study Yerly and colleagues studied chronically-infected individuals with sequential treatment interruptions and reported that DNA was a predictor of the peak of viraemia following therapy cessation and failure to reach undetectable viraemia on re-starting ART\u2013they do not report on the actual duration of viral suppression after TI . In a smaller study at PHI , Lafeuillade et al also associated HIV-1 DNA with time to rebound , however this study is complicated by other interventions such as IL-2 and hydroxyurea in addition to ART ( Lafeuillade et al . , 2003 ) . We measured plasma viral load in the pre-therapy \u2018baseline\u2019 sample closest to the estimated time of infection . One possible criticism\u2014and explanation for why plasma VL was less predictive in this study\u2014is that other studies have associated progression with the \u2018set-point\u2019 viral load , the value at which the VL stabilizes following the dynamic PHI stage . However , in our untreated participants we found that the \u2018baseline\u2019 and \u2018set-point\u2019 VL values were highly correlated , although the former was higher , as would be expected ( data not shown ) . From a clinical perspective , it is worth noting that if individuals with PHI are commenced on ART immediately , then their \u2018set-point\u2019 VL will not be known , potentially placing greater impact on the less dynamic HIV-1 DNA measure . After TI , we observed a period of at least 12 weeks where no significant increases in the HIV-1 reservoir level were detected by both assays ( Figure 3 ) . However , we found little evidence of longer term post-treatment control ( Persaud et al . , 2013; Saez-Cirion et al . , 2013 ) , as levels of HIV-1 DNA 1-year after therapy interruption were not significantly different to that seen at pre-therapy baseline . Nevertheless , the potential for there to be a short window period during which plasma viraemia has rebounded but HIV-1 DNA levels have not risen significantly is encouraging , if future closely-monitored TI studies are to be undertaken . Concerns around \u2018re-seeding\u2019 the reservoir are very real , and it is important that any possible harm associated with a TI is limited . It is therefore also re-assuring that in our admittedly small sub-study , re-initiation of ART subsequently restored HIV-1 DNA to pre-TI levels . Finally , a low \u2018Total\u2019 HIV-1 reservoir at TI resulted in a longer time to a viral rebound to 400 copies/ml ( Figure 5 ) . In univariable and multivariable Cox regression models Total HIV-1 DNA at TI predicted time to rebound to 400 copies/ml , whereas CD4 T cell count did not ( Supplementary file 3 ) . Of interest , the baseline VL and CD4 prior to therapy were also not predictive of time to rebound . In contrast to other studies exploring TI , we have a larger and randomly allocated patient group who have received similar durations of ART at PHI and hence can be directly compared . Although viral rebound was observed in all individuals after TI ultimately , this is the first report of a randomised cohort that has shown that time to viral rebound and primary study end point could be predicted by HIV-1 DNA measurement at TI . Our findings of an association with HIV-1 DNA and time to viral rebound raise a number of other questions . Why was Total DNA predictive of rebound but not Integrated ? Why was Total DNA predictive for rebound to 400 copies/ml but not 50 copies/ml ? Much larger studies will be needed to answer most of these questions , however our sub-analysis of rebounding patients suggested that a high Total DNA at TI was more indicative of a higher VL rebound ( i . e . >400 copies ) , whereas a low DNA level was not associated with a lower rebound . These data might indicate that a Total DNA level at TI is better at predicting the patients who will be quick to rebound rather than those who will maintain suppression . A question for larger studies to answer will be to define what the viral load cut-off should be for considering rebound , rather than just assuming the assay with the lowest limit of detection is best . Data from at least one other study ( Riabaudo et al . , 2009 ) indicate that a level greater than 50 copies/ml may be more relevant . The difference between the Integrated and Total DNA is also interesting . Integrated DNA should be the most biologically relevant marker , based on the assumption that unintegrated HIV-1 DNA forms are thought not to contribute to rebound viraemia . However , the assay for Total HIV-1 DNA is much simpler and with tighter coefficients of variation , possibly due to the lack of a pre-amplification PCR stage . Another important factor impacting our data is that the median estimated time from seroconversion was 73 . 8 days , and so most of our patients would be starting therapy at Fiebig stage IV or later . It is possible that earlier identification of PHI and initiation of ART would have a greater impact on the reservoir and post-treatment control , and it is important that large studies are undertaken to determine this . In light of observational cohorts such as VISCONTI ( Saez-Cirion et al . , 2013 ) where treatment cessation revealed individuals who remain aviraemic post TI , there is increasing interest in undertaking closely monitored treatment interruption studies in which ART would be re-started based on a detectable plasma VL . These do not , however , have an encouraging history with previous studies set in the context of therapeutic vaccination or CD4 T cell restoration , resulting in rapid viraemic rebound and even harm ( Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy ( SMART ) Study Group et al . , 2006; Angel et al . , 2011; Garcia et al . , 2013 ) . Additionally , the recent report of viral rebound in the case of the Mississippi baby , means that greater understanding of mechanisms behind post-treatment control is needed . The potential , therefore , to develop an algorithm to combine various biomarkers to help predict individuals suitable for such studies is appealing . These data are evidence that such an algorithm may be possible , and that a marker as simple as HIV-1 DNA could be an important component . \n The design of the SPARTAC trial is reported elsewhere ( SPARTAC Trial Investigators et al . , 2013 ) . In brief , SPARTAC was an international open Randomised Controlled Trial enrolling adults with PHI within 6 months of a last negative , equivocal or incident HIV-1 test . All participants gave written informed consent . Research ethics committees in each country approved the trial . Time of seroconversion was estimated as the midpoint of last negative/equivocal and first positive tests , or date of incident test . Participants were randomised to receive ART for 48 weeks ( ART-48 ) , 12 weeks ( ART-12 ) or no therapy ( standard of care , SOC ) . The primary endpoint was a composite of two events: if participants either reached a CD4 count of <350 cells/mm3 ( >3 months after randomization and confirmed within 4 weeks ) or initiated long-term ART . This provided an immunological surrogate of clinical progression , but also allowed inclusion of those participants who commenced ART at CD4 cell counts greater than 350 cells/mm3 . Time to virological failure of participants randomized to ART-48 ( two analyses using both 50 and 400 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml as the cut-off [two consecutive readings] ) was a secondary endpoint . Participants for this sub-study of SPARTAC were those infected with subtype B HIV-1 and for whom adequate samples were available . For those in the analysis of progression and viral rebound at TI , we only selected participants who had viral load suppression ( <50 copies/ml; Chiron bDNA ) at point of stopping ART ( Table 1 and Supplementary file 1 ) . CD4 T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were sampled for HIV-1 DNA in all participants at baseline , regardless of trial arm . Participants randomised to the ART-48 arm were sampled at week 48 at the point of stopping ART and at a further 4 , 12 and 60 weeks post ART interruption ( 52 , 60 and 108 weeks post-ART initiation ) . Participants who were viraemic using the Chiron bDNA , ( Bayer , Leverkusen , Germany ) ( LLD 50 copies/ml ) at the point of TI were excluded . CD4 T cells were enriched from frozen PBMC samples by negative selection ( Dynabeads , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) to a purity of >97% . CD4 T cell DNA was extracted ( Qiagen , Venlo , Netherlands ) and used as input DNA for PCR . Cell copy number and total HIV-1 DNA levels were quantified both in triplicate using previously published assays ( Duncan et al . , 2013; Jones et al . , 2014 ) . Integrated HIV-1 was measured using an assay based on that previously published ( Liszewski et al . , 2009 ) but with some minor modifications . 40 repeated integration measurements per patient sample were performed along with five PCR reactions to which no Alu primer was added , to serve as a background control for determination of sample positivity . The first round master mix contained 1 . 5 U platinum taq per 50 \u00b5l reaction . The second round qPCR reaction was the same as the Total reaction described above , but with 10 \u00b5l of first round product being the input DNA . To quantify patient samples , one standard curve was generated by plotting the average cycle threshold ( Ct ) values for all integration signals at each Integration Standard ( IS ) dilution ( 70\u20130 . 2 copies of IS standard per well , diluted in 2 \u00b5g/ml PBMC DNA ) , so long as at least one integration signal was significantly different ( two standard deviations ) to the average gag-only background signal . The IS was a kind gift from Una O\u2019Doherty . Ln ( Copy number ) was plotted vs Ln ( average Ct ) and each point on the standard curve was repeated in duplicate . The standard curve fitted extremely well to a line of best fit ( r2 = 0 . 987 ) , which was then used to calculate copy numbers in patient samples . Each patient sample replicate was quantified individually using the standard curve to generate error . Plate to plate variation was assessed using quadruplicate replicates of 8e5 cells , which have one copy of HIV-1 per cell , diluted to 100 copies per well as a first round PCR DNA input . The average coefficient of variance was 8 . 31% . HIV-1 DNA ( Total and Integrated ) distributed normally following log10 transformation . The association between Total and Integrated HIV-1 DNA levels was tested using Pearson correlations . Linear regression was used to examine the association between continuous clinical baseline covariates and HIV-1 DNA . Tests between grouped variables and DNA levels were tested with Mann\u2013Whitney , Kruskal\u2013Wallis and t tests where appropriate . For the association between baseline DNA and the SPARTAC primary endpoint , Kaplan\u2013Meier plots and univariable Cox models were constructed , and subsequently adjusted for baseline covariates . Where participants received ART , the time to primary endpoint was calculated from the time of TI . Association with time to rebound was also assessed using Kaplan\u2013Meier plots and Cox models . All statistics were calculated using R version 3 . 1 . 0 . Plots were drawn using Prism version 5 . 0 ."}

In the vast majority of cases , the drugs work as intended . But a minority of patients take longer than expected to regain consciousness after anesthetic , and a few wake up during the surgery itself . It is unclear what causes these unintended events . When choosing an anesthetic dose for each patient , physicians rely on data from large clinical studies . These studies expose many patients to different doses of an anesthetic drug . At higher doses , fewer and fewer patients remain conscious . This enables physicians to identify the dose at which an average person will lose consciousness . But this approach ignores the difference between the response of an individual and that of the population as a whole . At the population level , the likelihood of a patient being awake decreases smoothly as the concentration of anesthetic increases . But within that population , each individual patient can only ever show a binary response: awake or not awake . To compare anesthetic effects on individuals versus populations , McKinstry-Wu , Wasilczuk et al . exposed mice to a commonly used anesthetic called isoflurane . During prolonged exposure to a constant dose of the drug , each mouse was sometimes unconscious and sometimes awake . These fluctuations in responsiveness seemed to occur at random . Exposing zebrafish to propofol , an anesthetic that works via a different mechanism , had a similar effect . Notably , the responses of both species to anesthesia showed a phenomenon known as inertia . If an individual was unresponsive at one point in time , they were likely to still be unresponsive when assessed again after three minutes . The amount of inertia was similar in mice and zebrafish . This suggests that the mechanism responsible for inertia has remained unchanged over more than 400 million years of evolution . The results reveal similarities between how individuals respond to anesthetics and how individual anesthetic molecules act on cells . When a molecule binds to its receptor protein on a cell , the receptor fluctuates spontaneously between active and inactive states . Studying how individuals respond to drugs could thus provide clues to how the drugs themselves work . Future studies should explore the biological basis of fluctuations in anesthetic responses . Understanding how these arise will help us tailor anesthetics to individual patients .", "source": "Traditionally , drug dosing is based on a concentration-response relationship estimated in a population . Yet , in specific individuals , decisions based on the population-level effects frequently result in over or under-dosing . Here , we interrogate the relationship between population-based and individual-based responses to anesthetics in mice and zebrafish . The anesthetic state was assessed by quantifying responses to simple stimuli . Individual responses dynamically fluctuated at a fixed drug concentration . These fluctuations exhibited resistance to state transitions . Drug sensitivity varied dramatically across individuals in both species . The amount of noise driving transitions between states , in contrast , was highly conserved in vertebrates separated by 400 million years of evolution . Individual differences in anesthetic sensitivity and stochastic fluctuations in responsiveness complicate the ability to appropriately dose anesthetics to each individual . Identifying the biological substrate of noise , however , may spur novel therapies , assure consistent drug responses , and encourage the shift from population-based to personalized medicine . \n One of the great promises of personalized medicine is the delivery of a maximally efficacious and minimally harmful dose of appropriate medication to every patient ( Fitzgerald et al . , 2006 ) . Traditionally , dosing decisions are based on the relationship between drug concentration and the magnitude of effect observed in a population expressed as the sigmoidal dose-response curve ( Goodman , 1996 ) . An implicit assumption of this approach is that population averages adequately reflect the processes operating within each individual patient . This is not always true . For many drug classes such as antiepileptics , anesthetics , and antiarrhythmics , the response is binary at the level of an individual\u2014the desired effect is either present or not ( L\u00f6scher , 2011; Sunderam et al . , 2001; J\u00fcrgens et al . , 2003; Sonner , 2002 ) . The population-based dose-response curve , in contrast , is a smooth graded function of drug concentration . Therefore , in order to deliver on the promise of optimal drug dosing at the individual level , the relationship between individual binary responses and the population-based graded estimates of drug potency have to be more rigorously defined ( Koch-Weser , 1975 ) . Many examples of graded population-level responses co-existing with discrete , binary individual responses are seen in biophysics . A\u00a0priori , one might have expected that the current flow through a single ion channel molecule would simply be a scaled version of the current recorded in a cell containing many such ion channels . Yet , this is not the case ( Sakmann and Neher , 1984 ) . While at the whole cell level , current varies smoothly as a function of voltage and time ( Hodgkin and Huxley , 1952 ) , each ion channel molecule stochastically switches between conductive and nonconductive states ( Fukushima , 1982; Hoshi et al . , 1990; Aldrich et al . , 1983 ) . Ligand-gated ion channels also stochastically fluctuate between discrete conductive and non-conductive states at a constant concentration of a ligand ( Brickley et al . , 1999; Swanson et al . , 1996; Papke et al . , 1989 ) . Stochastic transitions between discrete states extend to higher levels of organization . For example , synaptic transmission is mediated by stochastic vesicular fusion events ( del Castillo and Katz , 1954; Kuffler and Yoshikami , 1975; Rizzoli and Betz , 2005 ) . At the cellular level , stochastic fluctuations in gene expression and protein abundance are observed even in a clonal population of cells ( Elowitz et al . , 2002; McAdams and Arkin , 1997; Newman et al . , 2006; Raser and O'Shea , 2004 ) . For instance , stochastic forces influence differentiation patterns across identical cells and give rise to drastically different proteomic responses of clonal cancer cells to drugs ( Cohen et al . , 2008; Losick and Desplan , 2008 ) . Thus , stochastic fluctuations among discrete states even in a constant environment are the rule at the microscopic level in many , if not all , biological processes . Detailed quantitative models of stochastic switching between different states of an individual molecule ( Hille , 2001; Colquhoun and Hawkes , 1995 ) are required to forge the relationship between discrete microscopic events and graded responses in the population . Macroscopic constructs such as pharmacologic efficacy depend upon drug-induced changes in discrete states of single molecules as well as stochastic switches among them . Yet , drug efficacy does not uniquely specify responses of individual molecules ( Colquhoun , 1998 ) . Thus , while discrete responses at the individual level can be linked to the smooth population-level responses using techniques from statistical mechanics , individual responses cannot be readily inferred from population-level analyses . Here , we asked whether stochastic fluctuations among discrete states , similar to those postulated to act at the level of individual molecules , organelles , and cells influence the responses of intact multicellular organisms exposed to a constant drug concentration . For this purpose , we chose to focus on anesthetics . Anesthesia is thought to consist of four basic components: amnesia , immobility , analgesia , and unconsciousness . Responses to stimuli are typically used to quantify the various components of anesthesia . At lower anesthetic doses that produce light sedation , a patient can respond to salient verbal commands and less noticeable auditory commands ( Wong et al . , 2014 ) , albeit with longer latency . When the state of general anesthesia is attained , the patient is unresponsive even to a painful surgical stimulus ( Miller , 2014 ) . Clinical assessment of anesthetic depth ultimately collapses to binary outcomes: amnestic or not , immobile or not , and conscious or not . We consequently studied binary responses to a simple stimulus at a fixed anesthetic concentration across individuals to determine whether they are anesthetized or not . These all-or-none responses can be assessed by determining whether a human patient reacts to a simple verbal command ( Sanders et al . , 2017; Russell , 2013; Flaishon et al . , 1997 ) . The concentration of anesthetic at which 50% of patient lose their ability to respond to verbal commands is known at MAC-awake ( Franks , 2008 ) . In rodent literature , the righting reflex ( RR ) is typically used to establish whether a mouse is awake or not ( Figure 1A ) ( Wasilczuk et al . , 2018; Franks , 2006 ) . MAC-awake and the EC50 for loss of RR are closely correlated across mechanistically distinct anesthetics ( Franks , 2008 ) . Discrete responses to simple stimuli can be used in other organisms such as larval zebrafish to assess anesthetic potency ( Yang et al . , 2018 ) . In contrast to discrete measures used in individual subjects , anesthetic potency at a population level is expressed as a smooth sigmoid function ( Miller , 2014 ) . Traditionally , the dichotomy between the graded population-level response on the one hand , and the binary responses of individuals on the other , has been interpreted as inter-subject variability ( Sonner et al . , 2000 ) . For instance , at the population level half maximal effective concentration ( EC50 ) , it is assumed that half of all the subjects will be able to consistently respond to the stimulus while the other half will consistently fail to do so ( Figure 1B ) . Yet , this is not the only possibility . It is possible that at EC50 , each individual subject will respond to 50% of stimuli ( Figure 1C ) . Finally , it is possible that the probability of response is influenced by the state of the subject at the moment when the stimulus is applied ( Figure 1D ) . To distinguish among these possibilities , we exposed both mice and zebrafish to fixed concentrations of two mechanistically distinct anesthetics and repeatedly tested their responsiveness . The results unequivocally demonstrate that at a fixed drug concentration , each individual mouse or zebrafish stochastically switches between being responsive and unresponsive . The probability of response depends upon the subject\u2019s state . Therefore , stochastic state switching is apparently present at all organizational levels , from receptor to cell to whole animal . Unlike identical ion channel molecules , however , individual animals both in highly genetically inbred and across outbred populations exhibited dramatic variability in parameters that describe the stochastic switching between the responsive and unresponsive states . The inter-individual variability in parameters of the stochastic model fit to each individual was highly structured in both mice and in zebrafish . One manifestation of this structure is that while the overall sensitivity to anesthetics varied among individuals , the amount of noise that drives state switches was the same across individuals exposed to the same anesthetic concentration . As a result of the inter-subject variability and stochastic intra-subject fluctuations in responsiveness , the population-level concentration response cannot be used to reliably determine the probability that any given individual will ( or will not ) be anesthetized . Detailed quantification of stochastic forces that shape the within-subject fluctuations in responsiveness and between-subject variability lays the foundation for the construction of more informative stochastic models that can reconcile binary responses of individual organisms with population-based measures of drug potency . These models can in turn be used to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine to deliver the appropriate dose of medication tailored to each individual patient . \n The presence of the righting reflex ( RR ) during continuous isoflurane administration was used as the measure of responsiveness in mice . After 2 hr of equilibration at 0 . 6% isoflurane , the probability of an intact RR was 44 \u00b1 6% ( mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD across trials ) . This did not correspond to 44% of mice being consistently responsive and the rest being consistently unresponsive , as is commonly assumed . Instead , in every mouse , the outcome of the RR test fluctuated over time at a fixed anesthetic concentration ( Figure 2A ) while the population response probability at 0 . 6% isoflurane remained stable over time ( Figure 2B ) . Individual fluctuations in RR at concentrations deviating from EC50 were less frequent , but nevertheless were reliably observed at concentrations below 0 . 9% ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . In an analogous experiment using a mechanistically distinct anesthetic , propofol , we determined the responsiveness in larval zebrafish using the startle reflex ( SR ) triggered by mechanical stimulation . Individual larval zebrafish demonstrated fluctuating responses to identical tap stimuli ( Figure 2C ) . Zebrafish exposed to no propofol had a significantly higher response probability to the tap stimulus ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A , U\u00a0=\u00a055 , nE3 = n3\u00b5M=360 trials , p<0 . 0001 ) . Drug concentration remained constant in the propofol exposures ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . The response probability across the population remained constant ( 45 \u00b1 5% mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD across trials ) for three hours after an initial hour of equilibration in 3 \u03bcM propofol ( Figure 2D ) . Effective concentration , defined as the concentration of the drug required to produce an effect of a given intensity , is a universally used population-based measure of drug potency ( Goodman , 1996 ) . We sought to apply this measure to each individual . At the individual level , effective concentration is equivalent to the average across-trial probability of observing a response to a stimulus at a given drug concentration . Therefore , we compared the experimental results in Figure 2A and C to simulations of a Bernoulli process ( Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) constructed such that the probability of positive RR ( or SR ) was identical on each trial and the same as that observed experimentally for a population ( Figure 3A ) . In mice for instance , this simulation was constructed such that the probability of responding to a stimulus is 44% on every trial . As expected , both simulations ( Figure 3A ) and the experimental results ( Figure 3B ) have a similar overall response probability ( 45 \u00b1 3% and 44 \u00b1 6% mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD for simulations and mouse experiments , respectively ) . The median response probability in simulations was not statistically different from experimental observations in both mice ( Figure 3C , U\u00a0=\u00a0197 . 5 , nsim\u00a0=\u00a0nexp\u00a0=\u00a020 , p=0 . 95 ) and in zebrafish ( Figure 3D , U\u00a0=\u00a02276 , nsim\u00a0=\u00a0nexp\u00a0=\u00a072 , p=0 . 34 ) . Note , however , that the experimentally observed switches between positive and negative RR occur less frequently than in the simulation ( Figure 3E , U\u00a0=\u00a048 . 5 , nsim\u00a0=\u00a0nexp\u00a0=\u00a020 , p<0 . 0001 ) . This was also true of zebrafish ( Figure 3F , U\u00a0=\u00a0300 . 5 , nsim\u00a0=\u00a0nexp\u00a0=\u00a072 p<0 . 0001 ) . To further quantify this resistance to state transitions , we compared the probability of becoming unresponsive after responding to a stimulus on a previous trial , P ( U|R ) ( Figure 3B , red arrow ) , to the probability of failing to respond on two consecutive trials , P ( U|U ) ( Figure 3B , purple arrow ) . In both mice ( Figure 3G , U\u00a0=\u00a0103 , nP ( U|R ) = nP ( U|U ) =20 , p<0 . 001 ) and zebrafish ( Figure 3H , U\u00a0=\u00a0501 , nP ( U|R ) = nP ( U|U ) =72 , p<0 . 0001 ) , the probability of being unresponsive on the next trial was significantly higher if the animal was found to be unresponsive on the preceding trial . Hence , fluctuations in responsiveness under constant anesthetic concentration are inconsistent with a Bernoulli process . Therefore , while effective concentration is a useful measure of population-based drug potency , it cannot be adequately applied to an individual . Specifically , effective concentration cannot account for the apparent resistance to state transitions . We now turn to the relationship between trial-to-trial fluctuations and population level variability . One common assumption is that observing a single mouse over long period of time is equivalent to observing a snapshot of the population of mice . In other words , an experiment on each individual mouse can be thought of as a different realization of the same process . In an apparent departure from this assumption , we observed high inter-individual variability in responsiveness in mice and in zebrafish . For instance , at 0 . 6% isoflurane some mice were able to right themselves on fewer than 20% of trials , while other mice within the same highly inbred population , exposed to the same anesthetic concentration , during the same experiment , were able to right themselves on\u00a0~70% of trials ( Figure 3C ) . Experimentally observed inter-individual variability was significantly higher than in simulations constrained to have the same number of trials ( Figure 3C , F ( 1 , 38 ) =27 . 8 , p<0 . 0001 for mice , Figure 3D , F ( 1 , 142 ) =52 . 5 , p<0 . 0001 for zebrafish , Brown-Forsythe test ) . This implies that the observed inter-subject variability in responsiveness is unlikely to be solely due to finite sample size . Rather , anesthetic sensitivity can differ significantly between individuals . We then sought to determine how inter-individual variability is reflected in the parameters of a model of trial-to-trial fluctuations in responsiveness fit to each animal individually ( Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . The dwell times in responsive and unresponsive states for both mice ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) and zebrafish ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ) were approximately exponential . No significant autocorrelations in fluctuations were observed ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C , D ) . Thus , switching between states of responsiveness and unresponsiveness in each individual can be well approximated by a two-state transition probability matrix ( Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Because the sum of transition probabilities in each row of this matrix is exactly one , the two-state transition probability matrix is completely specified by knowing the two transition probabilities along the diagonal , P ( U|U ) and P ( R|R ) . The plane spanned by these two diagonal transition probabilities , therefore , is the parameter space for models of stochastic fluctuations in responsiveness in mice and in zebrafish ( Figure 4A ) . Movement along the x-axis to the right , results in decrease in the overall probability of response ( e . g . from I to II and from III to IV , Figure 4A ) . Conversely , movement up along the y-axis results in the increase in the overall probability of response ( e . g . from III to I and from IV to II , Figure 4A ) . Moving along the dotted lines within the parameter space does not affect the overall probability of being responsive \u2013 that\u00a0is systems II and III have the same overall probability of response . The key difference between II and III is the number of transitions between the responsive and the unresponsive state . In contrast , movement from I to IV does not affect the sum of P ( U|U ) and P ( R|R ) . As a result , while the overall probability of responsiveness in I and IV is different , the amount of noise that drives state transitions between the responsive and the unresponsive states is the same . To realize why this is the case , we can visualize the two-by-two transition probability matrix as an energy landscape with two wells which correspond to the responsive and the unresponsive states ( Proekt and Hudson , 2018 ) . Conservation of the sum of\u00a0P ( U|U ) and P ( R|R ) reflects the fact that the sum of the depths of the wells is conserved . To characterize inter-individual variability , we estimated transition probability matrices for each animal individually . This yields a single estimate of P ( U|U ) and P ( R|R ) for each individual . The simplest model of inter-individual variability is that the transition probability matrix , M , for each individual is a random sample taken independently from the distribution of P ( U|U ) and P ( R|R ) . This null hypothesis corresponds to a cloud of points in Figure 4B . Yet , in stark departure from this prediction , the observed joint distribution of transition probabilities in individual mice lies on a diagonal ( Figure 4C ) . Therefore , P ( U|U ) and P ( R|R ) are strongly negatively correlated among individuals ( R2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120 . 85 , p<0 . 0001 , Pearson\u2019s R ) . The same relationship was observed in larval zebrafish ( Figure 4E , R2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120 . 77 , p<0 . 0001 , Pearson\u2019s R ) . A similar strong negative correlation is observed when comparing decay rates of the responsive and unresponsive states estimated from individual dwell time distributions fit to single exponential decay functions ( dwell times from Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A , B , R2mouse\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120 . 64 , p=0 . 002 , Pearson\u2019s R , R2zebrafish\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120 . 71 , p<0 . 0001 , Pearson\u2019s R ) . Note that P ( U|U ) and P ( R|R ) quantify the propensity of the system to stay in its previously observed state . The fact that their sum is constant across individuals implies that the amount of noise that drives state transitions between responsive and unresponsive states was consistent in all individuals exposed to a fixed anesthetic concentration . Yet , sensitivity to anesthetics measured as the overall probability of responding to a stimulus varied broadly in the same population of individuals . Altogether these results indicate that , while transitions between states of responsiveness are noise-driven and therefore unpredictable , the amount of noise is tightly controlled in all individuals . Too little noise would result in individuals being trapped in a single state , whereas too much noise would overpower the intrinsic dynamics of the brain , leading to a noise dominated process characterized by rapid state switching . Sigmoid dose-response curves are one-to-one functions\u2014knowing drug concentration is sufficient to estimate probability of a response in a population . Critically , the converse is also true; knowing the probability of a response in a population is sufficient to determine the concentration of the drug to which this population is exposed . While this one-to-one relationship may hold for a population , we sought to determine whether the large inter-individual variability ( Figures 4\u20135 ) complicates this one-to-one relationship at the level of an individual . We compared individual transition probability matrices estimated at 0 . 6% and 0 . 3% isoflurane . Note that here , mice exposed to 0 . 6% isoflurane were distinct from mice exposed to 0 . 3% isoflurane . Individual matrices estimated for 0 . 3% isoflurane , much like those estimated at 0 . 6% isoflurane , exhibited strong negative correlations ( R2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120 . 86 , p<0 . 0001 , Pearson\u2019s R ) between the diagonal elements of the transition probability matrices ( Figure 6A ) . At the level of the population , there were statistically significant differences between righting probability observed at the two anesthetic concentrations ( Figure 6B , U\u00a0=\u00a054 , n0 . 3% iso\u00a0=\u00a018 , n0 . 6% iso\u00a0=\u00a020 , p<0 . 001 ) . Note , however , that there is significant overlap ( 57% ) between the two distributions . As a consequence of this overlap , it is not possible to reliably determine whether an individual was exposed to 0 . 6% or 0 . 3% isoflurane over a large range of individual anesthetic sensitivities ( Figure 6C ) . The same phenomenon was observed for individual zebrafish exposed to medium alone or 3 \u03bcM propofol ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This observation is in stark contrast to the population-based measures of anesthetic potency . Hill slopes of the population-based dose-response curves for anesthetics are some of the steepest among clinically useful drugs ( Friedman et al . , 2010; Joiner et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , small increases in drug concentration are expected to result in a dramatic change in the probability that an individual will be anesthetized . Yet , as demonstrated here , there is considerable overlap in sensitivity to anesthetics . This illustrates the fundamental inconsistency between population-based and individual-based measures of drug potency . Because results in Figure 6 were obtained in two separate cohorts of mice each exposed to a single anesthetic concentration , we sought to determine whether it is possible to reliably infer drug concentration from behavioral responses for the same individual exposed to two drug concentrations . To address this , we exposed a separate cohort of 20 mice on eight occasions , four times each to 0 . 4% and 0 . 7% isoflurane . Strong negative correlations between P ( U|U ) and P ( R|R ) existed at both 0 . 4% isoflurane ( R2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120 . 69 , p<0 . 0001 , Pearson\u2019s R ) and 0 . 7% isoflurane ( R2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120 . 79 , p<0 . 0001 , Pearson\u2019s R ) . Population-level response probability at 0 . 4% and 0 . 7% isoflurane differed significantly ( Figure 7A , U\u00a0=\u00a07 , n0 . 4% iso\u00a0=\u00a0n0 . 7% iso\u00a0=\u00a020 , p<0 . 0001 ) . Overlap of response probabilities at the population level between different isoflurane concentrations did exist ( 18% ) , but was approximately three times smaller than that observed across separate mouse cohorts exposed to 0 . 3% and 0 . 6% isoflurane ( Figure 6A ) . Overlap at the individual level varied widely , from close to zero to nearly complete ( Figure 7B , C , Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Thus , observing the same individual exposed to different drug concentrations , improves the reliability of distinguishing between drug concentrations on the basis of righting probability . Comparing different , albeit highly genetically similar individuals , exposed to different isoflurane concentrations increases the response variability and therefore decreases the reliability of classification . In Figures 4 and 6 , we observe a strong negative correlation between the two conditional probabilities that express the tendency of staying in the previously observed state ( P ( U|U ) and P ( R|R ) ) . To investigate the origins of this observation , we constructed a simple mathematical model that can explain this striking correlation . The Markov process defined by a two-state transition probability matrix can be thought of as a discrete approximation of a continuous system that fluctuates stochastically between two stable states . To illustrate how such a multistable system can be embodied in the brain , we consider a simple network consisting of two neuronal populations ( \u03b1 and \u03b2 Figure 8A ) . The two neuronal populations inhibit each other and excite themselves . Moreno-Bote et al . ( 2007 ) demonstrate that activity of such networks can be parameterized as a function of difference in activity of the two neuronal populations ( Figure 8B ) . Because of self-excitation and mutual inhibition , the network exhibits two stable activity patterns: one where activity of \u03b1 dominates , and the other , where activity of \u03b2 dominates . We operationally define these stable network patterns as awake and anesthetized respectively . The likelihood of every activity pattern of the network is expressed by an \u2018energy function\u2019 ( Figure 8B ) . The more likely activity patterns are associated with lower energy and the less likely activity patterns are associated with higher energy . In the absence of noise such networks stay in one of the two stable states indefinitely . When noise is added to the system , it switches between the two stable network configurations stochastically . While the amount of noise changes the frequency of switching between the two states ( Figure 8C ) , it does not have a dramatic effect on the shape of the overall distribution of states . In both cases the distribution of states of the system is bimodal akin to what we observe in the startle reflex data in the zebrafish ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . To model the effects of anesthetics on different individuals , we assume that anesthetics activate sleep-active \u03b2 neurons and inhibit wake-active \u03b1 neurons . To account for the strong negative correlation between P ( U|U ) and P ( R|R ) , we assume that the degree of anesthetic-induced excitation and inhibition is correlated . Thus , individual differences in anesthetic sensitivity can be modeled by modulating the anesthetic effect on the network . In an attempt to model the results in Figures 4 and 6 , we simulate the behavior of such networks with various amounts of noise . We then approximate the data of the kind seen in Figure 8C obtained for different anesthetic sensitivities and noise levels using a Markov model akin to that deployed for analysis of righting and startle reflex throughout this work . To accomplish this , the continuous fluctuations in the state of the network are binarized using a threshold ( Figure 8C ) into the \u2018responsive\u2019 and the \u2018unresponsive\u2019 states . The transition probability matrix is then estimated from these binary time-series . The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 8D . When the noise amounts are small , the system tends to stay in its previously observed state . Thus , for low-noise simulations , the points are found around the periphery of the plane spanned by P ( U|U ) and P ( R|R ) . When the noise is exceedingly high , the dynamics of the system become independent of the shape of the energy landscape and tends toward the point ( 0 . 5 , 0 . 5 ) in the plot in Figure 8C . This would be expected if the system behaved like a Bernoulli process at EC50 . In order to reproduce the results in Figures 4 and 6 , the amount of noise needs to be tuned and maintained at an approximately the same level across individuals . In the simulations , this corresponds to Gaussian noise with mean 0 and standard deviation ( \u03c3 ) =0 . 4 . These simulations support our conjecture that while individuals are different in terms of anesthetic sensitivity , the amount of noise that drives fluctuations between the responsive and the unresponsive states is conserved . Note , that in the units of trial number , the dwell time distributions were similar in fish and in mice . However , in mice the trials were spaced 3 minutes apart whereas in fish the inter-trial interval was 30 seconds . Thus , in units of seconds , mice dwelled signficantly longer in the awake and the unresponsive state than zebrafish . In order to account for this difference in the characteristic dwell times , the time scale of fluctuations shown in Figure 8C would have to be scaled by a specie-specific diffusion constant ( Methods ) . \n Here , we demonstrate that even when an animal is exposed to a fixed drug concentration , its response fluctuates stochastically . The probability of response depends on the state of the animal at the moment of stimulation . Specifically , the fluctuations exhibit inertia \u2013 the animal is more likely to be stuck in its current state than to transition between states of responsiveness . In contrast to most drugs that are administered either intravenously or orally , the route of administration of many anesthetics is inhalational . This allows us to assure that the drug concentration in the animal is at equilibrium with the ambient concentration in a closed chamber ( Friedman et al . , 2010 ) . We utilize this significant experimental advantage to focus on the dynamics of responses within each individual at a constant drug concentration . However , stochastic fluctuations are not unique to a volatile anesthetic . An intravenous anesthetic , propofol , administered to zebrafish equilibrated with a fixed concentration bath , was also associated with dynamic fluctuations in responsiveness . The stochastic processes that govern the fluctuations observed under two mechanistically distinct anesthetics were remarkably similar between mice and zebrafish . It is curious to note that while the dwell times in the responsive and the unresponsive state in mice and in zebrafish were similarly correlated , the absolute duration of these states varied signficantly between mice and zebrafish . The duration of responsive and unresponsive states was approximately similar to the duration of sleep episodes in these two species ( Zhang et al . , 2007; Yokogawa et al . , 2007 ) . It is possible that this relationship between duration of sleep episodes and the duration of the episodes of unresponsiveness arises because similar neurobiological mechanisms are responsible for both transitions between sleep and wakefulness and fluctuations between the responsive and the unresponsive states observed under anesthesia . Our observations of stochastic switching between responsive and unresponsive states are consistent with previous findings showing that at a fixed anesthetic concentration , spectral characteristics of electrical activity within thalamocortical networks switch stochastically between several discrete activity patterns ( Hudson et al . , 2014; Clement et al . , 2008 ) . Similar observations have been made using electroencephalography ( EEG ) of patients under anesthesia ( Chander et al . , 2014; Li et al . , 2019; Vlisides et al . , 2019 ) . Our findings in this study suggest that such stochastic fluctuations have a behavioral counterpart expressed as fluctuating ability to respond to a stimulus . It has been suggested previously that anesthetics stabilize neuronal dynamics in humans ( Alonso et al . , 2014; Tagliazucchi et al . , 2016 ) and in non-human primates ( Solovey et al . , 2015; Alonso et al . , 2019 ) . Stabilization of neuronal dynamics may contribute to the behavioral inertia observed in fluctuations in responsiveness of both mice and zebrafish . This resistance to state transitions may contribute ( Proekt and Hudson , 2018 ) to anesthetic hysteresis ( Friedman et al . , 2010; Joiner et al . , 2013; Kuizenga et al . , 2018; Warnaby et al . , 2017 ) \u2013 a left-shift in a dose-response curve for emergence relative to induction of anesthesia that has been observed across taxa from Drosophila to humans . Stochastic responses at a fixed drug concentration help explain several otherwise puzzling phenomena in clinical anesthesiology . On the one hand , Hill slopes of dose-response curves for anesthetics are reported between 10\u00a0and\u00a040 ( Miller , 2014 ) ; some of the steepest of the clinically used drugs . This is traditionally interpreted as a sign of low inter-subject variability in responsiveness . Nonetheless , approximately ten percent of patients transiently wake up during surgery as measured by their ability to respond to a verbal command ( Sanders et al . , 2017; Russell , 2013; Gaskell et al . , 2017 ) . Luckily , incidence of awareness accompanied by post-operative recall is much less frequent ( Avidan et al . , 2008 ) . However , even episodes of awareness associated with recall and high risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder ( Osterman et al . , 2001 ) are not reliably detected by the existing EEG-based monitors of anesthetic state ( Avidan et al . , 2011 ) . While anesthetics are thought to impart dose-dependent effects on neuronal activity ( Stanski et al . , 1984; Katoh et al . , 1998 ) , only weak correlations are observed between EEG characteristics and anesthetic concentration ( Whitlock et al . , 2011 ) . Indeed , both inter-individual differences ( Whitlock et al . , 2011 ) and fluctuations of EEG measures of depth of anesthesia at a constant drug concentration ( Bloom et al . , 2005 ) obscure the relationship between drug concentration and the observed state of the EEG . It is likely that the traditional population-based approach of estimating the relationship between the concentration of the drug and the response dramatically under-represents the within and inter-subject variability . Indeed , under most circumstances , each animal is tested only once at each drug concentration . The repeated testing of each animal under a fixed drug concentration is more akin to the clinical scenario where the patient is exposed to many surgical stimuli that can elicit stochastic fluctuations in the level of consciousness . The Hill slope value observed in our study was approximately an order of magnitude lower than the previously published data ( Friedman et al . , 2010; Joiner et al . , 2013 ) . This relative decrease in Hill slope reflects high inter-individual variability and stochastic fluctuations in each individual . There are several significant differences between our experimental paradigm and those explored in the previous work . Previous work , guided by purely pharmacokinetic considerations , used shorter isoflurane exposures . In contrast , here we measured anesthetic responsiveness after a two-hour equilibration time . Under most circumstances , Markov processes lead to a single equilibrium distribution of states ( Roman , 1989 ) . The time it takes to reach this equilibrium , however , is dictated by , among other things , the degree of resistance to state transitions . Thus , one reason for the discrepancy between our Hill slope estimate and that published previously is that our analysis assures that the population of animals is at a behavioral steady state . In order to reliably anesthetize an individual after a short exposure , higher concentrations of anesthetics are necessary . Indeed , our EC50 estimate ( 0 . 54\u20130 . 55% isoflurane ) is significantly lower than that published in the previous work ( 0 . 9% for induction and 0 . 83% for emergence ) ( Friedman et al . , 2010 ) . Another fundamental difference between our approach and that used in the previous work is that we tested mice repeatedly . In contrast , in the previous work , mice are typically tested only once at each concentration . Repeated testing revealed trial-to-trial fluctuations . These fluctuations increase the apparent variability in responsiveness , thereby decreasing the apparent Hill slope of the population . The detailed mechanism of these stochastic fluctuations is not known as anesthetics exert effects on many molecular targets distributed broadly throughout the brain and spinal cord . A number of lines of evidence converge on the fact that anesthetics at least in part hijack the sleep-wake circuitry by exciting sleep-promoting and inhibiting wake-promoting neurons ( Zhang et al . , 2015; Moore et al . , 2012; Vazey and Aston-Jones , 2014; Nelson et al . , 2002 ) . Switching between sleep and wake is thought to be mediated by the reciprocal inhibition between these neuronal populations . Networks consisting of reciprocally inhibitory neuronal populations tend to exhibit self-reinforcing behavior . Once sleep-active neurons activate beyond a certain threshold , they shut down the wake-active neurons thereby decreasing their inhibitory effects and further strengthen mutual excitation amongst the sleep-active neurons ( Saper et al . , 2005 ) . The converse happens during wakefulness . In the absence of perturbations , the network consisting of such mutually inhibitory self-reinforcing neuronal populations will remain in the same state indefinitely . Once sufficient noise is added , however , the system will stochastically switch between consolidated states of sleep and wakefulness . Theoretical investigations of bistable neuronal networks suggest that activity within such mutually inhibitory neuronal populations can be well approximated by a diffusion on an energy landscape with two potential wells; one for each stable activity pattern ( Moreno-Bote et al . , 2007 ) . Anesthetics can therefore be thought of as stabilizing ( deepening ) the wells associated with unresponsiveness and de-stabilizing the wells associated with wakefulness . The degree to which these states are stabilized by clinically relevant doses of anesthetics is apparently insufficient to consistently keep all animals in the anesthetized state . Hence , stochastic fluctuations may be responsible for episodes of awareness that occur during surgeries . The importance of noise in systems near a bifurcation between two stable behaviors is not limited to circuits that control sleep and wakefulness ( Chialvo , 2010; Destexhe and Contreras , 2006 ) . Neuronal architectures similar to those involved in sleep and wakefulness are thought to play a role in diverse processes such as sensory perception ( Moreno-Bote et al . , 2007 ) , decision making ( Wong and Wang , 2006 ) , seizure generation ( Suffczynski et al . , 2004; Fr\u00f6hlich et al . , 2010 ) , and working memory ( Camperi and Wang , 1998 ) to name a few . Mathematically similar phenomena govern transitions between normal sinus rhythm and arrhythmias ( Kim et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , it is likely that stochastic fluctuations between distinct responses observed under constant drug concentration are not unique to anesthetics . To determine whether a bistable system with noise can explain the striking correlations between P ( U|U ) and P ( R|R ) observed herein , we simulated such a neural-network-inspired system with parametrically varied amount of noise . The results of this simulation show that in order to obtain such correlations , the amount of noise must be conserved among individuals . Another issue addressed by the modeling approach is the binary nature of behavioral responses in each individual . In zebrafish , this binarization was motivated by the observation of a bimodal distribution of distances travelled by each zebrafish after the tap stimulus . This bimodality naturally suggests that the responses fall into two distinct classes . Yet , similar measurements are much more difficult to perform for the righting reflex . Thus , it is not clear from behavioral observations of RR alone , whether the underlying processes that give rise to a response on a RR trial are continuous or discrete . Furthermore , even if the underlying processes are discrete it is not a\u00a0priori clear that only two states are present . We observed that dwell times in both the responsive and the unresponsive state are well-approximated by a single exponential distribution . Thus , we only find empirical evidence for two states . Longer recordings may be required in future work to determine whether other states are needed to completely describe the data . The two state Markov model used to analyze behavioral responses , can be seen as a natural discretization of the continuous bistable system exemplified by our modeling approach . For most reasonable choices of threshold , the continuous system and its discrete approximation will yield similar results . In some ways , our observations of stochastic switching between different states at a fixed drug concentration are similar to those well known for single receptor molecules ( Hoshi et al . , 1990; Papke et al . , 1989; Hille , 2001; Colquhoun and Hawkes , 1995; Tank et al . , 1982 ) . There is an important distinction , however , between molecular scale state transitions and those observed at the behavioral level in animals . At the molecular scale , differences between receptors are largely immaterial\u2014the same stochastic model can be used to describe state transitions in all receptors of a particular kind . Thus , observing a single receptor molecule over time is sufficient to determine the response of a population of such receptors . Within intact multicellular organisms , in contrast , we show that the transition probabilities were significantly different amongst highly genetically similar ( Uchimura et al . , 2015 ) and genetically outbred individuals exposed to the same anesthetic concentration . Observation of one individual on many trials does not equate to observing a population of individuals . Indeed , at population level EC50 , some animals were three times as likely to be responsive as other individuals from the same population . Furthermore , these individual differences were consistent across time in each individual . The inter-individual variability in the transition probabilities that govern switching between responsive and unresponsive states was constrained such that the sum of the diagonal elements was a constant . This constraint is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates from zebrafish to mice . Note that the sum of the diagonal elements in a square matrix is known as the trace and is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues . The largest eigenvalue of a transition probability matrix for a reversible Markov process is 1 ( Levin and Peres , 2017 ) . The fact that the trace is approximately the same in all individuals under similar experimental conditions implies that the spectral gap of the 2 \u00d7 2 transition probability matrix defined as , \u03bb1\u2212\u03bb2 , where \u03bbn is the nth eigenvalue is also a constant conserved among individuals . The spectral gap of the matrix sets its mixing time , or the time it takes for a system starting out in a random distribution of states to approach its equilibrium distribution . In this particular case , the equilibrium distribution is the overall probability that a given animal will be able to respond to a stimulus . Boltzmann equation asserts that diffusive systems of the kind used in our model come to a single equilibrium distribution that depends just on the energy function . The time it takes to reach this equilibrium distribution of states , however , depends on the amount of noise . The more noise is added to the system , the quicker it reaches the equilibrium distribution . Thus , there is a fundamental relationship between the conservation of the spectral gap across individuals and the tightly controlled noise in a continuous system characterized by a two well potential . In a clear departure from the predictions made by the population-level dose-response curve , our findings indicate that the equilibrium probability of responding to a stimulus at a given drug concentration is different for distinct individuals . The time it takes to reach this behavioral equilibrium , however , is conserved amongst animals . This strongly implies that the noise which drives state transitions between responsive and unresponsive states is tightly biologically controlled . A similar observation has been made for stochastic influences on gene expression ( Elowitz et al . , 2002 ) . On the one hand , our results may be seen as disappointing for the clinical practice of anesthesiology . Because of the strong influence of stochastic forces , it does not appear possible to keep a subject reliably in an anesthetized state without exposing them to the potentially dangerous high concentrations of anesthetics associated with subsequently impaired cognition ( Whitlock et al . , 2014; Chan et al . , 2013; Fritz et al . , 2016 ) . Yet , the fact that variability in transition probabilities is constrained offers a possible novel avenue for improvement by developing therapies specifically aimed at state stabilization . Selective stabilization of the unconscious state could provide a solution to minimize the risk of spontaneously shifting into a brain state where awareness is possible , without requiring drug concentrations prone to adverse effects . How might this be achieved ? One possibility is to target the mechanisms that are known to affect the stability of the sleep-wake circuitry . For instance , interference with orexinergic signaling destabilizes both sleep and wake states thereby increasing the frequency of spontaneous transitions between sleep and wakefulness ( Mochizuki et al . , 2004 ) . Interestingly , interference with orexin signaling also affects responses to anesthetics ( Kelz et al . , 2008; Shirasaka et al . , 2011; Tose et al . , 2009; Dong et al . , 2009 ) . Detailed investigation of the synergy between anesthetics and modification of noise inherent in neuronal networks that control sleep and wakefulness may help develop novel therapies that will allow clinicians better control over the state of each individual patient . \n Studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pennsylvania and were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines . For larval zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) experiments , T\u00fcbingen long fin wild-type zebrafish were mated ( Zebrafish International Resource Center , OR ) , and the embryos raised for 5 days in constant darkness . At 5 days post-fertilization ( dpf ) , the larvae were used for the experiments ( n\u00a0=\u00a0120 ) . For mouse experiments , inbred male wild-type C57Bl/6 mice ( Jackson Laboratories , ME ) aged 16\u201324 weeks ( n\u00a0=\u00a060 ) were used in righting reflex behavioral assays . One group of 20 mice was exposed to 0 . 6% and 0 . 9% isoflurane . A second set of 20 mice were exposed to 0 . 3% isoflurane . A third set of 20 mice were exposed to 0 . 4% and 0 . 7% isoflurane . All mice were acclimatized to sealed , temperature-controlled , 200 mL cylindrical chambers with 100% oxygen flowing at 200 mL/minute , as previously described ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) . This flow rate ensures isoflurane chamber equilibration within 5 min ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Mice were exposed to 0 . 90% , 0 . 7% , 0 . 60% , 0 . 4% or 0 . 30% isoflurane in 100% oxygen for 4 hr , beginning at ZT12-ZT14 , corresponding to the period of maximal activity and wakefulness . Chamber isoflurane concentrations in all assays were confirmed using a Riken FI-21 refractometer ( AM Bickford , NY . ) . As tolerance to repeated isoflurane exposures does not occur ( Smith et al . , 1979 ) , mice were exposed to each isoflurane concentration a total of four times over the course of 3 weeks . The presence or absence of the righting reflex ( RR ) was checked every 3 min , starting after 2\u00a0hr of isoflurane exposure to assure pharmacokinetic equilibration . RR was assessed as described previously ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) . A mouse was considered to have an intact righting reflex if it was able to restore its upright posture twice in a row after being turned on its back by rotating the anesthetic chamber without interrupting anesthetic delivery . Otherwise , the righting reflex was considered to be absent . Forty RR assessments were performed per animal per exposure . In total , 160 RR assessments were performed on each mouse at each anesthetic concentration . At 5 days post fertilization ( dpf ) , individual larvae were placed into a 96-well glass plate ( JG Finneran , 500 \u03bcL volume wells ) . Seventy-two zebrafish were exposed to 3 \u03bcM propofol in E3 medium , while 48 zebrafish were exposed to E3 alone ( Kaufman et al . , 2009 ) . Larvae were then placed into the DanioVision ( Noldus , Leesburg VA ) behavioral system . Startle reflex experiments were performed at a maximal intensity tap every 30 s for 4 hr . This choice of inter-stimulus interval was based upon the lack of habituation to acoustic and vibrational stimuli in larval zebrafish when these stimuli are delivered every 15 s ( Burgess and Granato , 2007; Woods et al . , 2014 ) . The histogram of the total distance travelled in the first second after each stimulus was bimodal suggesting an all-or-none response ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . A threshold of 0 . 4 mm ( approximately 1/10 of a 5 dpf zebrafish\u2019s body length ) , was chosen on the basis of this histogram to distinguish between responsive and unresponsive startle reflex assessments ( Kimmel et al . , 1995 ) . The outcomes of the behavioral response assays , righting reflex ( RR ) and startle reflex ( SR ) , are binary . The output is a series of zeros and ones ( one for intact RR or SR and zero otherwise ) . The simplest model that describes this time series is a stochastic Markov process . Markov models relate the state of the system at time\u00a0t to the state of the system observed at the previous time step t \u2212 1 , as Xt = MX t\u22121 , where the 2x2\u00a0transition probability matrix , M , constructed as shown below is the fundamental quantity of interest . M=[a1\u2212a1\u2212bb] In the above matrix , a denotes the probability that the mouse determined to be responsive on trial one will stay responsive on the next trial . b denotes the probability that an animal found to be unresponsive on trial one will stay unresponsive on the next behavioral assessment . Note that because the sum of probabilities in a row of\u00a0M\u00a0must be 1 , probabilities of transitions between the awake and the anesthetized state are completely determined by finding a and\u00a0b in a system with just two states . The simplest possibility is that the probability of being in a particular state at time t is the same for all trials ( i . e . independent of the state of the system ) ( Roman , 1989 ) . This corresponds to a scenario where , b = 1 \u2212 a . This particular type of process is called a Bernoulli process . Conversely , the future outcome of a behavioral trial may depend on the outcome of the previous trial . One manifestation of this history-dependence is inertia; the system tends to persist in a particular state . Inertia increases as the diagonal elements ( a and b ) of the transition probability matrix approach one . a and b were empirically estimated from the binary sequence of behavioral outcomes . For instance , to calculate\u00a0a , we\u00a0computed the fraction of trials where the animal responded to the stimulus on two consecutive trials . Formally , this corresponds to P ( Rt|Rt\u22121 ) or P ( R|R ) . By definition , a Bernoulli process is a stochastic process in which the probability of a given outcome ( positive RR or SR ) is the same for every trial . This is equivalent to adapting the concept of effective concentration to an individual . For a given effective concentration , ec , computed as the overall probability of positive RR or SR , the Bernoulli process can be expressed as the following transition probability matrix . Mb=[ec1\u2212ecec1\u2212ec] Mb\u00a0is completely specified by a single experimentally determined parameter , ec . For the purposes of simulations , we experimentally determined drug potency as the average response probability across all RR or SR trials and simulated the Bernoulli process given by Mb . Mbwas used to simulate 80 experiments consisting of 40 trials each to mimic experimental conditions in mice ( 72 experiments each consisting of 360 trials were simulated for the zebrafish experiments ) . Initial states were randomized in each simulated experiment . To verify that the simulated Bernoulli process and experimental observations give rise to similar drug potency , we compared the simulated and observed\u00a0ec . To test the hypothesis that behavioral observations exhibit inertia or resistance to state transitions , we compared the observed probability of state transitions , P ( U|R ) +P ( R|U ) P ( R|R ) +P ( U|U ) +P ( U|R ) +P ( R|U ) , in the observed and the simulated time series . As an additional test of adequacy for describing experimentally observed time series by a Bernoulli process , we compared the tendency of the system to stay in the unresponsive state , P ( U|U ) , to probability of becoming unresponsive after being responsive on the previous trial , P ( U|R ) . The transition probability matrix for a two-state Markov process has two free parameters . A transition probability matrix estimated for each specific individual can therefore be represented by a point on a plane spanned by the diagonal elements of the matrix . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) was used to capture the maximal inter-individual variance between transition probability matrices . To determine whether the transition probability matrix is a consistent trait of each individual animal , we determined the correlation in position of each individual along the first principal component ( PC ) across time . Statistical significance of this correlation was assessed using a permutation test ( 10 , 000 permutations ) . To quantify how reliably the drug concentration can be inferred from the observed behavioral responses of each individual , we applied Bayes\u2019 theorem:P ( Drug|Response ) =P ( Response|Drug ) P ( Drug ) P ( Response ) This analysis was performed to determine how reliably one can distinguish between exposures to 0 . 6% and 0 . 3% isoflurane in mice or 0 vs . 3 \u03bcM propofol in zebrafish . Since mice exposed to 0 . 6% and 0 . 3% isoflurane were from two separate populations , we wanted to further investigate whether it is possible to infer drug concentration from behavioral responses within an individual exposed to two drug concentrations . For this purpose , we exposed a separate cohort of twenty mice on eight occasions , four times each to 0 . 4% and 0 . 7% isoflurane . Here , the collective trials at each concentration were pooled together for each individual ( 160 trials ) , and a bootstrap resampling technique with replacement was used to generate a response probability distribution for each concentration for each individual mouse . 1000 bootstraps consisting of 20 randomly chosen trials were taken , where the average response probability of each bootstrap was recorded . Probability distribution functions were then fit to each mouse\u2019s bootstrapped response probabilities for both isoflurane concentrations . Overlap between the two concentrations was computed for each mouse by finding the union of the two distributions . At the population level , response probability distributions were computed based on average response probabilities for each animal , and overlap was computed in a similar fashion . The population response probabilities observed in Figure 2B and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 suggest a shallower dose-response as compared to previously published population-based dose-response curves ( Friedman et al . , 2010; Joiner et al . , 2013; Sun et al . , 2006 ) . In order to compute the aggregate dose-response , we fit sigmoid curves to jackknifed subsamples across all tested isoflurane concentrations . Data from one animal at each concentration was removed for each subsample , and the remaining subset of data was fitted to a sigmoidal curve:1\u2212R=11+ ( EC50/Iso ) Hwhere R is the righting probability , Iso is the isoflurane concentration and the two paramters EC50 and H are the half-maximal effect concentration and the Hill slope respectively . Fits were calculated such that the sum of the squared error was minimized between the subsample values and sigmoid . We constrained the fit such that the sigmoid value was 1 at 0 . 0% isoflurane , and 0 at 0 . 9% isoflurane . Mean and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the EC50 and the Hill slope . The modeling approach here is essentially identical to that in Proekt and Hudson ( 2018 ) and Moreno-Bote et al . ( 2007 ) . Activity patterns of the bistable neuronal network consisting of two neurons can be parametrized as a function of the difference between activity of \u03b1 neurons and \u03b2 neurons x\u00a0=\u00a0Activity\u03b1-Acivity\u03b2 . To express the fact that mutual inhibition and self-excitation give rise to the winner-take-all behavior , Moreno-Bote et al . ( 2007 ) used the following energy function that we adapt here:E ( x ) =x2 ( X22\u22122 ) This function has two energy minima x= ( \u22121 , 1 ) corresponding to \u03b2-dominated ( \u2018anesthetized\u2019 ) and \u03b1-dominated ( \u2018awake\u2019 ) activity states , respectively . To add the effects of anesthetics we modified this function as follows ( Proekt and Hudson , 2018 ) E ( x , i ) =x2 ( X22\u22122 ) +i ( x\u22121 ) 2+ ( 1\u2212i ) ( x+1 ) 2where i is the anesthetic concentration i \u2208 [0 , 1] in arbitrary units . Note that in this equation , the effect of anesthetic on stabilizing the anesthetized state is proportional to that destabilizing the awake state . This was done to reflect the results shown in Figures 4 and 6 which show strong negative correlation between P ( U|U ) and P ( R|R ) in both mice and zebrafish . Individual differences in righting probability were simulated by changing i . This results in deepening the energy well in the vicinity of x=-1 and making the well in the vicinity of x\u00a0=\u00a01 proportionally shallower . Time evolution of the state of the network , x , was simulated as diffusion on an energy function using the standard approach:dxdt=\u2212D\u2202E ( x , i ) \u2202x+\u03f5where D is the diffusion constant ( assumed to be one in all simulations for simplicity ) . The first term in the equation reflects the energy gradient . This assures that the system tends towards energy minima . The second term , \u03b5 , is zero mean Gaussian noise . To modulate the amount of noise in the system , the standard deviation , \u03c3 , of noise was altered parametrically . Simulations of this diffusion equation were performed for 1 , 000 , 000 time steps . While x varies continuously , the distribution of x is bimodal with peaks near the energy troughs x= ( \u22121 , 1 ) . To compare simulations to our experimental results on RR and SR modeled using a two-state Markov process , we binarized x such that x\u00a0>\u00a00 was classified as \u2018anesthetized\u2019 and x\u00a0\u2264\u00a00 was classified as \u2018awake\u2019 . To further mimic the fact that RR and SR are performed intermittently , the binarized time series from the simulation was decimated 100 fold . This binary time series was modeled by a two-state transition probability matrix using the same methods as for the analysis of the RR and SR . The results of these simulations for different anesthetic concentrations and \u03c3\u2019s is shown in Figure 8D . Analyses were performed using custom code written in Matlab using the Statistics and Machine Learning toolboxes ( Mathworks , MA ) . Steady state population response probabilities were confirmed through Pearson correlation coefficient analysis between the trial index and the response probability averaged across animals . R2 values approaching zero indicate that the population is near a steady state . Statistical comparisons of medians were performed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test . The Brown-Forsythe test for equal variances was used to compare variability in simulated and experimental response probabilities . p<0 . 05 were considered statistically significant for all comparisons ."}

Notably , it has been shown that people tend to underestimate speeds when visibility is reduced equally at all distances , as for example , when driving with a fogged up windshield . But what happens when the visibility decreases as you look further into the distance , as happens when driving in fog ? Fortunately , as new research reveals , people tend to overestimate their speed when driving in fog-like conditions , and show a natural tendency to drive at a slower pace . Pretto et al . performed a series of experiments involving experienced drivers and high-quality virtual reality simulations . In one experiment , drivers were presented with two driving scenes and asked to guess which scene was moving faster . In the reference scene , the car was driving at a fixed speed through a landscape under conditions of clear visibility; in the test scene , it was moving through the same landscape , again at a fixed speed , but with the visibility reduced in different ways . The experiments showed that drivers overestimated speeds in fog-like conditions , and they underestimated speeds when the reduction in visibility did not depend on distance . Further experiments confirmed that these perceptions had an influence on driving behaviour: drivers recorded an average speed of 85 . 1 km/hr when the visibility was good , and this dropped to 70 . 9 km/hr in severe fog . However , when visibility was reduced equally at all distances , as happens with a fogged up windshield , the average driving speed increased to 101 . 3 km/hr . Based on previous work , Pretto et al . developed the theory that the perception of speed is influenced by the relative speeds of the visible regions in the scene . When looking directly into the fog , visibility is strongly reduced in the distant regions , where the relative motion is slow , and is preserved in the near regions , where the motion is fast . This visibility gradient would lead to speed overestimation . To test this theory , the experiments were repeated with new drivers under three different conditions: good visibility , fog , and an artificial situation called \u2018anti-fog\u2019 in which visibility is poor in the near regions and improves as the driver looks further into the distance . As predicted , the estimated speed was lower in anti-fog than in clear visibility and fog . Conversely , the driving speed was 104 . 4 km/hr in anti-fog compared with 67 . 9 km/hr in good visibility and 51 . 3 km/hr in fog . Overall , the results show that the perception of speed is influenced by spatial variations in visibility , and they strongly suggest that this is due to the relative speed contrast between the visible and covert areas within the scene .", "source": "Visual speed is believed to be underestimated at low contrast , which has been proposed as an explanation of excessive driving speed in fog . Combining psychophysics measurements and driving simulation , we confirm that speed is underestimated when contrast is reduced uniformly for all objects of the visual scene independently of their distance from the viewer . However , we show that when contrast is reduced more for distant objects , as is the case in real fog , visual speed is actually overestimated , prompting drivers to decelerate . Using an artificial anti-fog\u2014that is , fog characterized by better visibility for distant than for close objects , we demonstrate for the first time that perceived speed depends on the spatial distribution of contrast over the visual scene rather than the global level of contrast per se . Our results cast new light on how reduced visibility conditions affect perceived speed , providing important insight into the human visual system . \n Visual contrast is usually referred to as the difference in brightness between an object and the background ( Hofstetter et al . , 2000 ) . Classical vision research experiments systematically investigated how visual contrast affects objects motion perception ( Thompson , 1982; Stone and Thompson , 1992; Blakemore and Snowden , 1999; Anstis , 2003 ) . These studies have shown that the perceived speed of two-dimensional moving objects\u2014for example , plaid patterns on a computer screen\u2014is underestimated when visual contrast is reduced . More recent studies based on driving scenarios have suggested that the underestimation of visual speed at low contrast applies also to perceived self-motion in three-dimensional environments ( Snowden et al . , 1998; Horswill and Plooy , 2008; Owens et al . , 2010 ) . This finding was proposed\u2014and is still considered\u2014as a possible explanation for excessive driving speed in fog . In the abovementioned studies , and more generally in all studies having assessed the effect of visual contrast on motion perception , contrast was reduced uniformly for all objects of the visual scene , irrespective of their distance from the observer . While uniform contrast reduction is a valid model to assess the perception of two-dimensional patterns moving on a computer screen , it is a poor model to investigate how an atmospheric phenomenon like fog affects motion perception in three-dimensional environments . Specifically , fog alters visual contrast because tiny water droplets suspended in the air are interposed between the observer and the surrounding objects . The quantity of droplets increases along the line-of-sight as distance from the observer increases . As a consequence , the contrast of the visual scene decreases with distance , and visibility is better for close than for distant objects . Therefore , the distance-dependent attenuation of contrast experienced in fog is obviously very different from the uniform reduction traditionally adopted in vision research . Uniform contrast reduction resembles more closely what one could experience when looking at the environment through a dirty glass or a foggy windshield . To date , the effects of distance-dependent contrast reduction on motion perception are unknown . In other words , we still do not know how fog affects perceived self-motion . Here , we tested the perceptual and behavioural effects of distance-dependent contrast reduction\u2014that is , fog\u2014on speed perception . We compared these effects with those of the distance-independent\u2014that is , uniform\u2014contrast reduction that has been used in previous studies to simulate fog ( Snowden et al . , 1998; Horswill and Plooy , 2008; Owens et al . , 2010 ) . To perform these experiments , we used a state-of-the-art virtual reality setup allowing us to realistically simulate fog in an ecological driving scenario ( Loomis et al . , 1999 ) . \n In the first experiment , we used a standard psychophysical procedure to test how contrast affects perceived visual speed . Twelve experienced drivers were presented with pairs of driving scenes and instructed to estimate which scene moved faster ( Figure 1A ) . One of the scenes ( reference ) had clear visibility and moved at one of three target speeds ( 40 , 60 , or 90 km/hr ) . The other scene ( test ) had either clear or reduced visibility , and its speed was adjusted for each trial using a Bayesian adaptive method ( Kontsevich and Tyler , 1999 ) . This method allowed us to determine the point of subjective equality ( PSE ) as well as the just-noticeable difference ( JND ) . The PSE corresponded to the speed at which the two scenes were perceived as moving equally fast . Therefore , PSEs higher than the actual speed of the reference scene indicated speed underestimation , whereas PSEs lower than the speed of the reference scene indicated speed overestimation . The JND corresponded to the smallest detectable difference between two different speeds . High JNDs indicated low discrimination sensitivity , whereas low JNDs indicated high discrimination sensitivity . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00031 . 003Figure 1 . Experimental design and time course of trials . ( A ) Experiments 1 and 3: for each trial , the first scene was presented for 700 ms , which included a 100-ms fade-in phase at the beginning and a 100-ms fade-out phase at the end . The second scene was presented 300 ms after the end of the first scene and had the same temporal structure as the first one . Participants had to fixate a central cross for the whole duration of the trial . The order of presentation of the reference and test scene was randomized . ( B ) Experiments 2 and 4: three driving sessions ( i . e . , one per target speed ) were performed in random order for experiment 2 , and one session for experiment 4 . Before each test session , the drivers performed a training phase in which a numerical feedback indicated the driving speed when it did not match the target speed ( white digits at the bottom of the screen , left panel ) . In each training phase , the drivers had to drive a total of 5 min at target speed . In addition , at the beginning of each test trial , the scene was shown for 7 s moving at target speed with clear visibility ( memory refresher ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00031 . 003 The contrast of the scene was reduced either in a distance-dependent manner , as would happen in natural fog , or in a distance-independent manner , as has been done in previous experiments . The difference between these two types of contrast reduction is represented in Figure 2B and C . Moderate and severe levels of reduction were implemented for each type of contrast alteration . Importantly , for each level of reduction , the overall visual contrast was the same for distance-dependent and distance-independent alteration ( Root mean square [RMS] contrast = 0 . 31 for moderate visibility reduction and 0 . 19 for severe visibility reduction , vs 0 . 46 for clear visibility ) . In total , the experiment consisted of five visibility conditions: clear ( no contrast reduction ) , moderate and severe fog ( distance-dependent contrast reduction ) , moderate and severe uniform reduction ( distance-independent contrast reduction ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00031 . 004Figure 2 . Visibility conditions . ( A ) Clear weather conditions ( clear visibility ) : contrast is unaltered and the visibility is optimal in all directions ( brown line ) . ( B ) Distance-independent contrast reduction ( uniform contrast ) : visibility drops equally for all objects of the visual scene , irrespective of their distance from the observer ( green lines ) . ( C ) Distance-dependent contrast reduction ( fog ) : visibility is good for close objects , and worsens as distance from the observer increases ( red lines ) . ( D ) Reversed distance-dependent contrast reduction ( anti-fog ) : visibility is poor for close objects , and improves as distance from the observer increases ( blue lines ) . ( E ) Pictures of the actual setup: side view ( left ) and driver's view ( right ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00031 . 004 Reducing the contrast of the visual scene altered speed perception [F ( 4 , 44 ) = 52 . 086 , p<0 . 001 , \u03b7G2 = 0 . 61] . However , as shown in Figure 3A , perceived speed was affected differently by the two types of contrast reduction . Specifically , when contrast reduction depended on distance , participants matched lower speeds ( PSE mean = 54 . 7 and 41 . 7 km/hr for moderate and severe fog , respectively ) to the perceived speed under clear visibility ( mean = 65 km/hr ) . This indicates that natural fog led to an overestimation of speed ( equivalent to 76 . 4 and 94 . 3 km/hr for moderate and severe fog , respectively; Figure 3A ) . Conversely , when visibility was reduced in a distance-independent manner , higher speeds ( PSE mean = 95 . 5 and 95 . 2 km/hr for moderate and severe uniform reduction , respectively ) were matched to the perceived speed under clear visibility . Therefore , speed was underestimated with uniform contrast reduction ( perceived speed equivalent to 41 . 4 and 41 . 5 km/hr for moderate and severe reduction , respectively ) . Each condition differed from each of the others ( p<0 . 05 ) , except for uniform-moderate and uniform-severe reduction that did not differ significantly from one another . The same pattern of results was observed for all three target speeds . These results show that the two types of contrast reduction gave rise to opposite perceptual effects . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00031 . 005Figure 3 . Opposite effects of distance-dependent and distance-independent contrast reduction . Experiments 1 and 2 . ( A ) Mean perceived driving speed across subjects as a function of visibility: for each subject , PSE values were averaged across the three target speeds ( i . e . , 40 , 60 , and 90 km/hr ) , then perceived speed was calculated using the following equation: Speedperceived = PSEclear + PSEclear \u00d7 ln ( PSEclear/PSEreduced visibility ) . As compared to clear visibility ( brown dashed line ) , speed was overestimated with distance-dependent visibility reduction ( red bars ) and underestimated with distance-independent visibility reduction ( green bars ) . ( B ) Mean produced driving speed across subjects as a function of visibility: for each subject , measured speed values were averaged across the three target speeds . As compared to their driving speed with clear visibility ( brown dashed line ) , drivers drove slower with distance-dependent visibility reduction ( red bars ) and faster with distance-independent visibility reduction ( green bars ) . In both ( A ) and ( B ) , the error bars represent the standard error of the mean . PSE: point of subjective equality . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00031 . 005 Reducing visibility also affected speed discrimination sensitivity [F ( 4 , 44 ) = 29 . 58 , p<0 . 001 , \u03b7G2 = 0 . 37] , which was significantly lower ( higher JNDs ) in the two conditions in which visibility was reduced in a distance-independent manner ( mean = 0 . 58 km/hr for both moderate and severe uniform reduction ) , as compared to the other three conditions that did not differ from one another ( mean = 0 . 41 , 0 . 40 , and 0 . 42 km/hr for clear , moderate , and severe fog , respectively ) . This indicates that the participants had more difficulties estimating the driving speed when visibility reduction was independent of distance . This reduction of speed discrimination sensitivity might result from the fact that distance-independent contrast alteration is seldom encountered in real life . Specifically , although entering a car with a foggy windshield is common , especially due to cold weather , drivers usually demist their windshield before starting to drive . Unfortunately , drivers' options to reduce environmental fog are much more restricted . In the second experiment , we tested whether the perceptual changes measured in the first experiment affect actual driving behaviour . Ten experienced drivers who did not participate in the first experiment were instructed to drive at target speeds with either clear or reduced visibility . The visibility conditions and target speeds were the same as in experiment 1 . In a preliminary training phase , drivers learned to reach and maintain each target speed with clear visibility ( Figure 1B , left pane ) . In the test phase , drivers freely controlled their driving speed with the gas pedal , and pressed a button when thinking they were driving at target speed ( Figure 1B , right pane ) . To refresh drivers' memory , the scene was shortly presented moving at the target speed with clear visibility at the beginning of each trial . Driving speed was affected by the contrast of the visual scene [F ( 4 , 36 ) = 43 . 18 , p<0 . 001 , \u03b7G2 = 0 . 44] . However , as for perceived speed , the direction of the effect depended on the type of contrast reduction . As compared to clear visibility ( mean = 85 . 1 km/hr ) , the participants drove significantly slower with distance-dependent contrast reduction ( mean = 77 . 3 and 70 . 9 km/hr for moderate and severe fog , respectively ) , but faster with distance-independent reduction ( mean = 93 . 6 and 101 . 3 km/hr for moderate and severe uniform reduction , respectively; see Figure 3B ) . The five visibility conditions differed significantly from one another ( p<0 . 05 ) , and the same pattern was observed for all three target speeds . These behavioural results are consistent with the perceptual results of the first experiment and can be interpreted as follows: distance-dependent contrast reduction induces an overestimation of visual speed that prompts drivers to drive slower , whereas distance-independent contrast reduction evokes an underestimation of visual speed , prompting drivers to drive faster . The results of the first two experiments highlight that the distance-dependent contrast reduction experienced in fog evokes perceptual and behavioural effects that are radically opposite to those resulting from the distance-independent contrast reduction traditionally adopted in vision research . Such a radical difference is striking because in our experiments , the two types of contrast reduction resulted in the same global attenuation of visual contrast . This suggests that the global level of contrast is not the only factor affecting perceived speed . The spatial distribution of contrast over the visual scene also seems to play a critical role . Yet , what are the perceptual mechanisms underlying speed overestimation in fog ? In fog , visibility\u2014that is , contrast\u2014is reduced with distance . Therefore , when the driver looks straight ahead , the regions of better visibility in the proximity of the vehicle are typically viewed in peripheral vision , whereas the distant regions where visibility is impaired fall in the centre of the driver's visual field ( Snowden and Freeman , 2004 ) . In this situation , fog acts as a mask obscuring the central region of the visual field . Recently , we have shown that speed perception strongly depends on the visible portion of the visual field ( Pretto et al . , 2009 ) . In particular , we found that speed is overestimated when the central area is occluded , and underestimated when it is the peripheral area that is masked . A similar phenomenon could explain why speed is overestimated in fog , that is , when contrast is reduced in a distance-dependent manner . More specifically , speed overestimation in fog could result from the relative contrast between the central and peripheral areas of the visual field . To test this hypothesis , we created an anti-fog , that is , a distance-dependent contrast reduction characterized by an increase of visibility with distance ( see Figure 2D ) . With anti-fog , visibility was better for distant than for close objects , that is , visibility was good for the portion of road situated at a distance ahead , and poor for the direct surroundings of the vehicle . In other words , normal fog and anti-fog resulted in opposite spatial distributions of contrast over the visual scene , although the global contrast reduction was the same for both fog types . We hypothesized that if the relative contrast between central and peripheral areas of the visual field underlies the speed overestimation observed with fog , then speed should be underestimated with the anti-fog . In the third experiment , we used the same psychophysical procedure as in the first experiment to compare the effect of natural fog and anti-fog on perceived speed . Ten experienced drivers who had not participated in the first two experiments were presented with pairs of driving scenes and instructed to estimate which scene moved faster ( see methods of experiment 1 ) . Three visibility conditions were used: clear , fog , and anti-fog . Only one target speed was used ( 60 km/hr ) as the first two experiments revealed the same pattern of results for all three target speeds . As shown in Figure 4A , perceived speed depended on visibility [F ( 2 , 18 ) = 65 . 64 , p<0 . 001 , \u03b7G2 = 0 . 81] . With fog , lower speeds ( mean PSE = 47 . 7 km/hr ) were matched to the perceived speed with clear visibility ( mean PSE = 60 . 1 km/hr ) , whereas higher speeds were matched to it with anti-fog ( mean PSE = 121 . 6 km/hr ) . Therefore , as compared to clear visibility , the scenes were perceived as moving faster with fog ( equivalent to 74 . 3 km/hr , Figure 4A ) and slower with anti-fog ( equivalent to 19 km/hr ) . All three visibility conditions differed significantly from one another ( p<0 . 05 ) . Visibility also affected speed discrimination sensitivity [F ( 2 , 18 ) = 82 . 85 , p<0 . 001 , \u03b7G2 = 0 . 79] . JND was twice as high in the anti-fog condition ( mean = 0 . 543 km/hr ) than in the other two conditions that did not differ from one another ( mean = 0 . 248 and 0 . 225 km/hr for clear and fog , respectively ) . This indicates that estimating driving speed was more difficult in the anti-fog condition , which likely results from the completely artificial nature of this type of contrast reduction . Indeed , anti-fog is a type of contrast alteration that never occurs in real life . In that respect , it is interesting to mention that reduced speed discrimination performance was observed with both unusual types of contrast reduction , namely anti-fog here and uniform contrast reduction in the first experiment . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00031 . 006Figure 4 . Opposite effects of fog and anti-fog . Experiments 3 and 4 . ( A ) Mean perceived driving speed across subjects as a function of visibility: Perceived speed was calculated from the measured PSEs using the following equation: Speedperceived = PSEclear + PSEclear \u00d7 ln ( PSEclear/PSEreduced visibility ) . As compared to clear visibility ( brown dashed line ) , speed was overestimated when visibility was better for close than for distant objects , that is , in fog ( red bars ) , and underestimated when visibility was better for distant than for close objects , that is , anti-fog ( blue bars ) . ( B ) Mean produced driving speed across subjects as a function of visibility: As compared to their driving speed with clear visibility ( brown dashed line ) , drivers drove slower when visibility was better for close than for distant objects , that is , in fog ( red bars ) , and faster when visibility was better for distant than for close objects , that is , anti-fog ( blue bars ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00031 . 006 The same 10 participants took part in a fourth experiment where they were instructed to drive at target speeds with either clear or reduced visibility ( same driving procedure as experiment 2 ) . This experiment aimed to compare the effects of fog and anti-fog on produced driving speed . The visibility and speed conditions were identical to those used in experiment 3 . The order of experiments 3 and 4 was counterbalanced between participants . Driving speed was affected by visibility [F ( 2 , 18 ) = 39 . 99 , p<0 . 001 , \u03b7G2 = 0 . 71] . Specifically , as compared to clear visibility ( mean = 67 . 9 km/hr ) , participants drove slower with fog ( mean = 53 . 1 km/hr ) and faster with anti-fog ( mean = 104 . 4 km/hr , see Figure 4B ) . All three conditions differed from one another ( p<0 . 05 ) . Visibility also affected the variability of driving speed [F ( 2 , 18 ) = 9 . 56 , p<0 . 01 , \u03b7G2 = 0 . 33] , which was twice as large in the anti-fog condition ( mean = 17 . 6 km/hr ) as in the other two conditions that did not differ from one another ( mean = 9 and 7 . 5 km/hr for clear visibility and fog , respectively ) . \n Previous studies suggested that the speed of visual motion in depth is underestimated when the global level of contrast is reduced ( Snowden et al . , 1998; Horswill and Plooy , 2008; Owens et al . , 2010 ) . These studies were directly inspired by classical vision research experiments that assessed the effect of contrast on the perceived speed of two-dimensional objects on a monitor ( Thompson , 1982; Stone and Thompson , 1992; Blakemore and Snowden , 1999; Anstis , 2003 ) . In the present study , we reproduced this perceptual bias , showing that visual speed is indeed underestimated when contrast is reduced in a distance-independent manner . However , we show that this is only part of the whole picture . In particular , we demonstrate here for the first time that an identical global loss of visibility can evoke opposite percepts , depending on the nature of the underlying visual contrast reduction . Therefore , contrarily to what has been consistently reported in previous studies , a global contrast reduction can also lead to an overestimation of visual speed . This is notably the case when contrast is not reduced uniformly for all objects of the visual scene but varies according to their distance from the viewer . For instance , in fog , contrast reduction is more important for distant than for close objects . This generates a distance-dependent visibility gradient between the peripheral and central area of the visual field . Our results show that in this situation , perceived speed is not determined by the global level of contrast per se , but rather by the spatial distribution of contrast over the visual scene . More specifically , perceived speed is determined by the relative contrast between the central and peripheral areas of the visual field . When visibility is better in the peripheral than in the central visual field , as is the case in fog , speed is overestimated . Inverting the direction of the contrast gradient with anti-fog and thereby obscuring more the peripheral than the central region of the visual field , inverts the perceptual bias such that speed is now underestimated . This highlights the critical role of the visibility gradient in perceived speed , explaining why speed is unexpectedly overestimated in fog despite a global reduction of visibility . Importantly , our results also evidence the direct relationship between perceived and produced speed . Specifically , speed overestimation systematically prompted drivers to drive slower , whereas speed underestimation led to faster driving paces . This demonstrates that driving speed is strongly affected by perceived visual speed . In \u2018real-life\u2019 driving , the roadsides usually include various objects and landmarks as trees , buildings , traffic signs , or pedestrians . Such objects next to the road can have a cognitive influence on driving speed because they constitute potential obstacles that increase the risk of collision ( e . g . , tree or building if one drives out of the road and cars or pedestrians suddenly crossing the road ) . However , we were interested in the perceptual and not in the cognitive effects of contrast reduction on driving speed . Therefore , the roadsides of our driving scenario consisted of a grass texture clear of any object and landmark . This prevented cognitive factors as those mentioned above to bias our results , but importantly , it also prevented subjects of using these landmarks to estimate moving speed . Indeed , adding landmarks or other \u2018higher-level\u2019 cues would have given the subjects the possibility to use some cognitive strategies to estimate speed . For instance , subjects could have used relative size information of landmarks to infer distances and counted passing them to assess speed . Undoubtedly , this would have biased our results . Yet , one could argue that at a \u2018pure\u2019 perceptual level , objects next to the road can also contribute to increase peripheral visual flow , thereby altering perceived speed . This would be mostly true with a driving environment that provides only little visual flow information ( e . g . , very smooth road pavement and roadsides ) . However , the scene we used consisted of a rough asphalt pavement and roughly textured grass roadsides ( see Figure 2 ) . These rough textures provided participants with rich visual flow information when driving , as attested by our results . Specifically , in the \u2018clear visibility\u2019 condition , participants estimated visual speed with great accuracy . In addition , the variability of speed estimates was small ( i . e . , low JNDs ) in all conditions , and even more with clear visibility . Those elements indicate that our driving scenario provided robust visual flow information allowing for reliable speed estimates . Contrast-dependent modulation of neural activity has been reported at early stages of visual processing , as the retina ( Shapley and Victor , 1978 ) , the lateral geniculate nucleus ( Solomon et al . , 2002 ) , and the primary visual cortex ( Levitt and Lund , 1997; Polat et al . , 1998; Sceniak et al . , 1999 ) . It has also been reported in the middle temporal area ( MT or V5 ) , an area playing an important role in motion processing ( Pack et al . , 2005; Bartels et al . , 2008 ) and speed detection ( Maunsell and Van Essen , 1983b ) , notably via feedforward projections to the medial superior temporal area ( Maunsell and van Essen , 1983a; Ungerleider and Desimone , 1986 ) . Yet , linking these neurophysiological findings with the effect of contrast on perceived speed in humans is not straightforward . For instance , the observation that MT neurons tuned to high speeds are strongly activated by slow stimuli at low contrast ( Pack et al . , 2005 ) would predict speed overestimation at low contrast . This is the opposite of what has been usually observed with uniform contrast reduction , including in the current study . As stated by Pack et al . ( 2005 ) , this inconsistency might be resolved by assuming a bias towards slow speeds when the total MT population activity is low . Such a bias towards slow speed is precisely what is proposed by Bayesian models of speed perception ( Weiss et al . , 2002; Stocker and Simoncelli , 2006 ) . Specifically , these models rely on the assumption that speed \u2018measurements\u2019 are intrinsically noisy , and that based on our everyday experience , slower motions are more likely to occur than faster ones\u2014resulting in an elevated prior for slow speeds . Whereas Bayesian models of speed perception can accurately predict speed underestimation at low contrast ( Stocker and Simoncelli , 2006 ) , speed overestimation observed at higher speeds ( Thompson et al . , 2006 ) and at low luminance ( Hammett et al . , 2007 ) are more difficult to account for . Alternative models have proposed that speed is encoded as \u2018the ratio of the responses of physiologically plausible temporal filters\u2019 ( Hammett et al . , 2000; Hammett et al . , 2005 ) . These \u2018ratio models\u2019 account for both under- and overestimation of speed at low contrast ( Thompson et al . , 2006 ) . However , none of the abovementioned models addressed situations in which the amount of contrast reduction differed for different areas of the moving visual scene , as is the case when driving in fog . In that respect , these models do not explain the differences in speed perception observed here with uniform and distance-dependent contrast reduction . They do not account for opposite biases evoked with the same global contrast reduction at the same actual speed . Poor visibility conditions affect millions of drivers around the world . Thousands of them die each year in a car accident . Excessive speed constitutes a major causal factor for these car accidents . We show here for the first time how fog biases speed perception , and we reveal the perceptual mechanisms underlying this bias , providing important insights into the human visual system . In particular , we show that contrarily to what was previously believed , speed is overestimated in fog because visibility is poorer in the central than in the peripheral area of the visual field . We also show that the behavioural consequence of this speed overestimation is a natural tendency to drive at a slower pace . Therefore , drivers should probably listen to their visual system when it prompts them to decelerate . \n Thirty-two experienced drivers ( 23 males and 9 females; aged 21\u201335 years , mean = 25 . 3 years ) participated voluntarily in the study ( 12 in experiment 1 , 10 in experiment 2 , and 10 in experiments 3 and 4 ) . All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision . They were paid , naive as to the purpose of the research , and gave their informed consent before taking part in the experiment . The study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki , in line with Max Planck Society policy and in compliance with all relevant German legislation . The participants had the option to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty and without having to give a reason . All experiments were performed in an immersive virtual environment . For all experiments , the participants were seated in a simplified vehicle mock-up equipped with steering wheel and pedals . The steering wheel haptic feedback was disabled so that no speed information could be inferred from the wheel feedback . Also , the steering wheel rotation amplitude was linearly mapped to the vehicle turning speed and applied on the centre of mass of the vehicle . This way , a small rotation of the steering wheel resulted in a slow rotation of the vehicle around its vertical axis , whereas a large steering wheel rotation led to a fast turning , independently of the actual longitudinal speed of the vehicle . The mock-up was located at the centre of a large semi-spherical screen equipped with a multi-projection system . The panoramic screen surrounded the observer to provide an image that embraces almost the entire human visual field . More specifically , a cylindrical screen with a curved extension onto the floor provided a projection surface of 230\u00b0 ( horizontally ) \u00d7 125\u00b0 ( vertically ) . The resulting surface was entirely covered by four LCD projectors , with a resolution of 1400 \u00d7 1050 pixels each . Overlapping regions were blended by openWARP technology ( Eyevis , Reutlingen , Germany ) . The geometry of the scene was adjusted for an eye height of 0 . 8 m at a distance of 3 m from the vertical screen . The virtual environment was created using 3DVIA Virtools 4 . 1 ( Dassault Systemes , V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay , France ) behavioural engine , which was running distributed on a 5-PCs cluster , one for each of the projectors and a supervisor . The visual stimulus consisted of a virtual environment where a textured plane reproducing a straight single-lane road was scrolled at different speeds . The central surface of the plane was a rough asphalt pavement , whereas the sides were covered with grass-like textures . The sky consisted of a homogenous grey texture with the same colour of the fog and the plane used for the uniform contrast reduction ( RGB = [128 , 128 , 128] ) . Visual contrast was reduced by blending the fog colour ( RGB = [128 , 128 , 128] ) into the virtual scene , according to the alpha blending model Cr = Co \u03b1 + Cf ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) , where , for each pixel of the projected image , Cr is the resulting colour , Co is the original colour , Cf is the colour of the fog , and \u03b1 is the blending factor . For the distance-dependent contrast reduction , the blending factor was determined by e\u2212f\u00b7d , where f is the density of the fog and d is the distance from the observer to the depicted object . The colour of each pixel was converted into the corresponding brightness ( the arithmetic mean of the red , green , and blue colour coordinates in the RGB colour space ) , and the scene luminance distribution was computed based on the empirically determined function between luminance and brightness . The function was determined in two phases: ( i ) a plane model with uniform colour ( brightness ) was displayed on the screen facing the observer , and luminance was measured on its surface with a Minolta LS-100 photometer ( Konica Minolta , Tokyo , Japan ) for several brightness levels; ( ii ) the readings of the photometer were plotted against the corresponding brightness and fitted ( R2 = 0 . 999 ) by a quadratic function that was then used to compute the luminance distribution of the scene for each visibility condition . The contrast of the scene was then computed as the RMS of the luminance ( in cd/m2 ) of the pixels in the virtual scene ( similarly to what Snowden et al . , 1998 did in their work ) . We set the fog density value to 0 . 1 for the medium visibility condition and 0 . 3 for the poor condition , in a range from 0 ( full visibility ) to 1 ( no visibility ) . These values correspond to a meteorological visibility range ( MVR ) of 30 and 10 m , respectively . The MVR indicates the distance at which a white object appears with a 5% contrast ( Kovalev and Eichinger , 2004 ) . The distance-independent ( uniform ) contrast reduction was implemented by inserting a transparent virtual plane in front of the scene . The plane brightness was composited with the brightness of the background image , according to the standard alpha blending model described previously . The opacity of the plane was adjusted to 0 . 28 and 0 . 52 in order to match the contrast of the moderate and severe fog conditions , respectively . The global attenuation of visibility was identical for both types of contrast reduction ( RMS = 0 . 46 for clear visibility , 0 . 31 for moderate contrast reduction , and 0 . 19 for severe contrast reduction ) . Anti-fog ( experiments 3 and 4 ) was obtained using a vertex shader technique ( Engel , 2005 ) . The blending factor was set to 1 \u2212 e\u2212af\u00b7d , where af is the density of anti-fog , which was adjusted to match the overall scene contrast of the fog condition ( RMS = 0 . 24 ) . For the two-interval forced-choice ( 2IFC ) procedure used in experiments 1 and 3 , 80 trials per condition were performed , for a total of 1200 randomly interleaved trials in experiment 1 ( two sessions of six blocks each , total duration of 2 . 5 hr ) and 240 in experiment 3 ( two blocks , total duration of 30 min ) . For experiments 2 and 4 , each subject performed five trials per condition , and mean driving speed was computed for each subject and condition . Experiment 2 consisted of 25 trials , performed in five consecutive blocks , and lasted 2 hr in total . Experiment 4 lasted 1 . 5 hr , consisting of three blocks of five trials each . For all experiments , the order of presentation of the trials was fully randomized and different for all subjects . During the 5-min breaks between two consecutive blocks and the 15-min break between two sessions , the lights of the experimental room were switched on and subjects could walk and relax . Mean PSE and JND values in experiment 1 and mean driving speed values in experiment 2 were analysed using a 5 \u00d7 3 ( contrast reduction [clear visibility , moderate fog , severe fog , moderate uniform reduction , and severe uniform reduction] , target speed [40 , 60 , and 90 km/hr] ) repeated-measures ( within subjects design ) analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) . Mean PSE and JND values in experiment 3 and mean driving speed values in experiment 4 were analysed using a 3 ( contrast reduction [clear visibility , fog , and anti-fog] ) repeated-measures ANOVA . The reported values are Huynh\u2013Feldt corrected , and post hoc tests using the Holm adjustment method for multiple comparisons ( p<0 . 05 ) were performed when necessary ."}

Humans regenerate poorly after many injuries , especially when the brain becomes damaged after stroke , disease or trauma . On the other hand , planarians \u2013 small worms that live in fresh water \u2013 regenerate exceptionally well . A whole planarian can regenerate from small pieces of tissue . The ability of planarians to regenerate their nervous system relies on stem cells called neoblasts , which can migrate through the body and divide to replace lost cells . However , the specific mechanisms responsible for regenerating nervous tissue are largely unknown . Roberts-Galbraith et al . carried out a screen to identify genes that tell planarians whether to regenerate a new brain , what cells to make and how to arrange them . The study revealed over thirty genes that allow planarians to regenerate their brains after their heads have been amputated . These genes play several different roles in the animal . Some of the genes help neoblasts to make decisions about what kinds of cells they should become . One gene is needed to make an important connection in the planarian brain after injury . Another helps to restore the ability of the planarian to sense its food . The experiments also show that some key genes are switched on in a new cell type that might produce signals to support regeneration . Lastly , Roberts-Galbraith et al . found that the planarian nervous system contains cells called glia . Previous studies have shown that many of the cells in the human brain are glia and that these cells help nerve cells to survive and work properly . The discovery of glia in planarians means that it will be possible to use these worms to study how glia support brain regeneration and how glia themselves are replaced after injury . In the long term , this work might lead to discoveries that shed light on how tissue regeneration could be improved in humans .", "source": "Planarians regenerate all body parts after injury , including the central nervous system ( CNS ) . We capitalized on this distinctive trait and completed a gene expression-guided functional screen to identify factors that regulate diverse aspects of neural regeneration in Schmidtea mediterranea . Our screen revealed molecules that influence neural cell fates , support the formation of a major connective hub , and promote reestablishment of chemosensory behavior . We also identified genes that encode signaling molecules with roles in head regeneration , including some that are produced in a previously uncharacterized parenchymal population of cells . Finally , we explored genes downregulated during planarian regeneration and characterized , for the first time , glial cells in the planarian CNS that respond to injury by repressing several transcripts . Collectively , our studies revealed diverse molecules and cell types that underlie an animal\u2019s ability to regenerate its brain . \n An improved understanding of brain regeneration holds the potential to stimulate new therapies geared toward the\u00a0treatment of stroke , neurological disease , and brain injury . Brain regeneration , as a process , must occur through several interrelated steps: wound signaling and healing; production of new cells by proliferation , dedifferentiation or transdifferentiation; specification of cell lineages of the proper type ( s ) and ratio ( s ) ; organization of new cells in three-dimensional space; differentiation of precursors; reestablishment of connections required for functional restoration; and , finally , cessation of regeneration to avoid overgrowth or damage to nearby healthy tissue . Of these steps , production of new CNS cells has been a major focus . The advent of mammalian stem cell-based approaches and advances in cell reprogramming enabled the creation of new , often functional , neurons in vitro ( Wichterle et al . , 2002; Zhang et al . , 2001; Yan et al . , 2005; Han et al . , 2012; Vierbuchen et al . , 2010; Elkabetz and Studer , 2008; Pi\u00f1a-Crespo et al . , 2012; Wernig et al . , 2004 ) . Additionally , the discovery of endogenous stem cell pools in the mammalian brain ( Altman and Das , 1965; Eriksson et al . , 1998 ) raises the possibility of enhancing the brain\u2019s ability to create new neurons from within ( for a review of this progress , see Gage and Temple , 2013 ) . Despite these advances , functional repair in the human CNS remains an extremely ambitious goal and requires the development of new therapies aimed not only at generation of new cells , but also placing and integrating these cells appropriately within a broader regenerative context . To understand how the cell biological processes of regeneration are regulated and coordinated , we look to organisms that successfully regenerate in nature . While some species , like zebrafish and axolotls have a greater regenerative capacity than do mammals , species with the ability to regenerate an entire brain de novo are rare in the animal kingdom and in the realm of established model organisms ( Bely and Nyberg , 2010; Tanaka and Ferretti , 2009; Egger et al . , 2007 ) . Of the small number of animals that regenerate their brains after injury , planarians have emerged as a tractable model system in which to study this remarkable process . Scientists have appreciated the extreme capacity for regeneration found in planarians for over two hundred years ( Elliott and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado , 2013 ) . A nascent brain structure appears soon after amputation ( Cebri\u00e0 et al . , 2002b ) and reproducible brain wiring is indicated by full functional recovery , with resumed movement and feeding after one week ( Inoue et al . , 2004 ) . Anatomical studies have revealed details of the structure and molecular complexity of the planarian central nervous system ( CNS ) , which consists of bi-lobed cephalic ganglia ( the brain ) and two ventral nerve cords ( Figure 1A; Agata et al . , 1998 ) . The planarian brain is composed of a diverse array of neural subtypes that produce conserved neurotransmitters and dozens of neuropeptides ( Nishimura et al . , 2007a , 2007b; 2008a; 2010; 2008b; Collins et al . , 2010 ) . These cell types are regionally organized , with subtypes of cells appearing medially or in lateral structures called brain branches that project toward the margin of the head ( MacRae , 1967; Cebri\u00e0 et al . , 2002a ) . Planarians also regenerate missing brain tissue regardless of the amputation plane or the severity of the injury to the CNS ( Reddien and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado , 2004 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 005 In the past two decades , the introduction of molecular techniques and availability of genomic and transcriptomic data ( Newmark et al . , 2003 , Umesono et al . , 1997; S\u00e1nchez Alvarado and Newmark , 1999; Robb et al . , 2008 ) have enabled great progress in understanding the molecular underpinnings of planarian regeneration . The regenerative ability of planarians depends on a pool of stem cells called neoblasts , at least some of which are pluripotent ( Wagner et al . , 2011 ) . This stem cell pool is heterogeneous ( van Wolfswinkel et al . , 2014; Moritz et al . , 2012; Hayashi et al . , 2010 ) and stem cells respond to injury by migrating , proliferating , and producing daughter cells that differentiate to replace all cell types of the body ( Sal\u00f3 and Bagu\u00f1\u00e0 , 1985; Bagu\u00f1\u00e0 et al . , 1989; Bagu\u00f1\u00e0 , 1976 ) . Additionally , planarians restore their axial polarity after injury; polarity markers reappear early during the regenerative process and are responsible for resetting the body plan ( reviewed in Adell et al . , 2010 ) . Specifically , anterior cues ( including Notum and secreted Frizzled-related proteins ) inhibit posterior Wnt ligands to enable head and brain regeneration ( Petersen and Reddien , 2011 ) . Planarian brain regeneration requires stem cell activity and proper specification of axial polarity , but beyond these generalities , the mechanisms underlying specific regeneration of the brain remain mysterious . Several regulators of planarian brain regeneration were uncovered through candidate-gene approaches , including axon guidance cues like Slit/Robo and Netrin/DCC as well as transcriptional regulators of certain neural subtypes , including Lhx1/5\u20131 , Coe , and others ( Cebri\u00e0 and Newmark , 2005 , 2007; Cebri\u00e0 et al . , 2007; Currie and Pearson , 2013; Cowles et al . , 2013 ) . Despite the identification of these molecules , we know little about the mechanisms that coordinate cell biological events required for regenerative success . We do not yet understand how neoblasts are directed toward particular neural fates or how cells of different neural subtypes become distributed to ensure proper ratios of diverse cell types . Though polarity cues certainly play a key role , we still lack an understanding of how cells within the organism interpret such cues . Furthermore , the signaling molecules that promote regeneration generally and instruct replacement of specific cell types are largely unknown . While muscle cells produce polarity cues during homeostasis and in response to injury ( Wurtzel et al . , 2015; Witchley et al . , 2013 ) , it is not yet clear whether they also produce molecules that promote regeneration , or whether other cells carry out or assist in this key signaling role . Finally , once nascent neural tissue is formed , we do not yet understand how it is patterned , reconnected , and restored to function\u2014especially in the context of pre-existing tissue . To begin answering these important questions , we examined gene expression during the early stages of head regeneration and employed a functional screen to identify key factors in an unbiased manner . We identified several genes required broadly for brain regeneration , including a novel transcriptional regulator of neural progenitors and several putative signaling molecules , some of which are produced by one or more uncharacterized , differentiated cell types in the planarian parenchyma . Furthermore , we identified factors required to promote connectivity and function in specific brain regions . Finally , by investigating genes downregulated during regeneration , we identified a marker that led us to discover a population of cells that we determined to be glia , based on their gene expression and morphology . Taken together , our work uncovered players in diverse aspects of planarian neural regeneration and neurobiology . \n To devise an unbiased list of genes that could promote brain regeneration , we first identified transcripts upregulated during planarian head regrowth . We chose an approach in which we amputated planarians postpharyngeally ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ) , reasoning that this amputation would allow us to identify global gene-expression changes , as well as changes that occur in the regenerating region itself . To identify key time points , we performed several time courses to examine morphological restoration and resumed expression of known brain markers following this particular injury . We examined regenerating animals at 12\u2009hr or 24\u2009hr intervals by immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization ( ISH , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . We confirmed reestablishment of anterior polarity by 12\u2009hr , initial neural gene expression at 36\u2009hr , primordial brain formation after 3 days ( 72\u2009hr ) , and further maturation ( with synapsin staining and broad neural gene expression ) at 5 days post-amputation ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Based on these time courses , we chose 12\u2009hr , 36\u2009hr , and 72\u2009hr as key time points that span the early stages of brain regeneration ( Figure 1B ) . To identify transcripts upregulated during head regeneration , we performed RNA sequencing on regenerating planarians at three time points ( 12 , 36 , and 72\u2009hr ) as well as whole ( non-regenerating ) planarians and planarians immediately after amputation ( \u2018cut\u2019 ) as controls ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Over 900 transcripts were upregulated ( \u22652x , p\u22640 . 01 ) at one or more time points in regenerating animals compared to cut ( 0\u2009hr ) controls that were initially identical to the regenerating animals ( Figure 1C and Supplementary file 1 ) . Furthermore , ~45% of transcripts upregulated vs . cut controls at each time point were also upregulated vs . whole animals ( Figure 1D ) , indicating that differentially expressed genes do not simply reflect a return to homeostatic gene expression . Our data were also subjected to weighted gene correlation network analysis ( Supplementary file 2 ) so that clusters of similarly regulated genes could be identified . Trends for the most abundant clusters of upregulated genes are shown ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A ) ; these modules contain known regulators of neural biology and anterior polarity including coe and lhx1/5\u20131 ( module 6 ) , foxD ( module 7 ) , and notum ( module 8 ) ( Petersen and Reddien , 2008; Gurley et al . , 2008; Petersen and Reddien , 2011; Koinuma et al . , 2003; Cowles et al . , 2013; Currie and Pearson , 2013 ) . We next sought to examine upregulated genes in more detail . Of the genes upregulated compared to cut controls , we eliminated transcripts that were very low abundance , parts of repetitive sequences , or housekeeping genes and cloned 428/933 transcripts for further analyses ( Figure 1E ) . We examined the gene expression patterns of these genes by ISH and were able to establish expression patterns for ~85% of them ( 362/428 ) . We hypothesized that our dataset would be enriched in genes expressed in the CNS and , indeed , found that 47% of genes with clear expression patterns showed enrichment in the CNS ( 170/362 , Figure 1F\u2013G ) . Of the 170 genes with CNS expression , 132 were expressed broadly and 38 showed enrichment in subsets of CNS cells ( Figure 1F\u2013G ) . Additionally , genes expressed in the CNS were often expressed elsewhere , for example in the parenchyma or in the intestine ( Figure 1G ) . Of upregulated genes with detectable expression patterns , we also found that 9% showed enriched expression in the head ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013C ) and 17% were expressed in the parenchyma , some in a pattern similar to neoblast genes ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013E ) . Additional genes were expressed in tissue-specific patterns that included the pharynx , intestine , protonephridia , epithelium , and eyespots ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2F\u2013G ) . Some non-CNS expression patterns could still reflect neural tissue in the pharynx , body wall , or eyes , but we have not investigated neural regeneration outside the CNS at this point . However , the variety of expression patterns reflects the diverse physiological changes that occur concurrently during head regeneration ( Supplementary file 3A ) . To determine whether the upregulated genes promote brain regeneration , we performed RNA interference ( RNAi ) experiments to knock down 326 of the upregulated transcripts ( Figure 2A ) . These genes included all those enriched in the CNS , head , or parenchyma , as well as a subset of genes with other expression patterns or for which no pattern was detected . After RNAi we examined brain regeneration by performing ISH to detect choline acetyltransferase ( ChAT ) mRNA , which is expressed in an abundant cell type in the CNS ( Nishimura et al . , 2010 ) . We validated genes that caused a small brain upon regeneration by repeating RNAi and ISH , this time quantifying brain area after regeneration ( Figure 2B , Supplementary file 3B ) . Of the genes screened , 9 . 2% ( 30/326 ) caused a significant reduction in brain area after RNAi ( Figure 2C ) . A wide range of severity was observed for genes associated with this phenotype , with relative brain areas ranging from 16\u201380% of controls . RNAi targeting two additional genes caused nervous system regeneration phenotypes without a small brain ( Supplementary file 3B ) : sp6-9 ( RNAi ) caused defects in eye regeneration ( Lapan and Reddien , 2011 ) and arrowhead ( RNAi ) caused defects at the midline of the brain which will be described below . If RNAi animals showed gross phenotypes like lysis or curling prior to amputation or regeneration , they were killed and fixed when a phenotype was first observed ( Supplementary file 3C , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 006Figure 2 . A screen for genes required for regeneration of the planarian brain . ( A ) A diagram depicting the RNAi protocol used for our functional screen . For each of the 326 genes analyzed in our study , dsRNA was synthesized and fed to animals three times over 10\u201311 days . Five days after the final dsRNA feeding , animals were cut prepharyngeally and allowed to regenerate for 6 days . The\u00a0animals were then killed and fixed for ISH to visualize the CNS . Animals were also monitored for behavioral defects prior to the termination of the experiment . When animals manifested phenotypes earlier than the conclusion of the experiment ( e . g . , lysis or curling ) , they were fixed when such a phenotype was first observed . ( B ) Example of RNAi animals used for brain area quantification . Control ( RNAi ) and soxB2-2 ( RNAi ) animals were subjected to ISH with the choline acetyltransferase ( ChAT ) probe . After imaging , the body area ( red line ) and brain area ( yellow line ) were calculated for each sample . ( C ) Brain area/body area ratios were averaged across ~8 worms per sample and were normalized to control ( RNAi ) animals .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 008 Genes associated with CNS-regeneration phenotypes were expressed in a variety of patterns , including neural , parenchymal , and ubiquitous expression ( Figures 3\u20134 , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Most were upregulated in the anterior-most tissue in regenerating tail fragments ( Figures 3\u20134 , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) , though patterns ranged from small subsets of cells ( e . g . , AADC , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) to broad upregulation throughout the remaining tissue ( e . g . , tRNA synthase , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . A prior study examined the expression of genes in stem cells and their progeny ( Labb\u00e9 et al . , 2012 ) , and a number of genes identified in our functional screen are also expressed in these cell populations ( Supplementary file 3B ) . Genes with roles in regeneration belonged to several expression modules in our clustering analysis ( Supplementary file 2 and Supplementary file 3B ) with module 7 appearing most frequently ( 7/30 , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . This module includes 600 genes that are modestly upregulated at 12\u2009hr and more dramatically so at 36 and 72\u2009hr post-amputation ( Supplementary file 2 ) . The spatiotemporal diversity of gene expression patterns suggests that these genes likely affect regeneration through multiple mechanisms . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 009Figure 3 . Genes important for brain regeneration exert their effects through multiple mechanisms . ( A ) Expression of soxB2-2 by ISH\u00a0during homeostasis . soxB2-2 cells are scarce , but mostly localized near the brain .

( C ) RNA was prepared from whole control ( RNAi ) and soxB2-2 ( RNAi ) animals at the end of a treatment course depicted in Figure 2A . qPCR was used to examine the expression of 134 genes after RNAi . Selected qPCR results are shown here . The bar graph is color coded to indicate the expression of the gene targeted by RNAi ( black/grey ) , anterior polarity genes ( blue ) , genes important for neurotransmitter biogenesis ( red/pink ) , and genes with suspected roles in neural differentiation or neural progenitors ( dark/light green ) . soxB2-2 was knocked down to 44% of control ( RNAi ) levels after RNAi . Significant decreases in hlh-1 , otxA , and POU2/3-2 were also seen after soxB2-2 ( RNAi ) . Similarly , expression patterns and downstream effects were determined for runt ( D\u2013F ) , hesl-3 ( G\u2013I ) , mblk ( J\u2013L ) , and CRELD ( M\u2013O ) . runt also affected neural progenitor genes , while hesl-3 primarily affected polarity genes . No downregulated genes were identified after mblk ( RNAi ) or CRELD ( RNAi ) . Targets were knocked down to 31% ( runt ) , 34% ( hesl-3 ) , 20% ( mblk ) and 6% ( CRELD ) of control ( RNAi ) levels .

All LDLRR-3+ cells express LDLRR-1 ( 16/16 ) , but only about half of LDLRR-1+cells express LDLRR-3 ( 16/31 ) . LDLRR-3+ cells do not express smedwi-1 ( 0/34 ) , although these cells are often found in proximity to one another . LDLRR-1 , LDLRR-3 , and F-spondin are not expressed in mhc+ muscle cells ( 0/8 , 0/23 , and 0/6 respectively ) . LDLRR FISH experiments were performed on whole worms and F-spondin FISH was performed on 2d regenerating animals . ( D ) The domain architecture of F-spondin .

Parenchymal genes are irradiation-insensitive and do not influence wound response .

( C ) Wound-response genes follistatin , jun , inhibin , and runt were examined by ISH after RNAi and amputation .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 012 As noted above , successful brain regeneration depends on several interrelated processes , not all of which are specific to the CNS . Thus , to distinguish between target genes whose knockdown specifically affected CNS regeneration and those which had indirect effects through other mechanisms , we repeated RNAi experiments and examined effects of each of the 30 genes on anterior polarity , stem cell maintenance , and regeneration of tail tissue . First , we examined the anterior marker sFRP-1 ( Petersen and Reddien , 2008; Gurley et al . , 2008 ) after RNAi of each gene . RNAi knockdown of 5 genes ( argininosuccinate synthase , autophagy-related 13 , smarcb1 , fzd-5/8\u20132 , and hesl-3 ) reduced sFRP-1 expression during regeneration , with reductions ranging from minor to severe ( Figure 2C-blue bars , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Thus , for these five genes , the small brain RNAi phenotype could result from insufficient reestablishment of anterior identity . We also investigated whether the stem cell pool was affected after RNAi knockdown of these 30 genes using the neoblast marker smedwi-1 ( Reddien et al . , 2005 ) . We determined that knockdown of three genes caused a reduction in smedwi-1 signal: snRNPC and rbp-1-like , which have not been described , and the previously identified gene soxP-1 ( Figure 2C-red bars , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C; Wagner et al . , 2012; Wenemoser et al . , 2012 ) . We concluded that RNAi of these three genes led to brain regeneration phenotypes secondary to stem cell defects . Finally , to confirm that brain regeneration phenotypes did not merely result from a general impairment in blastema formation ( i . e . general defects in neoblast proliferation or migration ) , we repeated each RNAi experiment and amputated animals anterior and posterior to the pharynx and subsequently measured blastema size after six days . RNAi of five genes ( tRNA synthase , GTPbp , argininosuccinate synthase , wdr24 , and smarcb1 ) caused smaller blastemas after regeneration and only GTPbp ( RNAi ) had an anterior-specific reduced blastema size ( Supplementary file 3B ) . Thus , these five genes likely play a role in regeneration that is not specific to the CNS ( Figure 2C-gray diagonal lines ) . RNAi of the remaining 19 genes caused no overt polarity or stem cell defects by ISH and no evidence of generally reduced regenerative activity ( Figure 2C-black bars ) . We thus prioritized these genes for further study , as these represent the most promising candidates for factors specifically influencing brain regeneration . Though our current work is focused on regeneration of the planarian CNS , the functional screen we performed resulted in the identification of 26 additional genes for which RNAi caused defects during homeostasis and/or regeneration ( Supplementary file 3C , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . RNAi targeting 12 genes caused head regression and/or curling , while knockdown of 7 genes caused general lysis ( Supplementary file 3C , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . We used ISH with the smedwi-1 probe and detected loss or reduction of neoblasts after knockdown of 13 of these genes ( Supplementary file 3C , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013C ) ; in many of these cases ( e . g . , zfp-4 ) , the causative gene had not been implicated in planarian neoblast biology . As expected , most genes identified in this portion of the screen showed ubiquitous or parenchymal expression patterns ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D ) with enrichment in stem cells and/or stem cell progeny ( Labb\u00e9 et al . , 2012; Supplementary file 3C ) . Other knockdowns ( e . g . , exo70 , hnRNPK , and smarcc2 ) caused tissue homeostasis phenotypes despite the presence of stem cells ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C ) , suggesting potential roles for these genes in proper stem cell function , tissue maintenance , or differentiation . One of these genes ( hnRNPK ) is required for pharynx regeneration ( Adler et al . , 2014 ) and here we show that it is important for head maintenance and regeneration . Therefore , hnRNPK could have a broad role in the\u00a0maintenance or renewal of differentiated cell types . RNAi of one gene , jouberin , also caused bloating reminiscent of protonephridial defects ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . All other genes had no detectable phenotypes in our assays ( Supplementary file 3D ) . We investigated genes important for brain regeneration to determine whether we could assign them to known pathways or processes . To determine which downstream cells or pathways are affected , we repeated RNAi experiments for five genes ( soxB2-2 , runt , hesl-3 , mblk , and CRELD ) and used quantitative RT-PCR ( qPCR ) to examine the expression of ~134 genes after the 6-day regeneration period ( Supplementary file 3E\u2013F ) . The genes chosen for qPCR analysis represent neural markers ( including neuropeptide genes and genes important for neurotransmitter production ) , markers of neural progenitors ( genes expressed in differentiating neoblasts and also associated with neural expression or differentiation ) , and polarity markers . We also included neoblast transcripts and genes expressed in progenitors of other tissues ( protonephridia , intestine , etc . ) to rule out general roles in stem cell maintenance or differentiation ( Supplementary file 3E\u2013F ) . One of the biggest outstanding questions in understanding planarian regeneration is: what molecular cues regulate the process ? Among the 30 genes identified in our functional analysis as being required for proper brain regeneration , several genes ( including CRELD ) encoded putative signaling molecules . Of these genes , a few are expressed in differentiated cells ( Supplementary file 3B; Labb\u00e9 et al . , 2012 ) . One such group of genes is the LDLRR ( low density lipoprotein receptor-related ) family . LDLRR-1 and LDLRR-2 were previously identified in an analysis of wound-response genes ( Wenemoser et al . , 2012 ) . LDLRR-1 is expressed in the parenchyma , while LDLRR-2 is expressed in a subset of intestinal cells and in epithelial cells , particularly in the head ( Figure 4A ) . Both show redistribution of expression after injury , with punctate expression in the blastema during regeneration ( Figure 4A ) . We also identified a gene with similarity to LDLRR-1 in our functional screen , which we have named LDLRR-3; this gene is also expressed in a pattern resembling that of LDLRR-1 ( Figure 4A ) . LDLRR-1 was so named for an LDLR ( Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor ) domain ( Wenemoser et al . , 2012 ) ; however , the current gene model for LDLRR-1 includes a signal peptide sequence but no transmembrane domain , suggesting that LDLRR-1 is likely to be a secreted molecule or to remain attached to the cell surface by other means ( Figure 4B ) . We were unable to detect known domains within the existing LDLRR-2 sequence , but LDLRR-3 has a domain architecture similar to LDLRR-1 and also lacks a transmembrane domain ( Figure 4B ) . Furthermore , LDLRR-1 and LDLRR-3 share closest similarity with proteins of the Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan ( HSPG ) family ( Supplementary file 3G ) . HSPGs play diverse roles in regulation of the extracellular matrix and signaling ( for review , see Lin , 2004 ) . Thus , the planarian family of LDLRR molecules could serve to modulate signaling in a way that promotes regeneration . We asked whether LDLRR-3 is expressed in cell types already known to play key roles during regeneration . LDLRR-3 is not irradiation sensitive ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A; Labb\u00e9 et al . , 2012 ) and we confirmed that LDLRR-3+ cells in the parenchyma are distinct from ( but sometimes adjacent to ) smedwi-1+ stem cells ( Figure 4C ) . Because muscle cells secrete position-control factors that set up the body axis of planarians ( Witchley et al . , 2013 ) , we tested whether LDLRR-3 could be produced by muscle cells . We found that LDLRR-3+cells do not express the muscle marker mhc ( myosin heavy chain; Figure 4C; Kobayashi et al . , 1998 ) ; thus , LDLRR-3 is expressed in differentiated , non-muscle cells to promote regeneration . Furthermore , while LDLRR-1 and LDLRR-3 are expressed in similar patterns ( Figure 4A ) , their expression is only partly overlapping ( Figure 4C ) ; all LDLRR-3+ cells express LDLRR-1 , but only half of LDLRR-1+ cells express LDLRR-3 . As expected based on this finding , LDLRR-1 is also expressed in differentiated , mhc- cells ( Figure 4C; Labb\u00e9 et al . , 2012 ) . Because LDLRR-1 was identified as a wound response gene ( Wenemoser et al . , 2012 ) , we examined other wound response genes ( follistatin , jun , inhibin , and runt ) in LDLRR-1 ( RNAi ) and LDLRR-3 ( RNAi ) animals . We were not able to observe any diminished wound response after these perturbations ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C ) . In addition to the LDLRR family , a gene encoding planarian F-spondin was identified as important for CNS regeneration in our functional screen . F-spondin is also expressed in parenchymal , differentiated cells that are not mhc+ ( Figure 4A , C , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Furthermore , the predicted planarian F-spondin protein possesses a signal peptide but lacks a transmembrane domain ( Figure 4D ) , suggesting that it is secreted , like its homologs in other species ( Feinstein and Klar , 2004 ) . We thus conclude that one or more parenchymal cell types produce cues ( including planarian LDLRR and F-spondin proteins ) that promote regeneration of the CNS and/or regeneration more generally . In addition to exploring genes that are required for brain regeneration , we were interested in examining genes that function in more specific aspects of neural architecture . We hypothesized that regionally expressed genes might affect local connectivity or function in the regenerating planarian CNS . One subset of genes upregulated during regeneration was expressed medially in the planarian brain ( Figure 5A ) . RNAi targeting these genes did not cause small brain phenotypes ( data not shown ) . However , we did detect a specific phenotype after targeting the planarian homolog of arrowhead , a gene that encodes a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor ( Curtiss and Heilig , 1995 , 1997 ) . Planarian arrowhead is expressed in neurons , at least some of which are ChAT+ ( Figure 5A\u2013B ) . Despite normal brain size , arrowhead ( RNAi ) animals regenerated with a gap between the lobes of the cephalic ganglia ( Figure 5C , arrows ) . The medial gap was more clearly visualized with an anti-synapsin antibody that stains the planarian neuropil , a region rich in axons , dendrites , and synapses ( Figure 5D\u2013E ) . The anterior commissure is the largest commissure in the planarian CNS and connects the two lobes of the cephalic ganglia ( Figure 1A ) . Many axons cross the midline at the anterior commissure , including photoreceptor axons ( Agata et al . , 1998 ) . We detected photoreceptor neurons using an anti-arrestin antibody ( VC-1; Agata et al . , 1998 ) and determined that photoreceptor axons appeared frayed and/or failed to cross the midline in a majority of arrowhead ( RNAi ) animals ( Figure 5F\u2013G ) . Failure of photoreceptor axons to cross at the anterior commissure was never detected after control ( RNAi ) ( Figure 5F\u2013G ) . One factor previously shown to regulate axon guidance in planarians is slit ( Cebri\u00e0 et al . , 2007 ) . While some arrowhead+ cells are slit+ , the overall slit expression pattern was unaffected after arrowhead ( RNAi ) ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . Taken together , our results suggest that arrowhead regulates cells or factors that drive reconnection of the planarian brain lobes and organization of newly regenerated axons at the anterior commissure . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 015Figure 5 . arrowhead is required for regeneration of medial structures in the planarian CNS .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 016 As described previously , brain regeneration involves not only the\u00a0production of properly patterned tissue , but also a restoration of function . Planarian brain branches have been ascribed functions in mechanosensing and/or chemosensing ( Oviedo et al . , 2003 , Umesono et al . , 1997 , Nakazawa et al . , 2003 ) and the auricles at the edge of the head of other planarian species have been shown to be important for chemosensory behavior ( Koehler , 1932 , Farnesi and Tei , 1980 ) . The expression of CNG1 , which encodes a cyclic nucleotide-gated ( CNG ) channel , as well as other homologs of olfactory signaling proteins in the brain branches ( Figure 6A ) , supported the hypothesis that these structures mediate functions specific to chemosensing . We observed a particularly interesting expression pattern for CNG1 , which was expressed in regions at the very edge of the head ( Figure 6A\u2013B ) , a location expected for cells serving in a sensory capacity . CNG channels play important signaling roles in the retina and olfactory neurons of other organisms , being activated by cyclic nucleotides ( cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP ) downstream of sensory signaling ( Pifferi et al . , 2006; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C , D ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 017Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 018 Because of the parallels between brain branches and chemosensory organs of other species , we sought to explore the roles of brain branch-expressed genes following regeneration . The 14 brain branch genes ( Figure 6A ) were expressed in a broad variety of patterns , ranging from single rows of cells ( hyp-c47858 and cdc45-like ) to broad expression throughout the brain branches ( DL1 and FLI-1 ) . We detected these transcripts in cells lateral to the neuropil of the cephalic ganglia , in or near cells expressing the classical brain branch marker GluR1 ( Cebri\u00e0 et al . , 2002a; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B and data not shown ) . To understand the function of these genes , we first examined whether the 14 brain branch genes affected regeneration of overall brain branch structure . As mentioned previously , mblk ( RNAi ) affects brain size during regeneration , but the other genes caused no such defect . Brain branches , detected by GluR1 ISH , were also present after knockdown of these 14 genes ( data not shown ) . To test whether brain\u00a0branch-expressed genes promote chemosensory behavior , we repeated all RNAi treatments , this time assaying regenerated worms for their ability to find food in a simple maze ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013H ) . The maze was designed so that planarians had to detect chemicals from their food ( liver paste ) and travel ~45 cm toward the food in order to eat . FLI-1 ( RNAi ) animals consistently showed significantly reduced completion of the maze-based feeding assay , compared to control ( RNAi ) animals ( Figure 6C ) . We confirmed the ability of FLI-1 ( RNAi ) animals to move and to eat food ( without traveling a maze ) to rule out general defects in movement ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1I\u2013J , data not shown ) . FLI-1 encodes an ETS-family transcription factor that is expressed in numerous cells of the planarian brain branches ( Figure 6A , D ) . A minority of FLI-1+ cells express ChAT or GluR1 ( Figure 6E , arrowheads ) , suggesting that the FLI-1+ population likely represents a heterogeneous population of neural cells . Taken together , our findings: i ) support a role for the planarian brain branches in chemosensory behavior and ii ) suggest that FLI-1 is important for regeneration of some aspect of CNS structure or connectivity that restores chemosensory function during regeneration . Furthermore , our analysis of these genes reveals a previously underappreciated complexity to the brain branch structures , which must be reestablished during regeneration . In addition to exploring the genes that are upregulated during regeneration as potential drivers of the process , we also investigated genes downregulated ( \u22652x , p\u22640 . 01 ) after injury as potential inhibitors of regeneration . As proof of principle , we found that the planarian homolog of activin , an inhibitor of regeneration ( Roberts-Galbraith and Newmark , 2013 , Gavino et al . , 2013 ) , is downregulated during regeneration ( Supplementary file 1 ) . We identified 534 downregulated transcripts , with the number of downregulated genes increasing between 12\u2009hr and 72\u2009hr post-amputation ( Figure 7A ) . We were interested in the types of cells that express these downregulated genes , so we cloned 70 genes and determined the expression patterns of 58 by ISH ( Supplementary file 3H ) . The most frequent expression patterns for these genes were in the peripharyngeal secretory cells and the intestine ( 39% and 24% , respectively , Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C ) , suggesting that cell loss or a\u00a0change in the physiology of these organ systems occurs during the early stages of planarian head regeneration . We also detected a number of genes expressed in posterior regions ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D ) , an expected pattern as posterior genes likely need to be downregulated after amputation to permit rescaling of the body axis . Ultimately , we determined that 8/58 genes were expressed in the CNS ( 14% , Figure 7B\u2013C ) . This proportion was about one third that of CNS expression patterns in the upregulated gene dataset . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 019Figure 7 .

( A ) The predominant gene expression patterns of downregulated genes were in the peripharyngeal secretory region ( 20/58 , 34 . 4% ) and gut ( 16/58 , 27 . 6% ) . Secretory expression patterns are shown in ( B ) and intestinal expression patterns are shown in ( C ) . Some genes were also expressed in posterior patterns ( D ) . Scale bars: 500 \u00b5m . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 020 Of the downregulated genes expressed in the planarian CNS , one expression pattern was distinct . Expression of an intermediate filament gene ( IF-1 ) was detected in the CNS in a pattern similar to antibody markers of the neuropil and different than neural gene expression , which typically marks cell bodies around the CNS ( Figure 7C ) . The expression pattern of IF-1 led us to hypothesize that it is expressed in a non-neural subset of cells in the CNS . To test this possibility , we examined whether IF-1 was coexpressed with markers of abundant neural types , including PC-2 and ChAT . Indeed , IF-1 was expressed in cells present in the neuropil that did not express neural markers ( Figure 8A , Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A , data not shown ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 021Figure 8 . Intermediate Filament ( IF-1 ) gene expression marks planarian glial cells .

( B ) slc1a-5 and glutamine synthetase 1 ( GS-1 ) , genes required for glutamate uptake and conversion to glutamine\u00a0are also expressed in an IF-1-like neuropil pattern . ( C ) IF-1 is co-expressed with slc1a-5 and GS-1 ( 46/62 IF-1+ cells were slc1a-5+ and 56/56 IF-1+ cells were GS-1+ ) . IF-1+cells also express the solute carrier genes slc1a-3 ( 33/33 ) , slc2a-1 ( 76/76 ) , slc6a-2 ( 31/35 ) , slc6a-8 ( 48/48 ) and slc7a-8 ( 63/63 ) . Overlap was near perfect for some genes ( all slc7a-8+ cells express IF-1 ) , but other genes are more widely expressed ( only 48/347 slc6a-8+ cells express IF-1 ) . ( D ) Two genes from module 2 ( a downregulated gene cluster ) are also expressed in a neuropil-like pattern . jagged-like is expressed in puncta and a novel gene , estrella , is expressed strongly in the neuropil and in cells around the planarian body . ( E ) IF-1+ cells express jagged-like and estrella ( 48/48 and 61/61 , respectively ) . ( F\u2013G ) FISH with the estrella probe marks cells with extensive cytoplasmic projections in the neuropil , in the periphery of the animal body , near the brain branches , and in the eye , suggesting that estrella+ cells surround many components of the planarian nervous system .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 022 The\u00a0nervous systems of many metazoans contain non-neural support cells that are broadly called glia . The existence of glial cells in planarians has been a matter of debate: electron microscopy analyses have been used to argue both for and against the presence of such cells ( Morita and Best , 1966 , Lentz , 1967 , Bagu\u00f1\u00e0 and Ballester , 1978 , Golubev , 1988 ) . The identification of IF-1+ glia is significant , especially given ( i ) the downregulation of IF-1 as an injury response and ( ii ) the tendency of glial cells in other organisms to affect neural regeneration ( positively or adversely depending on the situation \u2013 for review , see Pekny et al . , 2014 , and for more recent results see Anderson et al . ( 2016 ) ) . IF-1 itself shares some similarity with intermediate filament genes expressed in neurons ( vertebrate neurofilament and C . elegans intermediate filament , ifa-1 ) and glia ( vertebrate glial fibrillary acid protein ) ( Supplementary file 3G ) . Thus , to determine whether the IF-1+ cells of the planarian nervous system share similarities with glial cells in other organisms , we sought to identify genes coexpressed with IF-1 . One frequent function of glial cells is to take up excess neurotransmitters or other chemicals that can be toxic to nearby neurons . For example , astrocytes take up glutamate and convert it to glutamine ( Schousboe et al . , 1977 ) . Glutamate uptake occurs through excitatory amino acid transporters and conversion of glutamate to glutamine is catalyzed by glutamine synthetase ( Rothstein et al . , 1994 , Norenberg and Martinez-Hernandez , 1979 ) . We therefore investigated the expression patterns of planarian slc1a-5 ( solute carrier 1a-5 / EAAT ) and GS-1 ( glutamine synthetase-1 ) and found that they were also expressed in a pattern similar to IF-1 ( Figure 8B ) . Furthermore , we detected IF-1 coexpression with both slc1a-5 and GS-1 ( Figure 8C ) . We also confirmed non-neural expression of slc1a-5 using both PC-2 and ChAT as markers of neurons ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Recently , a comprehensive characterization of solute carrier proteins in S . mediterranea was completed ( Vu et al . , 2015 ) . We assayed the expression patterns of several additional solute carrier\u00a0genes and determined that IF-1+\u00a0cells express slc1a-3 ( an additional glutamate/neutral amino acid transporter ) , slc2a-1 ( a facilitative glutamate transporter ) , slc6a-2 and slc6a-8 ( sodium and chloride-dependent sodium:neurotransmitter transporters ) , and slc7a-8 ( a cationic amino acid transporter ) ( Figure 8C , Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Importantly , many of the genes coexpressed with IF-1 are not differentially expressed ( slc1a-5 and slc6a-2 ) or are even slightly upregulated during regeneration ( slc2a-1 , GS-1 , and slc7a-8 ) . Taken together , these results indicate that IF-1+ glial cells in planarians are similar to glial cells ( and in particular astrocytes ) in other organisms , in that they express a variety of transporters of the solute carrier family ( Cahoy et al . , 2008 ) . Furthermore , because most markers coexpressed with IF-1 are not reduced after amputation , we conclude that glial cells are not lost after injury , but instead alter their gene expression . We also sought an unbiased way of identifying genes coexpressed with IF-1 , particularly additional genes downregulated during head regeneration . Reasoning that genes that behave like IF-1 during regeneration might meet both criteria , we turned to our clustering analysis , and focused on\u00a0module 2 , a cluster of 1520 genes ( including IF-1 ) that are downregulated by 12\u00a0hr post-amputation and even more significantly downregulated at 36\u00a0hr and 72\u00a0hr ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013E ) . As a pilot study , we cloned 48 genes from this module and examined their expression patterns . The majority of these genes showed expression patterns irrelevant to our glial studies . However , two transcripts were expressed in IF-1+cells ( Figure 8D\u2013E ) . jagged-like encodes a protein with weak similarity to Jagged that contains a signal peptide , two EGF domains , and a\u00a0transmembrane domain . We also identified a gene that encodes a signal peptide-containing protein; we named this novel gene estrella ( 'star' in Catalan ) based on its expression pattern and the origin of our S . mediterranea strain in Barcelona . The expression pattern of estrella highlights the extensive processes of glial cells and their wide distribution in the neuropil , the peripheral nervous system , near the brain branches , and near photoreceptors ( Figure 8F\u2013G; Cowles et al . , 2014 ) . Together , our results indicate that IF-1+ glial cells respond to injury by downregulating a variety of genes ( including genes that encode potential signaling molecules ) over the course of several days . Finally , we used electron microscopy to confirm the existence of glial cells in the planarian neuropil . Indeed , we detected cells in the neuropil that had numerous fine cellular processes that intermingled with axons ( Figure 8H\u2013I , Video 3\u20134 ) . Planarian glial cells were also distinct from nearby neurons in that they had electron-dense cytoplasm and elongated nuclei with abundant peripheral heterochromatin ( Figure 8H ) . Throughout the neuropil , where neuronal processes are a dominant feature , electron-dense projections were also common ( Video 5 ) , suggesting extensive projection of glial cells throughout the neuropil of the planarian nervous system . Though we have not yet shown that the cells identified by electron microscopy are IF-1+ , the morphology seen by electron microscopy is consistent with the cell shapes revealed by estrella gene expression ( Figure 8F\u2013G ) . We therefore conclude that both our gene expression data and electron microscopic analysis support the existence of glia in the planarian CNS . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 023Video 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17002 . 025 \n To better understand regeneration , it will be important to identify the signals that initiate and direct the process . Some signals , from small molecules to proteins , have been identified in other regenerative model organisms ( e . g . , Wnt3 in Hydra , H2O2 and cysteinyl leukotriene in zebrafish , a MARCKS-like protein in axolotl , and newt anterior gradient protein; Chera et al . , 2009 , Kyritsis et al . , 2012 , Niethammer et al . , 2009 , Kumar et al . , 2007 , Sugiura et al . , 2016 ) . Surprisingly , the signals that promote regeneration in planarians remain mysterious . Notwithstanding a host of signaling molecules known to establish polarity in the regenerating worm , only a few signaling molecules or their receptors have been determined to regulate regeneration , including opposing Follistatin and Activin signals and EGF- and FGF-receptors that regulate various aspects of homeostasis and regeneration ( Roberts-Galbraith and Newmark , 2013 , Gavino et al . , 2013 , Fraguas et al . , 2011 , Ogawa et al . , 2002 , Wagner et al . , 2012 , Lei et al . , 2016 ) . Importantly , though planarian neoblasts have been hypothesized to integrate a wide variety of signals to choose between daughter cell fates ( Reddien , 2013 ) , whether neoblasts express the diversity of receptors required to integrate numerous signals remains unknown . Neoblasts do express FGF-receptors that are important for tissue maintenance ( Ogawa et al . , 2002 , Wagner et al . , 2012 ) , but no ligands for these receptors have been identified through homology searches . Thus , further exploring the signals required for regeneration , as well as the cellular origin ( s ) and receiver ( s ) of each signal will greatly enhance our understanding of how diverse cellular events ( i . e . , proliferation , migration , organization , differentiation ) are triggered and coordinated during the regenerative response . One goal of our screen was to identify putative signals that influence regeneration , generally , or for the CNS in particular . To that end , we identified several putative signaling molecules encoded by CRELD , F-spondin , and LDLRR family genes that each encode a secreted or transmembrane protein that could function in a signaling capacity . CRELD genes are conserved among metazoans but are not very well characterized . Two CRELD homologs exist in mammals . CRELD1 serves an essential function during mouse heart development and encodes a protein reported to have two transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic EGF-like domain ( Mass et al . , 2014 ) . Conversely , CRELD2 encodes a secreted protein ( Oh-hashi et al . , 2011 ) . In mice , CRELD1 is expressed in the CNS in addition to its expression in the heart , and the Drosophila CRELD homolog ( CG11377 ) is expressed across multiple tissues , including the nervous system ( Mass et al . , 2014; Brown et al . , 2014 ) . Planarian CRELD is expressed in diverse cell types ( Wurtzel et al . , 2015 ) , including stem cell progeny ( Labb\u00e9 et al . , 2012 ) , and is enriched in the brain and head . Smed-CRELD has two predicted isoforms ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E; Brandl et al . , 2016 ) that encode a transmembrane protein and a secreted protein , each with extracellular EGF-like domains . Further studies will be required to determine how CRELD exerts its function in the regenerating head and to what extent this function might be conserved . Other signaling molecules identified in our study include homologs of matrix-associated proteins . F-spondin proteins are conserved among metazoans , localize to ECM-rich areas , and play roles in cell adhesion , including promoting axon extension from the neural floor plate ( Klar et al . , 1992; Umemiya et al . , 1997; Burstyn-Cohen et al . , 1998; Burstyn-Cohen et al . , 1999; Woo et al . , 2008 ) . Despite their names , planarian LDLRR proteins are most closely related to basement membrane-specific Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans ( HSPGs ) in other metazoans . In other organisms , HSPGs are also ECM components and modulate signaling of many ligands , including Wnt , Hedgehog , and FGF ( Tsuda et al . , 1999; Reichsman et al . , 1996; The et al . , 1999; Kiefer et al . , 1990 ) . F-spondin and the LDLRR proteins are predicted to be secreted molecules and could promote regeneration by serving as signals themselves , by binding to and changing the activity of other signaling molecules , and/or by contributing to an unknown regenerative function of the planarian ECM . Importantly , F-spondin , LDLRR-1 , and -3 are each expressed in differentiated , non-muscle cells in the parenchyma , suggesting that these uncharacterized cells perform some signaling function important for proper regeneration . Cells expressing LDLRR-3 and F-Spondin clustered with 'gut' cells in a recent transcriptomic analysis of single cells ( Wurtzel et al . , 2015 ) , but the overall expression patterns of these genes are not reflective of the intestine . Thus , further work will be required to identify and characterize these cells . Planarian stem cells are present throughout the parenchyma and are surrounded by other parenchymal cell types , one of which has been termed 'fixed parenchyma cells' in the electron microscopy literature ( Pedersen , 1961 ) . We have yet to determine what kind of cell-cell interactions or local signaling events in the parenchyma influence the activity of planarian stem cells , either in homeostasis or in regeneration . The parenchymal signaling cells and molecules revealed by our screen might be a valuable entry point in determining whether or how neighboring cells promote the maintenance , cycling , differentiation , or migration of planarian neoblasts . Another area of investigation concerns whether the CNS influences regeneration by playing a signaling role , as it does in other organisms ( Kumar and Brockes , 2012 ) . A recent single-cell analysis suggested that neurons do not respond to injury with gene expression changes ( Wurtzel et al . , 2015 ) . However , these studies were performed on worm fragments that were missing their cephalic ganglia , and only addressed gene expression changes in the first 12\u2009hr after amputation . We identified one gene upregulated later in regeneration , arrowhead , that is required at the midline of the cephalic ganglia for axon organization across the anterior commissure . This non-cell-autonomous role likely involves signaling from arrowhead+ neurons at this location to organize the projections of other cells , including the photoreceptor neurons . Our preliminary finding that some arrowhead+ cells express slit offers one clue about how this might occur , but a deeper investigation of Arrowhead targets will distinguish between this and other possibilities . Thus , at a minimum , some neurons of the CNS likely influence the organization of one another during regeneration . Further work will be required to identify the molecules that govern this influence and to study other contributions of the CNS to the signaling environment required for a proper regenerative response . One of the crucial events required for regeneration of nervous tissue is coordinated neurogenesis . In the planarian field , a major question is how neoblasts are directed to specific cell fates , including neurons , and how the appropriate number and mixture of cells are reestablished . In planarians , some work has been done to identify a handful of factors that regulate commitment to certain neural subtypes , including coe , lhx1/5\u20131 , and others ( Currie and Pearson , 2013; Cowles et al . , 2013; Scimone et al . , 2014 ) . Additionally , a new category of specialized neoblast has recently been proposed to contribute to neural fates ( Molinaro and Pearson , 2016 ) . However , we lack a fundamental understanding of the basic neurogenesis program ( s ) in planarians . It is not yet clear whether neoblasts commit to specific neural fates in one step or through a series of binary choices . Additionally , we do not know how or whether these fate choices are reoriented in response to injury . In our screen , we expected to identify factors that could play roles in neural cell fate decisions . We identified a transcription factor , soxB2-2 , required for full expression of several neural progenitor genes . Importantly , soxB2-2 ( RNAi ) animals display behavioral phenotypes ( decreased sensitivity to vibrations ) and regenerate brains smaller than those resulting from many other perturbations . These observations suggest that soxB2-2 likely regulates gene expression even more broadly than we have so far observed . The homolog of soxB2-2 is expressed during embryonic development of Schmidtea polychroa ( Monjo and Romero , 2015 ) . Related Sox family members sox14 and sox21 play roles in the\u00a0neurobiology of diverse animal species ( Hargrave et al . , 2000 , Kirilly et al . , 2009 , Sandberg et al . , 2005 , Richards and Rentzsch , 2015 ) . In particular , sox21 is upregulated during spinal cord regeneration in Xenopus ( Lee-Liu et al . , 2014 ) . It will be important to determine whether roles for soxB2-2 in neurogenesis and regeneration are indeed conserved . We also expanded the known roles for planarian runt in brain regeneration . runt is expressed in response to different injuries in planarians ( Wenemoser et al . , 2012 , Sandmann et al . , 2011 ) and modulates factors , including sp6-9 and ovo , that are essential for eye development ( Figure 3F; Sandmann et al . , 2011 , Wenemoser et al . , 2012 , Lapan and Reddien , 2011 , Lapan and Reddien , 2012 ) . In addition to its role in the eye , runt is important for proper expression of ap2 and klf ( Figure 3F; Wenemoser et al . , 2012 ) ; ap2 drives respecification of medial TrpA+ neurons , and klf is important for regeneration of cintillo+ cells in the brain branches ( Wenemoser et al . , 2012 , Scimone et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , runt influences neural progenitors to contribute to multiple neural types across different regions of the brain . Neither soxB2-2 nor runt appears to be required globally for neurogenesis , but each controls a distinct array of fates and is required for optimal brain regeneration , suggesting that these two genes\u2019 products promote distinct neurogenesis pathways . Both soxB2-2 and runt are upregulated during regeneration , implying that they are activated in neoblasts or early progenitors to skew the balance of specialized progeny and promote neural fates needed for rebuilding the brain . Future studies could use soxB2-2 and runt as starting points for defining neurogenesis pathways; by exploring both upstream regulators and targets that control downstream progenitor and neural fates , these middle-out studies could define differentiation trajectories from neoblast to neuron . Dozens of neural cell types in the planarian CNS can be defined by the expression patterns of neuropeptide and neurotransmitter biosynthesis genes ( Nishimura et al . , 2007a , 2007b , 2008a , 2010 , 2008b , Collins et al . , 2010 ) . Most of these neural subtypes arise during regeneration through mechanisms that have not yet been uncovered . Exceptions include the specification of serotonergic neurons by lhx1/5\u20131 and pitx ( Currie and Pearson , 2013 , Marz et al . , 2013 ) and the specification of dopamine \u00df-hydroxylase+ neurons by pax3/7 ( Scimone et al . , 2014 ) . In our study , RNAi knockdown of runt failed to significantly influence any of the specific markers of differentiated neurons that we tested in this analysis ( e . g . , ChAT to mark cholinergic neurons ) . Although knockdown of soxB2-2 decreased several markers , only tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) dropped past the threshold of statistical significance ( Figure 3C ) . That RNAi would affect presumptive neural progenitors without a detectable effect on a neural marker could simply be due to a lack of tools required to delineate the affected neural cell types , or due to the sensitivity of the assay . However , other transcription factors identified in this screen as having no brain-size phenotype ( e . g . , glass ) could play more subtle roles in specification or function of neural subtypes . FLI-1 expression in neoblasts could shift them to certain fates important for brain-branch architecture or wiring . In contrast , transcription factors like arrowhead and mblk are each expressed predominantly in differentiated cell types ( Labb\u00e9 et al . , 2012 ) , and likely function later in differentiation or in mature neurons to affect maintenance , connectivity , or function . Along these lines , a homolog of mblk in C . elegans is important for neurite pruning ( Kage et al . , 2005 ) . Surprisingly , though we anticipated that hesl-3 would affect gene expression in neural progenitors ( Cowles et al . , 2013 ) , we found that the clearest impact of hesl-3 ( RNAi ) is on polarity genes like sFRP and foxD . hesl-3 expression is highest in neoblasts ( Cowles et al . , 2013 , Labb\u00e9 et al . , 2012 ) , though expression in the CNS is also evident ( Figure 3G; Cowles et al . , 2013 ) . However , no expression at the anterior tip is visible . One straightforward model for the function of hesl-3 would be that it is required for specification of muscle cells that eventually contribute to the anterior pole . Another possibility is that hesl-3+ cells contribute to regeneration of the brain and that the regenerating brain is important for resetting or maintaining anterior polarity . Neural tissue is critical for regeneration in a variety of other model organisms ( Kumar and Brockes , 2012 ) , but we have not been able to determine whether it is so in planarians . Future work will be required to identify targets of hesl-3 and to determine whether its roles in head patterning and brain regeneration occur through an influence on neurogenesis , polarity , or both . Glia exist across animal phyla and play diverse , crucial roles in supporting the differentiation , survival , and function of neurons . We investigated genes downregulated during planarian regeneration and discovered a marker ( Intermediate Filament-1 ) that is expressed in non-neural cells that have several hallmarks of glial identity . First , IF-1+ cells express a range of solute carrier family genes , including genes that are important for reuptake of glutamate; this function is carried out by astrocytes in the mammalian nervous system ( Schousboe et al . , 1977 , Norenberg and Martinez-Hernandez , 1979 ) . Second , IF-1+ cells are present in the neuropil and have extensive cytoplasmic projections , positioning them ideally to support axonal or synaptic activity of neurons in the CNS . Third , IF-1+ cells respond to injury by changing their gene expression ( downregulating IF-1 , jagged-like , and estrella ) , much like astrocytes in mammals ( for reviews , Sofroniew , 2009 , Pekny and Nilsson , 2005 ) . The discovery of glia in the planarian CNS raises many interesting possibilities for future study . Glia are an abundant , diverse , and essential population of cells in the mammalian nervous system , so functional regeneration of human neural tissue would require regeneration of glia alongside regeneration of neurons themselves . Thus , it will be informative to understand how glia repopulate the regenerating planarian CNS and in particular how glial and neural regeneration are coordinated . Additionally , activation of astrocytes in the mammalian nervous system protects tissue after injury but also contributes to glial scarring that can promote or prohibit axonal regrowth or functional recovery ( Pekny et al . , 2014 , Anderson et al . , 2016 ) . Though it is not yet clear whether the planarian glial injury-response program is important for driving or permitting regeneration , contrasting the planarian glial response with that of glia in non-regenerating organisms might shed light on how glial activation can be harnessed for purely regeneration-promoting functions . For example , planarian IF-1 is downregulated after injury , while mammalian GFAP is upregulated during astrocyte activation ( Condorelli et al . , 1990 ) . Finally , RNAi of the glial genes identified in this study has so far failed to reveal phenotypes ( data not shown ) . This is not surprising , because the downregulation of IF-1 and other glial genes during regeneration suggests that gain-of-function treatments might be more likely to perturb regeneration . More nuanced assays and identification of genes required for glial specification or maintenance will be required to assess whether and how planarian glia support neuronal biology and behavior in planarians . Planarians regenerate their central nervous system de novo , prodigiously replacing neurons and reconnecting neural networks to restore function in only a week . As such , they provide a simple , in vivo model for understanding neural regeneration . In this study , we used a transcriptomic approach to guide an unbiased functional screen . Through RNAi studies , we identified several factors that influence reestablishment of cell types , reconnection of a major commissure , and restoration of chemosensory behavior . Genes identified in our study also mark new cell types , including planarian glia , putative chemosensory cells , and previously unknown parenchymal cells that promote regeneration . In sum , we have advanced our understanding of diverse aspects of planarian neurobiology and neural regeneration; furthermore , we have laid the foundation for a wide range of studies geared toward understanding success and failure in neural regeneration . \n Planarians from an asexual , clonal line ( Schmidtea mediterranea , CIW4; S\u00e1nchez Alvarado et al . , 2002 ) were maintained at 21\u00baC in ultrapure water with 0 . 5\u2009g/L Instant Ocean salts ( Spectrum Brands , Blacksburg , VA ) . Regeneration experiments were completed in the presence of 50 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin ( Gemini Bio-Products , West Sacramento , CA ) . Animals were stored in unsealed Ziploc containers or 60\u2009mm petri dishes . For regeneration experiments , animals were amputated using sterile scalpels . Animals were between 2\u20135\u2009mm for all experiments unless otherwise noted and were starved for at least one week prior to use . For stem cell ablation , animals were irradiated with 60 gray at 150 kV , 5 mA on the top shelf of a Gammacell-220 with a cobalt-60 source ( Nordion , Ottawa , ON , Canada ) . Large worms ( ~1 cm ) were used for transcriptomic studies . Animals were amputated post-pharyngeally and were allowed to regenerate for 12 , 36 , or 72\u2009hr . Whole animals and animals killed immediately after amputation were used for two separate controls . Either 10 whole animals or 30 tail pieces were used per condition , in triplicate . Planarians were killed in TRIzol reagent ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) and samples were frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00baC until RNA purification was completed as per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol . After purification , RNA was DNase-treated ( Promega , Madison , WI ) and column purified ( Zymo Research , Irvine , CA ) . RNA samples were submitted to the W . M . Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics ( UIUC ) for quality analysis using a bioanalyzer ( Agilent , La Jolla , CA ) and subsequent library construction and sequencing ( Illumina , San Diego , CA ) . Sequencing depth was 13 . 5\u201340 . 1 million reads ( 100 nt ) per sample , for a total of 325 . 5 million reads across all conditions . All Illumina sequencing was deposited in the Sequence Reads Archive as study PRJNA319973 . Initially , reads were mapped via RNA-Seq ( Marioni et al . , 2008 ) in the CLC genomics workbench ( QIAgen , Hilden , Germany ) to a previously generated transcriptome ( Rouhana et al . , 2012; available online at www . ideals . illinois . edu/handle/2142/28689 and within the PlanMine database ( Brandl et al . , 2016 ) , planmine . mpi-cbg . de ) . RPKM ( reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads ) values were calculated and compared using the CLC suite , with p values calculated for each pair of samples using two-sided , unpaired T-tests with Bonferroni correction ( Supplementary file 1 ) . From this analysis , contigs \u2265two-fold upregulated or downregulated ( p\u22640 . 01 ) were pursued for initial functional analysis . In parallel , raw reads for each contig were input into R 3 . 1 . 1 ( R Core Team , 2013 ) for data pre-processing and statistical analysis using packages from Bioconductor ( Gentleman et al . , 2004 ) as below . After trimmed mean of M-values normalization ( Robinson and Oshlack , 2010 ) and filtering of low abundance transcripts ( <0 . 5 counts per million were discarded ) , the remaining 31 , 862 ( of 55 , 949 ) contigs were analyzed using edgeR v 3 . 6 . 8 ( Robinson et al . , 2010 ) . A one-way ANOVA was calculated across the five groups for each contig using a quasi-likelihood negative binomial generalized log-linear model ( Lund et al . , 2012 ) with robust estimation of the sample variances . Multiple hypothesis test correction was completed using the False Discovery Rate ( FDR ) method ( Benjamini and Hochberg , 1995 ) . To examine global gene expression patterns across the dataset , we selected 9 , 850 contigs with one-way ANOVA FDR p-value \u22640 . 1 for weighted gene correlation network analysis ( WGCNA ) ( Zhang and Horvath , 2005 , Langfelder and Horvath , 2008 ) . We performed WGCNA ( v 1 . 41\u20131 ) using the default values of the blockwiseModules ( ) function except for: soft thresholding power beta = 2- , TOMType = \u201csigned , \u201d a minimum module size of 20 , and merging similar modules at 0 . 15; this approach yielded 40 modules , each with genes that share similar expression dynamics across the time course . An eigengene value was computed for each sample from the first principal component score of the expression values of the contigs in the module . For each gene of interest , a 300\u20131000 bp fragment was cloned from cDNA into pJC53 . 2 , a vector designed to allow TA-cloning and subsequent production of riboprobes or dsRNA ( Collins et al . , 2010 ) , using standard molecular biological methods . Riboprobes and dsRNA were synthesized as previously described ( Collins et al . , 2010 , Rouhana et al . , 2013 ) . For all RNAi experiments , dsRNA matching GFP or bacterial ccdB genes was used for negative controls . Riboprobes were synthesized with digoxigenin-12-UTP ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) or dinitrophenol-11-UTP ( Perkin Elmer , Waltham , MA ) . Quantitative PCR experiments were performed as previously described ( Miller and Newmark , 2012 ) . Briefly , RNA was purified as described above and cDNA was synthesized using an iScript kit ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . qPCR was performed using GoTaq Mastermix ( Promega ) on a StepOnePlus real-time PCR machine and software ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) . \u00df-tubulin was used as a normalization control and qPCR primers are listed in Supplementary file 3E . Initial qPCR experiments were performed 2\u20134 times per gene knockdown; validation qPCR experiments ( Figure 3 ) were performed in biological triplicate and technical triplicate , except soxB2-2 ( RNAi ) and control , for which we had 6 biological replicates and technical triplicates . p values were calculated by t test in Prism ( GraphPad , La Jolla , CA ) . Sequence analysis was performed to detect protein domains ( pFam 29 . 0; Finn et al . , 2016 ) , transmembrane domains ( TMHMM 2 . 0; Krogh et al . , 2001 ) , and signal peptides ( SignalP 4 . 1; Petersen et al . , 2011 ) . Sequences for genes identified in this analysis have been deposited at Genbank . Colorimetric in situ hybridization ( ISH ) experiments were done as per Pearson et al . ( 2009 ) , but with the following changes described in King and Newmark ( 2013 ) : the reduction step was eliminated; animals were bleached in a formamide-containing solution for 2 . 5\u20133\u2009hr under light; and proteinase K was used at a concentration of 5 \u00b5g/mL ( for regenerating worms ) or 10 \u00b5g/mL ( whole animals ) . For colorimetric ISH , Digoxigenin-containing probes were used in combination with an anti-DIG-AP antibody ( 1:2000 , Roche ) . Fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) was performed as above , but with the following changes: digoxigenin- and/or dinitrophenol-containing probes were used; riboprobes were detected by anti-digoxigenin-POD ( 1:2000 , Roche ) or anti-dinitrophenol-HRP ( 1:300 , Perkin Elmer ) ; the blocking solution was TNTx ( 100\u2009mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 150\u2009mM NaCl , 0 . 3% Triton X-100 ) with 5% horse serum and 0 . 5% Roche western blocking reagent ( Roche ) ; and TNTx was also used for post-antibody washes . For FISH , tyramide conjugates were synthesized and signal amplification reactions were performed as described ( King and Newmark , 2013 ) . Immunofluorescence experiments were performed as described ( Roberts-Galbraith and Newmark , 2013 ) . The following primary antibodies were used: anti-phospho-histone H3 ( 1:5000 , S10; Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA ) , anti-synapsin ( 1:100 , 3C11 concentrate; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , Iowa City , IA ) , and anti-arrestin ( 1:10000 , VC1; kindly provided by Kiyokazu Agata ) . Secondary antibodies ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) were used at a dilution of 1:800 ( goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 ) or 1:2500 ( goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 ) . Animals ( 10\u201312 ) were placed in a 60\u2009mm petri dish in salts and were fed 3 \u00b5g dsRNA in 30 \u00b5L of a liver puree:salts mixture ( 3:1 , tinted with green food coloring ) . RNAi experiments are diagrammed in Figure 2A and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1H . Briefly , animals were fed three times over the course of 10\u201311 days , amputated prepharyngeally 5 days after the last feeding , and allowed to regenerate for 6\u2009hr ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C ) , 6 days ( for all other in situ\u00a0or immunofluorescence experiments ) , or 10 days ( behavioral assays ) . For all experiments , animals were observed for obvious behavioral or physiological defects before they were fixed or otherwise assayed . To assay blastema size , animals were fixed after regeneration for imaging . Mazes were constructed at the Life Sciences Machine Shop ( University of Illinois ) out of clear and black acrylic sheets according to the measurements shown ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013F ) . Prior to a behavioral experiment , we added 70\u2009mL salts to each maze and pipetted 60 \u00b5L of a liver puree:salts mixture ( 3:1 , tinted green ) into the far side of the maze as shown ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1G ) . The mazes were incubated at room temperature for fifteen minutes . RNAi-treated , regenerated animals ( 10\u201312 per replicate ) were placed in the maze in the position shown ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1G ) . Mazes were covered to allow complete darkness and animals were permitted 1\u2009hr to complete the maze and eat . Animals that had eaten were scored based on the presence of green in their intestines . Experiments were performed in biological triplicate and differences between the samples were evaluated using a Chi-squared test . In a separate experiment , control and FLI-1 ( RNAi ) animals were added to the center of 60\u2009mm petri dishes on a sheet with concentric circles ( the smallest of which was 1 . 5 cm in diameter ) . After 15 min , animals were scored for their ability to move beyond the starting circle . A Chi-squared test was also used to evaluate the difference between these samples . We used a Leica M205A stereomicroscope to image animals live or after colorimetric ISH . Images were captured using LAS 3 . 6 . 0 software ( Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) . We quantified brain area and blastema size in ImageJ ( Schneider et al . , 2012 ) . Areas were averaged across a condition and were compared to control using a one-way ANOVA . Fluorescence images ( immunofluorescence and FISH ) were captured using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope and either a 20X ( Plan-Apochromat 206/0 . 8 ) or a 63X objective ( Plan-Apochromat 636/1 . 4 ) . Zen software ( Carl Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) was used for these experiments . We fixed and processed planarians for transmission electron microscopy as described in Brubacher et al . , 2014 . Serial 70 nm sections were cut on a Leica Ultracut S ultramicrotome , and collected on formvar- and carbon-coated copper slot grids ( Ted Pella , Redding , CA ) and stained with lead citrate for 2\u2009min at room temperature ( Venable and Coggeshall , 1965 ) . We imaged the trunk ventral nerve cord using a Hitachi H-7000 STEM at 75 kV , equipped with an AMT 1600\u2009M CCD camera ( Hitachi , Tokyo , Japan ) . IMOD software version 4 . 3 . 7 ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) was used to stack and align images , and to segment and mesh digital models . Image processing and animations were conducted with Adobe Photoshop CS5 software ( Adobe Systems , San Jose , CA ) ."}
{"headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["biochemistry and chemical biology", "neuroscience"], "id": "elife-57544-v2", "summary": "Biologists often refer to a small molecule called adenosine triphosphate \u2013 or ATP for short \u2013 as \u2018the currency of life\u2019 . This molecule carries energy all through the body , and most cells and proteins require ATP to perform their various roles . Nerve cells ( also known as neurons ) in the brain release ATP when activated , and use this molecule to send signals to other active neurons or other cells in the brain . But ATP can also signal danger in the brain . A molecule derived from ATP is involved in transmitting the pain signals of migraines and severe headaches; and ATP levels can become imbalanced after strokes , when parts of the brain are deprived of blood . Despite its importance , ATP remains difficult to visualize in the body , and monitoring the molecule in the active brain in real time is challenging . To address this issue , Kitajima et al . designed an optical sensor that could monitor ATP in the healthy brain , and was sensitive enough to detect when and where it was released . First , Kitajima et al . made several potential sensors by attaching various fluorescent tags to different locations on a protein that binds ATP . Next each sensor was tested to determine whether it could bind ATP tightly and get bright upon binding . This is important because previous sensors could not detect ATP release in the brains of living animals . To illustrate the new sensors\u2019 potential , Kitajima et al . used the sensor to image ATP in the brains of live mice . A \u2018wave\u2019 of ATP was seen spreading through the brain after neurons were stimulated with a small electric pulse , mimicking a sudden migraine or stroke . The results confirm that this new sensor is suitable for imaging how ATP signals in the brain , and it may help resolve the underlying mechanisms of migraines and strokes . This sensor could also be used to understand other cellular process which rely on ATP to carry out their role .", "source": "Adenosine 5\u2019 triphosphate ( ATP ) is a ubiquitous extracellular signaling messenger . Here , we describe a method for in-vivo imaging of extracellular ATP with high spatiotemporal resolution . We prepared a comprehensive set of cysteine-substitution mutants of ATP-binding protein , Bacillus FoF1-ATP synthase \u03b5 subunit , labeled with small-molecule fluorophores at the introduced cysteine residue . Screening revealed that the Cy3-labeled glutamine-105 mutant ( Q105C-Cy3; designated ATPOS ) shows a large fluorescence change in the presence of ATP , with submicromolar affinity , pH-independence , and high selectivity for ATP over ATP metabolites and other nucleotides . To enable in-vivo validation , we introduced BoNT/C-Hc for binding to neuronal plasma membrane and Alexa Fluor 488 for ratiometric measurement . The resulting ATPOS complex binds to neurons in cerebral cortex of living mice , and clearly visualized a concentrically propagating wave of extracellular ATP release in response to electrical stimulation . ATPOS should be useful to probe the extracellular ATP dynamics of diverse biological processes in vivo . \n Adenosine 5\u2019 triphosphate ( ATP ) is the essential energy currency of intracellular metabolism of all living systems , but also plays important roles as an extracellular signaling molecule in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes , including neurotransmission ( Burnstock , 2007 ) , neuron\u2013glia signaling ( Fields and Burnstock , 2006; Khakh and North , 2012 ) , tissue circulation ( Cheng et al . , 2018; Gonz\u00e1lez-Alonso et al . , 2002; MacVicar and Newman , 2015 ) , regulation of the immune system ( Idzko et al . , 2014; Junger , 2011 ) , and cancer development ( Di Virgilio et al . , 2018; Stagg and Smyth , 2010 ) . In order to elucidate the mechanisms of these processes , an understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of ATP is essential . To date , a variety of techniques for measurement of ATP have been developed: bioluminescence assay methods using firefly luciferase ( Holton , 1959; Pellegatti et al . , 2005; Wang et al . , 2000 ) , electrochemical methods including voltammetry ( Singhal and Kuhr , 1997 ) , enzyme-coupled electrode techniques ( Kueng et al . , 2004; Llaudet et al . , 2005 ) , cell-based electrophysiological techniques ( Brown and Dale , 2002; Pangrsic et al . , 2007 ) , and whole cell-based fluorescence assay methods using Ca2+ indicator ( Anselmi et al . , 2008; Huang et al . , 2007 ) . Some of them have been applied to measure extracellular ATP concentrations in vivo ( Gourine et al . , 2005; Melani et al . , 2005; Pellegatti et al . , 2008 ) . For example , bioluminescence assay is able to quantify the extracellular ATP levels in microdialysis samples ( Melani et al . , 2005 ) , and enzyme-coated electrodes inserted in tissues allow continuous monitoring of extracellular ATP levels in the brain ( Gourine et al . , 2005 ) . However , these methods do not provide spatial information . Imaging of the bioluminescence generated by luciferin-luciferase reaction might be a solution for spatially resolved measurement of ATP ( Rajendran et al . , 2016 ) , and indeed , engineered cells displaying luciferase on the plasma membrane were used to visualize extracellular ATP in vivo by inoculating the cells into living mice ( Pellegatti et al . , 2008 ) . However , both spatial resolution and temporal resolution in luciferase-based imaging are inherently compromised by the low photon flux of bioluminescence emission ( Rajendran et al . , 2016 ) . On the other hand , imaging techniques using fluorescent sensors can provide excellent spatiotemporal resolution ( Giepmans et al . , 2006 ) , and a variety of fluorescent ATP sensors based on fluorescent proteins have been developed ( Arai et al . , 2018; Berg et al . , 2009; Imamura et al . , 2009; Lobas et al . , 2019; Tantama et al . , 2013; Yaginuma et al . , 2015 ) . These genetically encoded ATP sensors can visualize intracellular ATP dynamics , and have facilitated our understanding of ATP signaling inside cells ( Depaoli et al . , 2018; Zala et al . , 2013 ) . In contrast , attempts to adapt the existing sensors for extracellular use have achieved limited success , and in vivo imaging of extracellular ATP is still difficult ( Conley et al . , 2017; Lobas et al . , 2019 ) . One problem is that the affinities of these extracellular ATP sensors are too low to monitor extracellular ATP , the concentration of which likely ranges from hundreds of nanomolar to micromolar levels ( Yegutkin , 2008 ) . Moreover , these extracellular ATP sensors are designed to be synthesized inside the cells and transported to the plasma membrane to face the extracellular space ( Conley et al . , 2017; Lobas et al . , 2019 ) . Imperfect membrane transport as well as potential posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation during this process can compromise the performance of the sensors ( Morciano et al . , 2017 ) . Another problem is the strong pH dependency of these genetically encoded ATP sensors , due to the innate pH sensitivity of the fluorescent proteins used ( Chudakov et al . , 2010; Tsien , 1998 ) . This pH dependence is especially problematic in in vivo ATP imaging , because changes in ATP concentration in tissues are often accompanied by pH fluctuations ( Berg et al . , 2009; Di Virgilio et al . , 2018; Gourine et al . , 2010 ) . Another strategy to develop fluorescent sensors is a hybrid-type probe design in which a small-molecule fluorescent dye is conjugated to a ligand-binding protein ( Takikawa et al . , 2014; Wang et al . , 2009 ) . We previously developed a hybrid-type glutamate sensor , in which the AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit is employed as a glutamate-binding protein ( Namiki et al . , 2007 ) , and visualized extrasynaptic glutamate dynamics in vivo ( Okubo et al . , 2010 ) . In this study , to develop a hybrid-type ATP sensor , we adopted bacterial FoF1-ATP synthase \u03b5 subunit as an ATP-binding protein , because fluorescent-dye conjugation has been used to study conformational changes of the protein upon ATP binding ( Iino et al . , 2005; Kato et al . , 2007 ) . We screened fluorescent dyes and their labeling sites within the ATP-binding protein , and obtained a highly sensitive ATP sensor with a large fluorescence response , high selectivity for ATP , and insensitivity to pH fluctuation , suitable for detection of extracellular ATP . The sensor can be anchored on the plasma membrane to detect extracellular ATP . To illustrate potential applications of the sensor , we performed extracellular ATP imaging in the brain of living mice , and observed the propagation of a wave-like extracellular ATP increase through the cerebral cortex in response to neuronal excitation evoked by electrical stimulation . The results confirm that the ATP sensor is suitable for in vivo imaging of the dynamics of extracellular ATP signaling . \n To visualize extracellular ATP , we designed a hybrid-type fluorescent ATP sensor composed of an ATP-binding protein and a small-molecule fluorescent dye . We adopted the \u03b5 subunit of FoF1-ATP synthase of thermophilic Bacillus PS3 , which has high affinity for ATP ( Kato-Yamada and Yoshida , 2003 ) , as the ATP-binding protein , and introduced a single cysteine substitution in its amino-acid sequence to enable the conjugation of a small-molecule fluorescent dye bearing a cysteine-reactive maleimide group ( Figure 1A ) . The performance of a hybrid-type sensor is determined by the location of the fluorophore within the ligand-binding protein ( Namiki et al . , 2007; Takikawa et al . , 2014 ) . To obtain a high-sensitivity ATP sensor , we used our previously developed high-throughput screening system , HyFInD ( Takikawa et al . , 2014 ) , in which a large variety of fluorescent conjugates can be generated by varying both the fluorophore conjugation sites and the fluorophores , and then evaluated for fluorescence response to a ligand . We generated 134 cysteine mutants covering every position in the amino-acid sequence except for the first position ( the initiating methionine ) . We used four small-molecule fluorescent dyes , Oregon Green ( OG ) , Alexa Fluor 488 ( Alexa488 ) , Cy3 and SiR650 , resulting in the generation of 536 fluorescent conjugates in total . For the initial screening we employed a high concentration ( 2 mM ) of ATP to select sensors having a large dynamic range of fluorescence response . For each of the four fluorophores , we found a moderate number of fluorescent conjugates showing detectable fluorescence changes upon application of ATP , but with a large variation in the response ( Figure 1B ) . Notably , even if the fluorophore labeling site was the same , the fluorescence response varied depending on the type of fluorophore . We then selected eight fluorescent conjugates as candidate sensors showing a large fluorescence response in the initial screening , and tested their fluorescence response to a low ATP concentration ( 200 nM ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Variation in the fluorescence response was again observed , as in the case of the higher concentration of ATP . The conjugate exhibiting the largest fluorescence response at 200 nM ATP was the Cy3-labeled cysteine substitution mutant at glutamine 105 ( Q105C-Cy3 ) . We hereafter designate Q105C-Cy3 as ATPOS ( ATP Optical Sensor ) . We next examined the characteristics of ATPOS in more detail . In the absence of ATP , ATPOS displayed a fluorescence excitation peak at 556 nm and an emission peak at 566 nm ( Figure 1C; Table 1 ) . At 1 mM ATP , the fluorescence intensity of ATPOS increased without any appreciable change in the peak wavelengths ( excitation peak at 556 nm , emission peak at 564 nm ) , while the absorption spectrum showed almost no change upon the addition of ATP ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . On the other hand , the fluorescence quantum yield increased from 0 . 29 to 0 . 62 ( Table 1 ) . The results indicate that the change in fluorescence intensity is due to the change in the quantum yield . To estimate the sensitivity of ATPOS for ATP , we examined the dependence of the fluorescence change of ATPOS on the concentration of ATP ( Figure 1D ) . Fluorescence changes were observed at submicromolar concentrations , and fitting the Hill equation to the dose-response data yielded an apparent dissociation constant of\u00a0~150 nM and a Hill coefficient of 1 . 08 . The results suggest that ATPOS has sufficiently high affinity for ATP to be applicable for the visualization of extracellular ATP . The Hill coefficient value of\u00a0~1 suggests that ATPOS binds to ATP with 1:1 stoichiometry . We also compared the affinity for ATP with those for ATP metabolites and other nucleotides to examine the selectivity of ATPOS . The affinity for ATP was about one hundred-fold higher than that for ADP , and ATPOS was almost insensitive to other metabolites of ATP , such as AMP and adenosine , and other nucleotides such as GTP , CTP and UTP ( Figure 1D ) . To study the kinetics of ATPOS , we performed stopped-flow measurements ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C , D and E ) . The observed rate constants showed a dose-dependent increase ranging from 5 . 0 s\u22121 at 0 . 5 \u03bcM ATP to 8 . 9 s\u22121 at 2 . 0 \u03bcM ATP . We also measured fluorescence decay of ATPOS upon a decrease in ATP concentration , and determined the decay rate constant to be 2 . 0 s\u22121 . These results suggest that the association and dissociation kinetics of ATPOS is fast enough to monitor ATP dynamics on a time scale of seconds . The pH dependence of ATP sensors is a critical determinant of the accuracy of ATP quantification , because pH fluctuations often occur at the same time as changes in ATP concentration ( Berg et al . , 2009; Di Virgilio et al . , 2018; Gourine et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , we assessed the pH sensitivity of ATPOS and observed no fluorescence response to changes in pH from 6 . 0 to 8 . 5 in the presence or absence of ATP ( Figure 1E ) . For in vivo ATP imaging with ATPOS , we introduced two additional features . Firstly , in order to anchor ATPOS to the outer surface of cell membranes , enabling it to report extracellular ATP in brain tissue , we employed BoNT/C-Hc , a nontoxic subunit of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin , which binds to the plasma membrane of neurons ( Tsukamoto et al . , 2005 ) . Secondly , we introduced a capability for dual-color ratiometric imaging , which should mitigate the effect of spatial inhomogeneity of sensor concentration , as well as movement artifacts . For this purpose , we employed Alexa488 as a fluorophore for a reference color channel . Accordingly , we assembled a molecular complex of ATPOS with BoNT/C-Hc and Alexa488 labeled-streptavidin ( Figure 2A ) . The ATPOS complex exhibited a large fluorescence change in the red ( Cy3 ) channel and high sensitivity for ATP , comparable to those of ATPOS itself , whereas it showed no fluorescence change in the green ( Alexa488 ) channel ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Therefore , the ratio of red to green fluorescence provides a measure of ATP concentration . We next tested the performance of the ATPOS complex anchored to cellular membranes using primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons . After the ATPOS complex was applied , followed by wash-out , both red and green fluorescence was observed along the neurons ( Figure 2B ) , indicating successful anchoring of the ATPOS complex on the neuronal cell surface . The fluorescence intensity in the red channel increased upon ATP addition , but that in the green channel did not; consequently the fluorescence ratio was increased . These results indicate that the ATPOS complex anchored on the neuronal surface can work as a ratiometric sensor of extracellular ATP . We then applied the ATPOS complex for extracellular ATP imaging in the cerebral cortex of living mice . The ATPOS complex was pressure-injected into layer 2/3 of the cerebral cortex with a fine glass pipette through a craniotomy ( Figure 3A ) . The area labeled by ATPOS , identified by its fluorescence , gradually spread across the cortex to occupy a region 2 mm in diameter ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . The fluorescence of ATPOS was stably observed after the end of the injection . To examine the distribution of ATPOS in the cerebral cortex with cellular resolution , we performed two-photon imaging of the target cortical area , and found that the blood vessels and cell bodies remained unstained ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . These results indicate that ATPOS is immobilized in the extracellular space of the cortex . To confirm that ATPOS introduced into the cerebral cortex in this way works as a sensor of extracellular ATP , we next injected ATP into the cortex with a glass pipette , and visualized the ratiometric fluorescence response of ATPOS by means of wide-field fluorescence microscopy . Injection of ATP elicited an increase of the fluorescence ratio to a peak amplitude of 6 . 5 \u00b1 0 . 6% ( n\u00a0=\u00a018 from five mice ) ( Figure 3B and C; Figure 3\u2014videos 1 and 2 ) . To check the selectivity of ATPOS\u2019s response , we applied apyrase , which sequentially hydrolyzes ATP to ADP and ADP to AMP , to the cortex , and observed whether it reduced the fluorescence response of ATPOS to the ATP injection . In the presence of apyrase , the peak amplitude of the ratio was reduced to 2 . 4 \u00b1 0 . 5% ( n\u00a0=\u00a014 from three mice ) , while a sham injection containing bovine serum albumin had almost no effect ( Figure 3D and E ) . These results support the view that ATPOS applied in the mouse cortex does indeed report the extracellular ATP concentration . We then attempted to visualize extracellular ATP endogenously released during neuronal excitation in living mice . Previous reports indicate that a propagating wave of neuronal depolarization evoked by electrical stimulation or KCl application to the brain ( Pietrobon and Moskowitz , 2014 ) causes elevation of the extracellular ATP concentration ( Heinrich et al . , 2012; Schock et al . , 2007 ) . Accordingly , we delivered electrical stimulation to the cortex with a metal microelectrode to induce a wave of neuronal depolarization , and observed the fluorescence response of ATPOS during the neuronal excitation under a wide-field microscope ( Figure 4A ) . The ratiometric images show a wave-like propagation starting around the electrode ( Figure 4B and C; Figure 4\u2014video 1 ) . A precipitous rise of the fluorescence intensity is seen at the wave front , and the increase shifts in a radial direction away from the stimulation site ( Figure 4D ) . The increase of the ratio , which showed a peak amplitude of\u00a0~30% , lasted about 2 min . To verify that this wave-like propagation represented the dynamics of extracellular ATP , we compared the fluorescence responses of ATPOS to the stimulation before and after the application of apyrase . In the presence of apyrase , although a wave-like propagation could still be discerned ( Figure 4E and F; Figure 4\u2014video 2 ) , its peak amplitude was substantially reduced to 15 . 8 \u00b1 2 . 5% ( n\u00a0=\u00a07 from five mice ) while that of the controls was 31 . 4 \u00b1 1 . 4% ( n\u00a0=\u00a011 from five mice ) ( Figure 4G and H ) . These results suggest that the wave-like propagation of fluorescence changes of ATPOS reflects the dynamics of extracellular ATP signaling during neuronal excitation . In addition , to visualize the dynamics of extracellular ATP during the neuronal excitation at a single cross section , we performed two-photon imaging of ATPOS upon electrical stimulation in layer 2/3 , where ATPOS was injected ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The wave-like propagation of fluorescence changes of ATPOS was also observed at a single cross section in layer 2/3 . These results are consistent with those obtained by wide-field microscopy , showing the wave-like propagation of extracellular ATP during neuronal excitation . \n In the present study , we developed a fluorescent ATP sensor that enables real-time imaging of extracellular ATP dynamics in vivo , and we showed that this sensor , ATPOS , can visualize wave-like extracellular ATP signaling in the cerebral cortex of living mice in response to electrical stimulation . ATPOS has at least four advantages for in vivo visualization of extracellular ATP . First , ATPOS has a very high affinity for ATP; its apparent dissociation constant is\u00a0~150 nM , while those of previously reported fluorescent ATP sensors , such as ATeam , QUEEN and iATPSnFR , are in the range of several micromolar to several millimolar ( Arai et al . , 2018; Conley et al . , 2017; Imamura et al . , 2009; Lobas et al . , 2019; Yaginuma et al . , 2015 ) . The low affinity of the conventional sensors makes them unsuitable for in vivo extracellular ATP imaging . Second , ATPOS displays high brightness; its fluorescence quantum yield ( QY ) in the presence of ATP was around 0 . 62 , while that of Cy3 itself , which is employed in ATPOS , is only around 0 . 04 ( Table 1 ) . The QY of ATPOS is equivalent to that of Cy3B ( QY\u00a0=\u00a00 . 67 ) , a rigidified analog of Cy3 , which was designed to prevent nonradiative energy loss due to rotational and translational vibration modes ( Cooper et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore the high brightness of ATPOS may result from restriction of the intramolecular vibration modes of Cy3 within ATPOS . Third , ATPOS shows high selectivity for ATP over ATP metabolites and other nucleotides . Therefore , compared with conventional fluorescent sensors targeting adenine compounds ( Tokunaga et al . , 2012 ) or nucleoside polyphosphates ( Kurishita et al . , 2012 ) , ATPOS should be better suited to study the specific roles of extracellular ATP , because derivatives of ATP also work as extracellular signaling molecules ( Dunwiddie and Masino , 2001 ) . This characteristic of ATPOS is likely attributable to the ligand selectivity of the \u03b5 subunit of FoF1-ATP synthase ( Kato-Yamada and Yoshida , 2003 ) , because existing ATP sensors with high selectivity , including ATeam , QUEEN and iATPSnFR , also adopt the \u03b5 subunit as an ATP-binding protein ( Arai et al . , 2018; Conley et al . , 2017; Imamura et al . , 2009; Lobas et al . , 2019; Yaginuma et al . , 2015 ) . Lastly , ATPOS is insensitive to pH changes . Existing fluorescent protein-based ATP sensors all show pH-dependent changes of fluorescence intensity ( Arai et al . , 2018; Berg et al . , 2009; Imamura et al . , 2009; Lobas et al . , 2019; Tantama et al . , 2013; Yaginuma et al . , 2015 ) . The pH insensitivity of ATPOS can be ascribed to its hybrid-type design , in which a pH-insensitive small-molecule fluorescent dye is employed instead of a fluorescent protein . This feature of ATPOS enables precise quantitative analysis of ATP dynamics regardless of pH fluctuations . Although pH in the brain is homeostatically regulated , pH fluctuations are known to occur concomitantly with neuronal activity ( Chesler and Kaila , 1992; Magnotta et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , the brain pH can change drastically in pathological conditions such as ischemia ( Nedergaard et al . , 1991 ) . Thus , its pH insensitivity greatly extends the applicability of ATPOS to various biological conditions . Despite these great advantages over genetically encoded sensors , there are drawbacks in the use of ATPOS . One is that the injection procedure required for delivery of ATPOS might cause tissue damage . Although this possibility should be taken into account , we suppose that the tissue damage is likely to be limited , given that the glass micropipette used for the injection procedure is similar in shape to glass electrodes conventionally used in electrophysiological experiments . Another drawback is that targeting ATPOS to specific cell types is not readily feasible . We anticipate that combining technology for cell type-specific display of tag proteins might enable the specific targeting of ATPOS ( Hinner and Johnsson , 2010 ) . The screening of fluorophore labeling sites enabled us to select ATP sensors exhibiting a large fluorescence response to ATP . The maximal fluorescence response of ATPOS to ATP is about 2-fold , which is sufficient for the detection of ATP dynamics in vivo . Some ATP sensors found through the screening exhibited a large fluorescence change , but showed low sensitivity . For example , the Alexa488-labeled sensor in which serine-64 was replaced by cysteine ( S64C-Alexa488 ) , whose EC50 was tens of micromolar , showed about 200% maximal fluorescence response to ATP . These low-affinity ATP sensors obtained in the screening may be useful for ATP imaging under circumstances where the ATP concentration is elevated to such high levels . We also obtained different-colored ATP sensors displaying green or near-infrared fluorescence . This rich color variation should enable multiplexed imaging of ATP together with Ca2+ and other signaling molecules , and should also be compatible with the manipulation of cellular activities by means of optogenetics . ATPOS revealed the dynamic response of extracellular ATP to electrical stimulation ( 10 mA for 1 s ) in the cerebral cortex of living mice . Such electrical stimulation has been used to evoke a propagating wave of neuronal depolarization ( Reid et al . , 1987 ) , known as cortical spreading depression ( CSD ) , which is involved in the pathogenesis of migraine and stroke ( Lauritzen et al . , 2011 ) . We found that the elevation of extracellular ATP around the stimulation site propagates through the cortex in a concentric fashion . Although the elevation of extracellular ATP concentration during CSD is already known ( Heinrich et al . , 2012; Schock et al . , 2007 ) , its spatial dynamics have not been reported . We found that the ATP wave propagated at the speed of\u00a0~2 mm/min , which is comparable to the reported rate of neuronal propagation of CSD , 2 to 5 mm/min ( Khennouf et al . , 2016; Takagaki et al . , 2014; van den Maagdenberg et al . , 2004 ) , suggesting a role of the ATP-release mechanism in CSD . The precipitous rise of ATP at the wave front suggests that the ATP wave is likely to be formed by active propagation of ATP release , rather than passive diffusion . In addition , the ATP wave was observed in the entire field of view , suggesting that the elevation of ATP concentration occurs across a broad area of the brain . Given that ATP works as a signaling molecule for both neurons and glial cells ( Burnstock , 2007; Fields and Burnstock , 2006; Khakh and North , 2012 ) , the ATP wave during CSD may play an important role in the cellular processes involved in the pathogenesis of migraine and stroke ( Charles and Baca , 2013; Pedata et al . , 2016 ) . We anticipate that ATPOS will be a useful tool not only for studies of these pathophysiological processes , but also for investigating the feasibility of novel clinical treatments targeting ATP signaling . \n All procedures used in animal experiments were in accordance with the guidelines established by the Animal Welfare Committee of the University of Tokyo . Hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats ( SLC; embryonic , 21 days old ) . The embryos were decapitated , and the hippocampi were dissected out and treated with trypsin ( Life Technologies ) and DNase I ( Sigma ) . The dissociated neurons were incubated on glial cell monolayers plated on coverslips coated with laminin ( Life Technologies ) and poly-L-lysine ( Nacalai tesque ) in Neurobasal A medium ( Life Technologies ) supplemented with B-27 supplement ( Life Technologies ) , 0 . 5 mM Glutamax ( Life Technologies ) , 1 mM sodium pyruvate ( Nacalai tesque ) , and 1% penicillin/streptomycin ( Nacalai tesque ) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 . HyFInD screening followed the protocols described in our previous work with a few modifications ( Takikawa et al . , 2014 ) . A synthetic gene encoding the \u03b5 subunit of FoF1-ATP synthase of thermophilic Bacillus PS3 was obtained from Genescript , and inserted into the NdeI/XhoI site of a modified pET23a vector ( Novagen ) with an 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0His tag . Cysteine mutants of the ATP-binding protein were comprehensively generated by inverse PCR for site-directed mutagenesis . The pair of primers used in the inverse PCR was designed in a back-to-back orientation , and the original codon at the 5\u2019-end of the forward primer was replaced with a cysteine codon . After 5\u2019-kination using T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Toyobo ) , the PCR products were recircularized with a DNA ligation kit ver . 2 . 1 ( Toyobo ) . For bacterial production of the recombinant proteins , Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells ( Stratagene ) were transformed with the circularized PCR products . The transformed cells were grown overnight in a semisolid medium containing 2% tryptone , 0 . 5% yeast extract , 8 . 6 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 1 mM NaOH , 20 mM MgSO4 , 100 \u03bcg/ml carbenicillin and 0 . 8% agarose ( SeaPrep ) in a 96-deep-well plate at 30\u00b0C . Fifty microliters of the melted medium was added to 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0YT medium ( 1 . 6% tryptone , 1% yeast extract , and 86 mM NaCl ) containing 100 \u03bcg/ml carbenicillin in a 96-deep-well plate . The bacteria were incubated at 37\u00b0C until the OD600 reached 0 . 4\u20130 . 8 . Further incubation at 25\u00b0C for 12 hr was performed in the presence of 0 . 4 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-thiogalactoside ( IPTG ) ( Nacalai tesque ) . The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS; 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 1 . 5 mM KH2PO4 , and 8 . 1 mM Na2HPO4; pH 7 . 4 ) with lysis mix buffer ( 10 mM MgCl2 , 10 \u03bcg/ml lysozyme , 0 . 027% BriJ 58 , and 3 . 3 U/ml DNase I ) . For purification of the recombinant proteins , the cleared lysate was incubated for 45 min in a 96-well filter plate containing TALON metal affinity resin ( Clontech ) , followed by washing with PBS containing 10 mM imidazole ( Nacalai tesque ) . For fluorophore labeling , the recombinant proteins absorbed on the resin were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 45 min with Oregon Green ( OG ) maleimide ( Life Technologies ) , Alexa Fluor 488 ( Alexa488 ) maleimide ( Life Technologies ) , Cy3 maleimide ( GE Healthcare ) , or SiR650-PEG3-maleimide , which were dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 4 \u03bcM . SiR650-PEG3-maleimide was prepared by conjugating a maleimide group to SiR-carboxy ( Lukinavi\u010dius et al . , 2013 ) via a PEG3 linker . The resin was washed with PBS containing 10 mM imidazole , and the fluorescent conjugates were eluted with PBS containing 150 mM imidazole and 0 . 1% bovine serum albumin . For the performance test of the fluorescent conjugates , the fluorescence intensity in each well of a 96-well plate was automatically scanned with a custom-built fluorescence plate reader system . OG- or Alexa488-labeled conjugates were excited at 460\u2013480 nm and emission was measured at 495\u2013540 nm . Cy3-labeled conjugates were excited at 535\u2013555 nm and emission was measured at 570\u2013625 nm . SiR650-labeled conjugates were excited at 608\u2013648 nm and emission was measured at 672\u2013712 nm . In the first screening , fluorescence changes upon addition of ATP ( Sigma ) at a final concentration of 2 mM were measured . In the second screening , fluorescence changes upon addition of ATP at a final concentration of 200 nM were measured . Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells were transformed with plasmids encoding the ATP-binding protein with Q105C mutation ( ATPBP-Q105C ) . The transformed cells were incubated in 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0YT media containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin at 37\u00b0C until the OD600 reached 0 . 5\u20130 . 8 . Further incubation at 25\u00b0C for 16 hr was performed in the presence of 0 . 4 mM IPTG , followed by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 15 min at 2 , 070 g . The harvested cells were lysed by means of a freeze-thaw procedure in PBS containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme and then incubated at 4\u00b0C for 15 min in PBS containing 0 . 1% Triton X100 , 10 mM MgCl2 , and 3 U/ml DNaseI ( Takara ) . After centrifugation of the cell lysate at 4\u00b0C for 30 min at 15 , 000 g , the collected supernatant was purified by using HiTrap TALON crude ( BD Biosciences ) . The purified ATPBP-Q105C proteins ( 10 \u03bcM ) were incubated with Cy3 maleimide ( 50 \u03bcM ) in PBS at 25\u00b0C for 45 min . The labeled proteins were separated from unreacted dyes on a PD-10 desalting column ( GE Healthcare ) . If further purification was necessary , anion-exchange chromatography was carried out on COSMOGEL IEX Type Q ( Nacalai tesque ) by applying a linear salt gradient . The chromatography was performed with an AKTA purifier ( GE Healthcare ) according to the instructions of the manufacturer . To create the ATPOS complex , which enables the anchoring of ATPOS on neuronal surfaces , ATPOS ( 4 \u03bcM ) was biotinylated with NHS-PEG4-biotin ( Thermo Scientific ) at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM in PBS at 25\u00b0C for 1 hr , followed by separation from unreacted NHS-PEG4-biotin on a NAP-5 desalting column ( GE Healthcare ) . Biotinylated BoNT/C-Hc was prepared as described previously ( Takikawa et al . , 2014 ) . Alexa Fluor 488 streptavidin ( degree of labeling 5 , Thermo Scientific ) , the biotinylated BoNT/C-Hc , and the biotinylated ATPOS were mixed in a buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , and 2 . 5 mM KCl; pH 7 . 4 ) at final concentrations of 2 \u03bcM , 2 \u03bcM , and 6 \u03bcM , respectively . Absorption spectra were obtained in HEPES-buffered saline ( HBS; 50 mM HEPES , 125 mM NaCl , 4 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl2 , and 1 mM MgCl2 ) containing 0 . 1% bovine serum albumin at pH 7 . 4 with a spectrometer ( V-550 , JASCO ) at 25\u201326\u00b0C . Fluorescence spectroscopic measurements were performed in HBS containing 0 . 1% bovine serum albumin at pH 7 . 4 with a spectrofluorometer ( FP-6500 , JASCO ) . The excitation wavelengths of Cy3 and Alexa488 were 550 nm and 490 nm , respectively , and the emission wavelengths were 570 nm and 519 nm , respectively . Fluorescence intensities were measured three times at each concentration of ATP , ADP ( Sigma ) , AMP ( Sigma ) , adenosine ( Sigma ) , CTP ( Apollo Scientific ) , GTP ( Nacalai tesque ) , or UTP ( Combi-Blocks ) at 25\u201326\u00b0C . Mean values of the triplicate measurements were calculated for each sample . The apparent dissociation constant and Hill coefficient were determined by fitting to the Hill equation . For the assessment of pH dependence , HEPES ( pH 7 . 0\u20138 . 5 ) or MES ( pH 6 . 0\u20136 . 5 ) was used as a buffer compound . The fluorescence quantum yield ( QY ) was determined by using Rhodamine B in basic ethanol ( QY\u00a0=\u00a00 . 65 ) as a standard ( Kubin and Fletcher , 1982 ) . Measurements for the kinetic analysis were performed with a stopped-flow apparatus ( SFM 2000 , BioLogic ) , whose flow path was pretreated with a solution ( 155 mM NaCl , 3 mM Na2HPO4 , and 1 mM KH2PO4; pH 7 . 4 ) containing 1% gelatin ( Sigma ) or with Bullet Blocking One ( Nacalai tesque ) for blocking , followed by extensive washing with Milli-Q water . For measuring association kinetics , equal volumes of HBS with 0 . 1% bovine serum albumin containing either ATPOS or ATP were mixed at\u00a0~20 nM final concentration of ATPOS . For measuring dissociation kinetics , HBS containing 5 nM ATPOS and 200 nM ATP was diluted with an equal volume of HBS . Cy3 was excited at 546 nm and the emission was collected through a 570\u2013625 nm band-pass filter ( Olympus ) . Fluorescence intensity was measured five times at each concentration of ATP at 25\u201326\u00b0C . Averaged traces of fluorescence intensity , F , were fitted with the following equation:F=c0+c1t+c2e\u2212kt ( cn:constant ) where k is the observed rate constant . Cultured neurons were incubated with ATPOS complex at a final ATPOS concentration of 600 nM in physiological salt solution ( 50 mM HEPES , 125 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl2 , 1 mM MgCl2 , and 25 mM glucose; pH 7 . 4 ) containing 0 . 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature . After 10 min incubation , the cells were washed four times with physiological salt solution containing 0 . 1% bovine serum albumin . Fluorescence images were acquired with an inverted microscope ( IX-71 , Olympus ) equipped with an EM-CCD camera ( iXon EM+ , Andor ) and a 75 W xenon light source ( U-LH75XEAPO , Olympus ) , using a\u00a0\u00d7\u00a040/0 . 95 NA dry objective lens ( UPlanSApo , Olympus ) . Cy3 was excited at 520\u2013550 nm and the emission was measured at wavelengths longer than 580 nm with a filter set ( Olympus ) . Alexa488 was excited at 460\u2013480 nm and the emission was measured at 495\u2013540 nm with a filter set ( Olympus ) . The extracellular solution was physiological salt solution containing 0 . 1% bovine serum albumin and 100 \u03bcM ARL 67156 ( Sigma ) at pH 7 . 4 . Male C57BL/6 mice ( SLC; postnatal 1\u20132 months old ) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of medetomidine ( Nippon Zenyaku; 0 . 75 mg/kg ) , midazolam ( Sandoz; 4 mg/kg ) , and butorphanol ( Meiji Seika Pharma; 5 mg/kg ) . The depth of anesthesia was assessed by tail pinch . The body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C with a heating pad ( BWT-100A , Bio Research Center ) throughout the experiment . After the scalp was removed , a custom-made metal frame was attached to the exposed skull with dental acrylic ( Fuji LUTE BC , GC ) for head fixation . A 4-mm-diameter craniotomy centered 3 mm posterior to the bregma and 3 mm lateral to the midline was performed with a dental drill . The dura was left intact during the procedure . The ATPOS complex solution was pressure-injected into the cerebral cortex for 20\u201330 min through a glass micropipette whose tip was inserted to a depth of 300 \u03bcm from the pia . The surface of the cortex was covered with artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( aCSF; 125 mM NaCl , 4 . 5 mM KCl , 1 . 25 mM NaH2PO4 , 26 mM NaHCO3 , 2 mM CaCl2 , 1 mM MgCl2 , and 20 mM glucose; pH 7 . 4 ) . Fluorescence images were captured with a wide-field microscope ( M165FC , Leica ) equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp with a high-speed scanning polychromatic light source ( C7773 , Hamamatsu Photonics ) and an EM-CCD camera ( Evolve 512 , Roper Scientific ) , using a\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 . 0 objective lens ( Plan APO , Leica ) . Cy3 and Alexa488 were excited at 555 nm and 490 nm , respectively , and the emissions of Cy3 and Alexa488 were sequentially collected at 2 . 5 Hz ( 200 ms duration for each emission ) through a filter set ( Leica ) at 592\u2013682 nm and at 505\u2013540 nm , respectively . Two-photon ATP imaging was performed using a two-photon laser scanning microscope ( Leica TCS SP8 MPO , Leica ) equipped with an optical parametric oscillator ( OPO ) laser system and a HyD detector ( Leica ) , using a\u00a0\u00d7\u00a025/0 . 95 NA water-immersion objective lens ( HCX IR APO , Leica ) . Cy3 was excited at 1 , 045 nm and the emission was collected through a filter set ( Semrock ) at 565\u2013605 nm . Test compounds or reagents dissolved in aCSF were pressure-injected at 1 psi into the cerebral cortex with a glass micropipette ( 10 \u03bcm inner tip diameter ) inserted at the depth of 300 \u03bcm from the surface . For ATP application , 10 mM ATP was pressure-injected for 10 s . In some experiments , 100 U/ml apyrase ( Nacalai tesque ) or bovine serum albumin at a concentration equivalent to that of apyrase was pressure-injected for 15 min . For electrical stimulation , a monopolar tungsten microelectrode ( 1\u20133 M\u03a9 , FHC ) was placed below the dura , and a ground electrode was attached to the custom-made metal frame for head fixation . A train of 100 \u03bcs pulses at 200 Hz lasting for 1 s with an intensity of 10 mA was delivered using a stimulus isolator ( ISO-Flex , AMPI ) . Image data were analyzed with ImageJ software ( NIH; ver . 1 . 50e ) . After background fluorescence was subtracted from images , fluorescence response ( R/R0 or F/F0 ) was calculated relative to the baseline before ATP application or electrical stimulation . All data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM . Wilcoxon\u2019s rank-sum tests are used to determine statistical significance ."}

Importantly , tumor cells have the ability to divide and grow much faster than normal cells . To protect ourselves from full-grown cancers , our bodies have developed a surveillance system: when a tumor cell starts to divide without restraint , \u201cstress-induced\u201d proteins start to appear on its surface . These proteins help the immune system recognize abnormal or damaged cells , allowing the immune cells to eliminate the defective cells . Despite this system of protection , a tumor cell sometimes manages to avoid having stress-induced proteins placed on its surface , allowing it to remain undetected by the immune system . By studying several different types of human cancer cells , Schmiedel et al . found that a protein called IMP3 is present in cancer cells but not in healthy cells . Further investigation revealed that IMP3 prevents the production of some stress-induced proteins and stops them moving to the cell surface . Schmiedel et al . also show that the presence of the IMP3 protein in cancer cells causes nearby immune cells to become much less active . This suggests that developing drugs that block the activity of IMP3 could help the immune system to fight back and destroy cancer cells .", "source": "Expression of the stress-induced ligands MICA , MICB and ULBP 1\u20136 are up-regulated as a cellular response to DNA damage , excessive proliferation or viral infection; thereby , they enable recognition and annihilation by immune cells that express the powerful activating receptor NKG2D . This receptor is present not exclusively , but primarily on NK cells . Knowledge about the regulatory mechanisms controlling ULBP expression is still vague . In this study , we report a direct interaction of the oncogenic RNA binding protein ( RBP ) IMP3 with ULBP2 mRNA , leading to ULBP2 transcript destabilization and reduced ULBP2 surface expression in several human cell lines . We also discovered that IMP3 indirectly targets MICB with a mechanism functionally distinct from that of ULBP2 . Importantly , IMP3-mediated regulation of stress-ligands leads to impaired NK cell recognition of transformed cells . Our findings shed new light on the regulation of NKG2D ligands and on the mechanism of action of a powerful oncogenic RBP , IMP3 . \n The regulation of protein expression is essential for development , differentiation , maintenance , division and death of cells as well as homeostasis of tissues ( Buszczak et al . , 2014 ) . Regulation of protein biogenesis is controlled on transcriptional , translational and post-translational level ( Day and Tuite , 1998 ) . Critical players in this complex process of protein biogenesis are RNA\u00a0binding proteins ( RPBs ) that control many important aspects such as RNA trafficking , stability and translation rate ( Gerstberger et al . , 2014 ) . The RBPs are also involved in immunological recognition ( Kafasla et al . , 2014 ) . IMP3 ( also known as IGF2BP3 ) is a member of the family of the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding proteins . It binds mRNAs via 6 RNA-binding domains consisting of 2 RNA recognition motif domains ( RRM ) and 4\u2009K Homology domains ( KH ) ( M\u00fceller-Pillasch et al . , 1997 ) . Besides the critical role of IMP3 in fetal development ( Mueller-Pillasch et al . , 1999 ) and fertility ( Li et al . , 2014; Hammer et al . , 2005 ) , its importance as an oncogene in several kinds of cancer was determined in the last few years: Expression of IMP3 could be observed in colon carcinoma ( Li et al . , 2009; Lochhead et al . , 2012; Kumara et al . , 2015 ) , adenocarcinomas ( Bellezza et al . , 2009; Lu et al . , 2009; Gao et al . , 2014 ) , urothelial carcinomas ( Sitnikova et al . , 2008; Xylinas et al . , 2014 ) , lymphomas ( King et al . , 2009; Tang et al . , 2013; Hartmann et al . , 2012 ) , renal cell carcinomas ( Hoffmann et al . , 2008; Jiang et al . , 2006; 2008 ) , and many more ( Hammer et al . , 2005; Chen et al . , 2013; Walter et al . , 2009; K\u00f6bel et al . , 2009; Zhou et al . , 2014 ) . Additionally , high expression of IMP3 often correlates with poor survival prognosis for patients ( Hoffmann et al . , 2008; Jiang et al . , 2006; K\u00f6bel et al . , 2009; Yuan et al . , 2009; Lin et al . , 2013 ) . So far , the role of IMP3 as regulator of cell proliferation , migration and invadopodia formation was mainly studied due to its ability to bind and stabilize mRNAs coding for insulin like growth factor 2 ( IGF2 ) or CD44 ( Liao et al . , 2005; Vikesaa et al . , 2006 ) . Practically nothing is known on its immune evasion properties . NK cells are important for the immune surveillance of transformed cells . They belong to the innate immune system ( although they possess some adaptive features as well [Sun et al . , 2011; Min-Oo et al . , 2013] ) and are able to kill transformed cells , virus-infected cells and to interact with bacteria and fungi ( Wu and Lanier , 2003; Lodoen and Lanier , 2006; Lanier , 2008; Seidel et al . , 2012; Schmidt et al . , 2013; Koch et al . , 2013 ) . The killing by NK cells is mediated by several NK -activating receptors , among them is NKG2D ( Seidel et al . , 2012; Koch et al . , 2013; Bauer et al . , 1999 ) . The ligands of NKG2D are MHC class I polypeptide-related sequences A and B ( MICA , MICB ) and the family of unique length 16 ( UL16 ) binding proteins 1 \u2013 6 ( ULBP 1\u20136 ) , collectively known as stress-induced ligands ( Elias and Mandelboim , 2012 ) . The stress-induced ligands are differentially expressed on the cell surface following stresses like viral infection , heat-shock or genotoxic stress ( Raulet et al . , 2013 ) . Accordingly , these ligands are important for immune surveillance and both cancer cells and viruses often suppress stress ligand surface expression ( Elias and Mandelboim , 2012; Salih et al . , 2002; Fuertes et al . , 2008; Stern-Ginossar and Mandelboim , 2009 ) . Although mRNAs for some of these stress ligands are found almost in every cell , these ligands are barely expressed on the surface of healthy cells ( Stern-Ginossar and Mandelboim , 2009 ) . This suggests that the expression of the NKG2D ligands is also controlled at mRNA level , and indeed , we have previously shown that 10 different cellular miRNAs negatively regulate the expression of MICA and MICB proteins ( Stern-Ginossar et al . , 2007; 2009; Nachmani et al . , 2009 ) . We further demonstrated that several RBPs are involved in the regulation of MICB expression ( Nachmani et al . , 2014 ) . In this study , we show a new mechanism of IMP3 that facilitates immune evasion of cancerous cells by downregulation of the NKG2D ligand ULBP2 in a direct manner and MICB in an indirect manner . Thereby , we give new insights into the complex biological processes that are regulated by this powerful oncogene . Notably , we also discovered the first cellular mechanism acting on ULBP2 . \n Our group has previously demonstrated that the stress-induced ligand MICB is regulated by numerous RBPs that directly affect its stability and expression ( Nachmani et al . , 2014 ) . In order to identify additional regulators of other NKG2D ligands , particularly of the ULBP family , we performed RNA binding protein affinity purification ( RNA-AP ) with subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry ( schematically described in Figure 1A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13426 . 003Figure 1 . RNA affinity purification using the 3 \u2018UTR of ULBP2 . ( A ) Schematic representation of the workflow in RNA affinity purification ( RNA-AP ) . ( B ) Cytoplasmic extracts of RKO cells were incubated with RNA coding for the 3\u2018UTR of ULBP2 or control UTRs . The enriched RNA-binding proteins were run on 10% polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie BB G-250 . A specific band ( indicated with an arrow , 64 kDa ) was excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry . For facilitated visualization , a detail of the Coomassie gel is shown in false color and contrast was increased . ( C ) Top-listed results from mass spectrometry analysis of the excised gel part . IMP3 ( here called IGF2BP3 ) is the hit with the highest coverage and amount of specific and total peptides in the analyzed gel band . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13426 . 003 For that purpose , we cloned the 3\u2019UTR sequences of ULBP1 , 2 and 3 as well as control UTRs and generated in vitro RNAs in presence of biotin-UTP ( Figure 1A ) . About 10 percent of the incorporated UTPs were biotinylated . Next , we generated cytoplasmic extracts of RKO cells ( since they express numerous NKG2D ligands , see figures below ) and incubated the RNAs with the extracts ( Figure 1A ) . We purified the biotinylated RNAs with the specifically bound RBPs using streptavidin-coated sepharose beads and separated the enriched proteins by running the eluates on SDS PAGE gels using reducing conditions . We performed Coomassie staining and excised protein bands that selectively appeared in the lane of ULBP2 ( Figure 1B , a band at 64\u2009kDa , indicated by an arrow ) . The band that can be seen in the ULBP2-3\u2019UTR at about 120\u2009kDa was not specific . Mass spectrometry analysis of an excised gel slice revealed IMP3 ( Figure 1C , named Insulin-like growth factor mRNA-binding protein 3 ) as the protein with the highest coverage ( percentage of protein sequence covered by identified peptides , named '\u03a3Coverage' in Figure 1C ) , the most unique peptides ( number of peptides unique to a specific protein , named \u03a3# Unique peptides in Figure 1C ) and total peptides ( number of peptides that can be attributed to a particular protein , named \u03a3# Peptides in Figure 1C ) , suggesting that IMP3 precipitates with the 3\u2019UTR of ULBP2 . In order to verify that IMP3 indeed regulates the expression of ULBP2 , we transduced RKO cells with a plasmid containing a small hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) that selectively targets IMP3 ( RKO shIMP3 ) . As control , we transduced RKO cells with a scrambled shRNA ( RKO scrambled shRNA ) . We confirmed the knockdown using Western Blot ( WB ) with two different antibodies targeting IMP3 and used GAPDH as reference ( Figure 2A , shown is the WB with one of these anti-IMP3 antibodies ) . Quantification of the WB revealed a remaining protein expression of less than 10 percent ( Figure 2B ) . Additionally , we analyzed mRNA levels of IMP3 using qRT-PCR and observed a residual amount of about 13% mRNA of IMP3 compared to scrambled shRNA ( Figure 2C ) . Next , we analyzed the mRNA levels of the ULBP ligands in RKO shIMP3 compared to scrambled shRNA and observed a significant increase of ULBP2 mRNA levels following knockdown of IMP3 but no changes in mRNA levels of the other ULBP family members 1 and 3 ( Figure 2D ) . To assess the significance of this knockdown , we performed flow cytometry analysis of the NKG2D ligands ULBP1 , 2 and 3 . We observed an elevation in levels of ULBP2 upon IMP3 knockdown of more than 30% . The surface expression of ULBP3 was unchanged , while little or no expression of ULBP1 was observed on RKO cells prior and after the IMP3 knockdown ( Figure 2E ) . We quantified changes in ULBP2 levels in Figure 2F . In order to exclude a possible off-target effect of the shRNA that might cause the observed effects on the stress-ligand expression , we performed a rescue experiment of IMP3 expression in RKO ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Expectedly , stress-ligand levels decreased back after the transduction of IMP3 in shIMP3 cells . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13426 . 004Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13426 . 005 To further validate the findings seen for the knockdown of IMP3 we transduced RKO cells with an IMP3 overexpression vector . We verified the overexpression using WB with GAPDH as reference ( Figure 3A ) . The WB quantification revealed a 9-fold overexpression of this RBP ( Figure 3B ) . The RNA levels of IMP3 were also significantly increased after transduction ( Figure 3C ) . Compared to the knockdown of IMP3 , RNA levels and FACS analysis of the overexpression revealed inverse effects on the stress-ligand expression ( Figure 3D and E ) . RNA levels in overexpression cells were about 20% reduced compared to the control cells for ULBP2 , but not for ULBP3 . In FACS analysis , the surface expression of ULBP2 decreased by about 10% . The surface expression of ULBP1 and ULBP3 was unchanged as seen for the knockdown . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13426 . 006Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13426 . 006 To see if the effect of IMP3 on the stress-induced ligands ULBP2 is specific for the colon carcinoma RKO cell line , we performed a knockdown of IMP3 in the colorectal carcinoma HCT116 and in the embryonic kidney-derived cell line 293T and verified the knockdowns using WB . In HCT116 cells , the shRNA targeting IMP3 caused a loss of about 85%; in 293T cells , we could virtually not detect any remaining IMP3 protein ( Figure 4A , quantified in Figure 4B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13426 . 007Figure 4 .

Rescue IMP3 in 293T shIMP3 cells reverses ULBP2 increase . 293T transduced with a shRNA targeting IMP3 were selected using puromycin and subsequently transduced with IMP3 using a lentiviral vector . FACS analysis of stress-ligand expression of ULBP2 is shown; staining of shIMP3 cells transduced with an empty vector as black histogram and cells with rescued IMP3 expression as red histogram . The grey filled histogram is the background staining determined for an isotype mouse IgG antibody .

Figure shows each one representative plot out of three experiments performed . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13426 . 008 Notably , we observed similar effects in all IMP3 knockdown cell lines on stress-ligand expression ( Figure 4C ) . In HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell lines , the knockdown resulted in a significant increase of ULBP2 of more than 30%; similarly , we observed an increase of about 15% for ULBP2 in 293T upon IMP3 loss this cell line ( Figure 4D ) . In order to exclude off-target effects of the shRNA in this cell line as well , we performed a rescue experiment of IMP3 expression in 293T as well ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . As we observed for RKO , ULBP2 levels in 293T cells decreased back after the transduction of IMP3 in shIMP3 cells . To confirm our findings , we performed the overexpression of IMP3 also in HCT116 and 293T cells . In both cell lines , we saw an even stronger decrease of ULBP2 in comparison to RKO after overexpression of IMP3 ( Figure 4D ) : 25% for HCT116 and 35% loss for 293T cells . The results are quantified in Figure 4F . We next investigated the mechanism by which the RBP\u00a0IMP3 affects ULBP2 expression . To this end , we incubated RKO shIMP3 and RKO scrambled shRNA for 16\u2009hr with the transcription inhibitor D-Actinomycin or with DMSO as diluent control . D-Actinomycin blocks the elongation process of the RNA polymerase II thereby suppressing the generation of new mRNAs . Consequently , a comparison of the RNA levels in the diluent control and the D-Actinomycin treated cells shows the rate of mRNA decay of a specific gene of interest tested in qRT-PCR . After 16\u2009hr , we isolated total RNA and performed subsequently qRT-PCR analysis on the corresponding cDNAs . We defined the amount of mRNAs in the DMSO-treated control as 1 and calculated the remaining mRNA levels after D-Actinomycin treatment for RKO shIMP3 and RKO scrambled shRNA . Since no new transcripts can be synthesized due to D-Actinomycin treatment , all observed differences are due to alterations in the RNA decay rate . Interestingly , we observed significantly increased amounts of transcript coding for ULBP2 in absence of IMP3 ( shIMP3 ) , but \u2013 expectedly \u2013 no difference in the levels of ULBP3 ( Figure 5 ) . For ULBP2 , about 45% of the initial RNA levels were still present after 16\u2009hr of treatment in the IMP3-knockdown cell lines , but only about 30% in the RKO cell line with a scrambled shRNA ( Figure 5 ) . Therefore , we assumed a direct IMP3 binding to ULBP2 mRNA that decreases RNA half-life . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13426 . 009Figure 5 . Stability determinations of mRNA transcripts of ULBP2 and 3 . RKO transfected with a scrambled shRNA ( control ) or with shIMP3 were treated with D Actinomycin or with DMSO as control . 16\u2009hr later , mRNAs were isolated and cDNA was prepared . The various mRNA transcripts were analyzed using qRT-PCR . Transcript levels were compared by normalization to GAPDH and by setting transcript levels determined for DMSO treatment as 1 . Figure shows merged data of three replicates . *p<0 . 01 for ULBP2 in student\u2019s t-test; for ULBP3 , no significant differences were observed ( NS ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13426 . 009 To further demonstrate that IMP3 directly interacts with the 3\u2019UTRs of ULBP2 , we fused the 3\u2019UTRs of ULBP2 and two control UTRs - ULBP3 and CD247 3\u2019UTRs ( we used the 3\u2019UTR of CD247 ( CD3\u03b6 ) that seemed unlikely to be affected by IMP3 ) to luciferase genes in the vector pGL3 ( schematically described in Figure 6A ) . The constructs were transiently expressed in RKO shIMP3 cells or RKO scrambled shRNA cells and luciferase activity was determined . Following the knockdown of IMP3 , we observed a significant increase if the luciferase gene was fused to the ULBP2-3\u2019UTR only ( Figure 6B ) . The luciferase activity of all other constructs was not affected . Taking the results of the stability determination in consideration ( Figure 5 ) together with the luciferase assay , we concluded that IMP3 decreases directly the mRNA stability of ULBP2 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13426 . 010Figure 6 . Post-transcriptional effects of IMP3 on ULBP2 mRNA assessed by luciferase assay .

( B ) The 3\u2018UTRs of ULBP 1 , 2 , 3 and CD247 ( as control ) were fused to the luciferase gene as shown in A and expressed in RKO cells transduced either with scrambled shRNA or with shIMP3 . 28\u2009hr after transfection of the luciferase vectors , luciferase activity was measured . The\u00a0results were normalized to empty vector control and statistics were performed based on data acquired for the control UTR ( CD247 ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13426 . 010 Next , we wanted to identify the binding site of IMP3 within the 3\u2019UTRs of ULBP2 . To narrow down the exact binding site , we decided to perform a continuous shortening of the ULBP2-3\u2019UTR . Out of the full length 3\u2019UTR of 535 base pairs , we generated\u00a0four short variants covering the range from 1\u2013100 , 1\u2013200 , 1\u2013300 , 1\u2013400 base pairs and compared it to the constructs with the complete 3\u2019UTR ( schematically shown in Figure 6C ) . We observed that the construct ranging from 1\u00a0to\u00a0100 base pairs yielded an equal ratio of luciferase activity in RKO shIMP3 and RKO shRNA scrambled ( Figure 6D ) . All other constructs , including the construct ranging from 1\u00a0to\u00a0200bp , had significantly higher luciferase activities in the IMP3 knockdown cells compared to the shRNA scrambled ( Figure 6D ) . Thus , we concluded that the binding site for IMP3 must be located between 100\u00a0and\u00a0200bp of the 3\u2019UTR of ULBP2 . In 2010 , Hafner et al . used PAR-CLIP technology to identify putative binding sites of RNA binding proteins and proposed the binding motif \u2018CAUU\u2019 for IMP3 equivalent to CATT on DNA level ( Hafner et al . , 2010 ) . This motif exists twice in the 3\u2019UTR ULBP2 , at the positions 161\u2013164 and 292\u2013295 of the 3\u2019UTR . Since we determined that the IMP3 binding site in the 3\u2019UTR of ULBP2 is located between 100 and 200 base pairs ( Figure 6D ) , we replaced by PCR the TT nucleotides of the CATT motif found at position 164/165 with GG yielding in CAGG ( schematically shown in Figure 6E ) . Consequently , the ULBP2-3\u2019UTR mutation abrogated the effect of IMP3-dependent luciferase activity ( Figure 6F ) completely . Therefore , we concluded from this assay that there is only a single binding site for IMP3 in the 3\u2019UTR of ULBP2 . Next , we tested the functional relevance of ULBP2 targeting IMP3 . To this end , we co-incubated primary activated bulk NK cells that express the activating receptor NKG2D with RKO , HCT116 and 293T cells expressing shIMP3 or a scrambled shRNA and performed NK cytotoxicity assays . We observed a significantly higher lysis of shIMP3-expressing RKO cells ( Figure 7A ) , HCT116 cells ( Figure 7B ) and 293T cells ( Figure 7C ) consistent with the increased surface expression levels of ULBP2 on RKO and HCT116 ( Figure 2E and Figure 4B ) and ULBP2 only on 293T ( Figure 4B ) . By using a blocking antibody for NKG2D , we demonstrated that the differences observed are due to NKG2D recognition since when NKG2D was blocked killing of the cells was almost identical . The observed drastic decrease in NK cell activation was remarkable taking the moderate shift of ULBP2 following knockdown into account . For that reason , effect of IMP3 on the remaining NKG2D ligands MICA and MICB ( MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A and B ) was investigated as well . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13426 . 011Figure 7 . Knockdown of IMP3 enhances NK cell-mediated killing of cancer cells in a NKG2D dependent manner . ( A-C ) Primary human NK cells were incubated with an isotype antibody ( left columns , \u03b1Isotype ) or with anti-hNKG2D monoclonal antibody ( right column , \u03b1NKG2D ) for one hour on ice before target cells \u2013 either transduced with a control shRNA or shIMP3 \u2013 were added . 35S released into the supernatant upon target cell lysis by NK cells , was assessed 3\u2009hr later ( A ) 35S release by RKO cells co-cultured with NK cells in the ratio 1:25 . *p=0 . 023 in student\u2019s t-test .

( C ) 35S release by 293T cells co-cultured with NK cells in the ratio 1:10 . *P=0 . 013 in student\u2019s t-test . All experiments were performed at least twice and one representative replicate is shown . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13426 . 011 To assess if IMP3 affects the expression of MICA and MICB , we stained RKO and 293T cells with IMP3 knockdown or a transduced scrambled control for expression of these NKG2D ligands . We found RKO to be negative for MICA but highly positive for MICB . In contrast , 293T cells express MICA but lack MICB expression ( Figure 8A ) . Interestingly , we observed an increase of about 50% for MICB following IMP3 knockdown in RKO ( quantified in Figure 8B ) , but no effect on MICA . We also validated these results by performing the rescue experiments of IMP3 in these cell lines . In agreement with the KD experiments MICB expression was reduced after the restoration of IMP3 expression in RKO cells and the no effect was seen regarding MICA ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . To further confirm that IMP3 affects MICB expression , we overexpressed this RBP in the parental RKO cell line . A dramatic reduction of MICB expression was observed ( Figure 8C ) and only about 20% of the original MICB expression remained ( Figure 8D ) . Consistent with our observations for the surface expression of MICB , we could also detect an elevation MICB , but not MICA , RNA levels in RKO cells following IMP3 knockdown ( Figure 8E ) . Surprisingly , we could neither detect a IMP3-dependent change in stability of the MICB mRNA using D-Actinomycin treatment ( Figure 8F ) nor IMP3-dependent effects on transcript stability , processing or translation efficacy that would be observed in a luciferase experiment ( Figure 8G ) . Consequently , we conclude that the IMP3 uses different mechanisms to affect mRNA and protein levels of ULBP2 and MICB . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13426 . 012Figure 8 .

Immunotherapy is at the forefront of current cancer research and treatment , with numerous and diverse approaches aimed at harnessing the immune system to fight cancer ( Rosenberg et al . , 2004; Rosenberg et al . , 2008; Weiner et al . , 2010; Mellman et al . , 2011; Pardoll , 2012 ) . Accordingly , understanding the regulation of stress-induced ligands has immense importance as they pose potential therapeutic targets on tumor cells . The stress-induced ligands that are bound by the activating receptor NKG2D seem to play a critical role in immune surveillance and immune escape . Tumors and viruses alike developed numerous mechanisms to avoid surface expression ( Seidel et al . , 2012; Salih et al . , 2002; Fuertes et al . , 2008; Nachmani et al . , 2009; Fernandez-Messina et al . , 2010; Nachmani et al . , 2010; Bauman and Mandelboim , 2011; Bauman et al . , 2011 ) and even to effectively suppress NK cells activity by the\u00a0release of soluble or exosomal NKG2D ligands ( Fernandez-Messina et al . , 2010; Kloess et al . , 2010 ) . A complete knowledge of the complex mechanisms that tightly regulate the expression of surface markers in health or completely deregulate the expression in disease is essential to decide about the application of current therapeutic strategies and for the development of new therapeutics which could increase surface expression of these proteins . In this study , we present a new mechanism of immune escape that is mediated by the well-established oncogene IMP3 . IMP3 is absent in almost all healthy , adult tissues . However , expression of IMP3 could be observed in several kinds of cancer like in colon carcinoma ( Li et al . , 2009; Lochhead et al . , 2012; Kumara et al . , 2015 ) , adenocarcinomas ( Bellezza et al . , 2009; Lu et al . , 2009; Gao et al . , 2014 ) , urothelial carcinomas ( Sitnikova et al . , 2008; Xylinas et al . , 2014 ) , lymphomas ( King et al . , 2009; Tang et al . , 2013; Hartmann et al . , 2012 ) or renal cell carcinomas ( Hoffmann et al . , 2008; Jiang et al . , 2006; Jiang et al . , 2008 ) . We demonstrate in several human cell lines of different origins that the knockdown of IMP3 up-regulates surface expression of the NKG2D ligand ULBP2 . Consequently , we observed inverse effects on this stress-ligand following the overexpression of IMP3 . We demonstrate a direct interaction of IMP3 with ULBP2 mRNA . IMP3 was precipitated with biotinylated ULBP2 3\u2019 UTR . We observed an increased half-life of ULBP2 mRNA transcripts and , consequently , elevated luciferase activity in absence of IMP3 . We also showed that only a single binding site for IMP3 in the 3\u2019UTR of ULBP2 at the position 161\u2013164 exists since its mutation abolished differences in IMP3-dependent luciferase activity . We tested the effect of IMP3 on ULBP2 in several cell lines using knockdown and overexpression of this oncogene . The effect on ULBP2 expression in RKO , HCT116 and 293T cells were in a comparable magnitude . The impact of IMP3 was capable of altering ULBP2 expression up to 35% in the cell lines tested . However , we also observed an effect of IMP3 on another stress-induced ligand , MICB . Higher expression levels of IMP3 correlated with a reduction of MICB mRNA and surface expression . In contrast to ULBP2 , we did not observe differences in half-life or a change in the luciferase activity in presence or absence of IMP3 for MICB . Also , the surface expression changes between knockdown and overexpression for ULBP2 and MICB varied tremendously: In the knockdown , the up-regulation of ULBP2 and MICB was more or less similar , but the IMP3 overexpression decreased only moderately ULBP2 expression , but drastically affected MICB expression . Thus , we concluded that the IMP3-dependant alterations in MICB expression are probably indirect . Most likely , IMP3 acts on a so far unidentified transcription factor or regulator that subsequently leads to alterations in MICB gene transcription . The identification and validation of this putative mediating factor requires further investigation which is beyond the scope of this manuscript . Finally , we assessed the functional significance in an in vitro system by co-culturing NK cells with RKO cells , HCT116 cells or 293T cells with or without IMP3 knockdown . For all knockdown cell lines , we observed higher killing compared to the cells with natural levels of IMP3 . The physiological significance of IMP3 in healthy , adult tissues is still not completely understood . Obviously , the widely held belief that IMP3 is a strictly oncofetal gene could be disproved by reports that showed expression both in testis and placenta of healthy individuals ( Li et al . , 2014; Hammer et al . , 2005 ) . The recent discoveries about the role in placental trophoblasts might also shed a light on the array of target genes that are known to be affected by IMP3 , for instant CD44 expression that is up-regulated by IMP3 is important in migration of trophoblasts within the placenta . Accordingly , the destabilization of ULBP2 mRNA and regulation of MICB expression described in this study might also protect trophoblasts in the placenta from NK cells , which are the most abundant population of lymphocytes present in the decidua during early pregnancy ( Varla-Leftherioti , 2005; S\u00e1nchez-Rodr\u00edguez et al . , 2011 ) . This assumption requires further experimental support; nevertheless , it would explain the protection of cancerous cells by IMP3 expression that we spotlighted . Although we could investigate a new effect of IMP3 , its role in carcinogenesis is still incompletely understood as well . Our knowledge about its multiple targets that are discovered up to now raise the hypothesis that the complexity of action of an oncogenic RNA-binding protein might exceed the complexity of classical oncogenes like cytosolic or receptor tyrosine kinases . Further research is required to elucidate additional target RNAs that this RNA-binding protein can regulate and to ultimately develop an inhibitor for IMP3 that prevents its impacts on tumor cells . For cancer therapy , IMP3 might be an excellent drug target due to its restricted occurrence in healthy tissues and its widespread occurrence in different kinds of cancer and especially in cases of unfavorable prognosis . In accordance with our results , an inhibition of IMP3 would - next to other potential benefits - lead to an elevated stress ligand expression and thereby enlighten recent approaches of NKG2D ligand-based cancer treatment , for instance , immunotherapy by Natural Killer cell infusion ( Locatelli et al . , 2013; Spear et al . , 2013 ) . \n All cells were cultivated in 37\u00b0C , >95% humidity and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM , Sigma , Israel ) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ( Sigma-Aldrich , Israel ) and addition of non-essential amino acids , L-glutamine , sodium pyruvate and penicillin/streptomycin according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction ( all Biological Industries , Israel ) . RKO is a human colon carcinoma cell line ( ATCC CRL-2577 ) , HCT116 is a human colorectal carcinoma cell line ( ATCC CLL-247 ) , 293T is a human cell line established from embryonic kidney ( ATCC CRL-3216 ) . All cells were directly received from the ATCC , Virginia , USA , therefore no further authentication was considered . Prior to transduction , cells were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination . All knockdown and overexpression cell lines showed good viability and proliferation . The interactions between RNA and RNA-binding proteins were analyzed by RNA affinity purification as previously described ( H\u00e4mmerle et al . , 2013 ) . In short , the 3\u2019UTRs of ULBP2 ( both sense and antisense ) was cloned into pBluescriptII vector . Additionally , a UTR of a control gene with similar length and GC-content ( GBP2 ) was used . In vitro RNA transcription was performed using the MEGAscript T7 transcription kit ( Life Technologies , CA , USA ) after linearization of the plasmids with PspOMI restriction enzyme ( Thermo Scientific ( Fermentas ) , MA , USA ) . Around 10 percent of totally incorporated UTPs were Biotin-16-UTPs ( GE Healthcare , UK ) . The biotinylated RNAs were coupled with streptavidin-sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare , UK ) and incubated with cytoplasmic extracts prepared from 80% confluent RKO cells for at least 12\u2009hr . After purification and elution of proteins that bound specifically to the RNAs , a SDS gel analysis was performed and specific bands detected with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 ( Sigma Aldrich , Israel ) . Specific bands were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry using either a LTQ Orbitrap or a Q Exative LC-MS/MS ( Thermo Scientific , Israel ) . Analysis was performed by the Smoler Proteomics Center , Haifa , Israel . Knockdown of IMP3 was executed with MISSION shRNA clones ( Sigma Aldrich , Israel ) for IMP3 in the vector pLKO ( MISSION clone: NM_006547 . 2-2284s21c1 with following sequence: CCGGTGTTGTAGTCTCACAGTATAACTCGAGTTATACTGTGAGACTACAACATTTTTG ) . IMP3 mRNA is targeted within the 3\u2019UTR ( 3\u2019 untranslated region ) . Lentiviruses were generated in 293T cells and used for transduction of RKO , 293T and HCT116 that express IMP3 as detected by Western Blot analysis . Next to the transduction of a shRNA specifically targeting IMP3 ( shIMP3 ) , a control vector containing a scrambled shRNA was transduced ( hairpin sequence: CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCGCTCGAGCGAGGGCGACTTAACCTTAGG ) . Transduced cells were selected using 2 . 5\u00a0\u00b5g/mL puromycin in DMEM for HCT116 and 293T cells and 3\u00a0\u00b5g/mL for RKO cells . The vector containing the coding sequence for IMP3 was a kind donation of Prof . Joel K Yisraeli ( Hebrew University , Jerusalem , Israel ) . The insert was transferred into a lentiviral vector and stably transfected into RKO cells . An empty vector served as control . The efficacy of the transduction could be determined using the GFP reporter on the vector . Using limiting dilution , a single RKO clone expressing high GFP was selected and used in all assays described . The overexpression was confirmed using Western Blot . In order to confirm the effects observed in RKO cells , IMP3 was over-expressed as well in HCT116 and 293T cell line without selection of GFP expressing cells . To rescue IMP3 expression in RKO and 293T , cells that stably express the shRNA targeting IMP3 were transduced with an empty vector as control or the vector containing the coding DNA sequence ( CDS ) of IMP3 . Since the shRNA against IMP3 targets the 3\u2019UTR of the mRNA , the overexpression using the CDS only can\u2019t be targeted and downregulated . Lysates of the various RKO , HCT116 and 293T cells were prepared and SDS gel electrophoresis was executed . Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane with the tank blot procedure and specific protein bands were detected using antibodies detecting IMP3 ( sc-47893 , Santa Cruz , TX , USA ( 1:200 in 5% BSA in PBS ) and 07\u2013104 , Millipore , MA , USA [1:2000 in 5% BSA in PBS] ) or GAPDH ( Santa Cruz , TX , USA [1:1000 in 5% BSA in PBS] ) or Vinculin ( Abcam , UK , [1:1000 in 5% BSA in PBS] ) as loading control . Chemiluminesce caused by detection antibody-linked horse-reddish peroxidase ( HRP , Jackson ImmunoResearch , PA , USA ) was detected . For Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting ( FACS ) staining of NKG2D ligands on RKO cells , 3 x 105 were seeded 18\u2009hr prior to analysis in 6-well plates . On the day of analysis , cells were diluted in FACS buffer ( PBS , 1% BSA , 0 . 05% NaN3 ) and about 1 x 105 cells were stained with 0 . 25\u00a0\u00b5g of the antibody of interest for 1 hr . The cells were always analyzed in a confluence of about 60\u201380% . Anti-hULBP1 , anti-hULBP2 , anti-hULBP3 , anti-MICA and anti-MICB antibodies were obtained from R&DSystems ( MN , USA ) as well as the mouse isotype IgG antibody . For detection , a goat-anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 647 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , PA , USA ) was incubated in a dilution of 1:250 for 1 hr . Analysis was performed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences , CA , USA ) . Cells were gated according to their appearance in forward and side scatter ( FSC/SSC ) ; to analyze the effects of the overexpression of IMP3 on stress-ligand expression , only GFP-positive cells were gated ( both for the overexpression and the rescue of IMP3 after knockdown in RKO and 293T ) . RNAs for the detection of mRNA levels were prepared using the QuickRNA Kit ( Zymo Research , CA , USA ) . For the generation of cDNA , M-MLV reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) was used in the\u00a0presence of anchored Oligo dT primers ( Thermo Scientific ( Fermentas ) , MA , USA ) . Both procedures were performed according to manufacturers\u2019 protocols . For quantitative Real Time-PCR , freshly prepared cDNAs were used for SYBR Green-based detection in a QuantStudio 12k Flex Real-time PCR cycler ( Life Technologies , CA , USA ) with primers targeting GAPDH , HPRT , ULBP1 , ULBP2 , ULBP3 , IMP3 , MICA and MICB .

The vector contains a SV40 promoter replacing the natural gene promoter and a SV40 polyadenylation site . 1 . 25 x 105 RKO cells transfected with scrambled or IMP3-specific shRNA were seeded into 24-well-plates . The next day , the cells were transfected using TransIT-LT1 reagent ( MIRUS Bio , WI , USA ) with 250\u00a0ng of Firefly-Luciferase vector containing the 3\u2019UTRs , and 50\u00a0ng of Renilla Luciferase vector ( pRL-CMV ) as reference . 28\u2009hr post transfection , cells were lysed and luciferase activity measured using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System ( Promega , WI , USA ) . For the assessment of differences of luciferase activity of the shortened 3\u2019UTRs of ULBP2 , following UTRs were cloned into pGL3: 1\u2013100 bp ( basepairs ) , 1\u2013200 bp , 1\u2013300 bp , 1\u2013400 bp and full length UTR ( 540 bp ) . 1 x 105 RKO cells were seeded and the following day transfected with constructs coding for these shortened UTRs . Cells were harvested and analyzed 28\u2009hr post transfection . For the binding site analysis of IMP3 in ULBP2-3\u2019UTR , the putative-binding motif CATT at position 162 \u2013 165 was mutated into CAGG to prevent binding of IMP3 to the RNA . 1\u00a0x\u00a0105 RKO cells were transfected with the unchanged , wild type UTR of ULBP2 or the CAGG-mutated UTR and harvested 28\u2009hr post transfection . The empty vector pGL3 was used as control and for normalization . For the readout , a LB 940 Mithras device ( Berthold Technologies , Germany ) was used . For technical reasons , the device needed to be exchanged between the performance of Figure 6B and Figure 6D/Figure 6F . For the transcription inhibition with D-Actinomycin , RKO cells transfected with a scrambled or IMP3 specific shRNA were seeded in a density of 2 . 5 x 105 in 6-well-plates . The next day , medium was exchanged to fresh DMEM containing either 5\u00a0\u00b5g/mL D-Actinomycin ( Sigma Aldrich , Israel ) or equal volume DMSO as diluent control . D-Actinomycin effectively inhibits the elongation process of the RNA polymerase II , thereby suppressing the synthesis of new mRNA transcripts ( Sobell , 1985 ) . After 16\u2009hr incubation , medium was removed , and cells were harvested following the manufacturers\u2019 protocol for RNA extraction ( Zymo Research , CA , USA ) . cDNA was prepared using M-MLV reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen , CA , USA ) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol . qRT-PCR was performed as mentioned in the corresponding section . For analysis , we defined the level of a specific mRNA in the DMSO-treated control cells ( diluent control ) in both the scrambled shRNA- and shIMP3-transduced cells as 1 . By calculating the ratio of mRNA level after 16\u2009hr D-Actinomycin treatment and 16\u2009hr DMSO treatment , we assessed the rate of mRNA decay in dependence of IMP3 . NK cells were purified from whole blood of healthy donors via MACS separation ( Miltenyi Biotec , Germany ) . Separated NK cells were activated by co-cultivation with 50 000 irradiated PBMCs of two autologous donors , 5 000 irradiated 8866 B cell lymphoma cells and 0 . 2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL phytohemagglutinin ( PHA , DYN diagnostics , Israel ) . NK cells were further cultivated for three weeks in IL-2 containing medium . For the 35S release assay , 2 x 105 of the transduced RKO , HCT116 and 293T cells were labeled with 1\u00a0\u00b5Ci/mL EasyTag L-[35S]-Methionine ( Perkin Elmer , Israel ) in methionine-free RPMI for about 12\u2009hr . After removing excess labeling solution , NK cells were co-incubated with the labeled RKO cells in the ratio 25:1 , with labeled HCT116 or 293T cells in the ratio 10:1 . Before the assay was set up , NK cells were blocked for 1 hr on ice with 1\u00a0\u00b5g IgG1 isotype control or a blocking NKG2D antibody . After about 3 hr co-cultivation of cells , plates were centrifuged to pellet cells and 50\u00a0\u00b5L of the supernatants were transferred to Optiplate-96-plates ( Perkin Elmer ) . 150\u00a0\u00b5L of Microscint-40 solution ( Perkin Elmer ) per well were added . The readout was performed using a MicroBeta2 device ( Perkin Elmer ) . The percentage of specifically lysed cells in a certain well was calculated according to following formula: [%] specific lysis = ( ( count \u2013 'spontaneous' ) / ( 'total' \u2013 'spontaneous' ) ) *100% . Spontaneous release was assessed by culturing labeled RKO cells without NK cells; total release was assessed by adding 150\u00a0\u00b5l 1M NaOH to RKO cells to lyse all cells . Unless stated otherwise , student\u2019s t-tests were applied for statistical analysis . P-values are stated in the corresponding figure legends . The statement 'replicate' defines a biological replicate meaning that cells between experiments were separately seeded and grown and antibodies were diluted discretely . The number of technical replicates within a biological replicate is one for FACS analyses and four for qRT-PCR analyses , luciferase experiments and 35S release assay ."}

So what evolutionary reasons lie behind such stark behavioral diversity in a single species ? What benefits are obtained by switching from one behavior to another ? Tan and Cheong have now developed a mathematical model that suggests an intriguing possibility: under conditions that would cause the extinction of both nomadic individuals and colonies , switching between these life strategies can enable populations to survive and grow \u2013 a counter-intuitive phenomenon called Parrondo\u2019s paradox . Parrondo\u2019s paradox says that it is possible to follow two losing strategies in a specific order such that success is ultimately achieved . For example , slot machines are designed to ensure that players lose in the long run . What the paradox says is that two slot machines can be configured in such a way that playing either slot machine will lead to financial disaster , but switching between them will leave the player richer in the long run . Most studies of similar phenomena suggest that switching between two \u2018losing\u2019 lifestyle strategies can only improve the chances of survival if the environment keeps changing in unpredictable ways . However , Tan and Cheong\u2019s model shows that this unpredictability is an unnecessary condition \u2013 paradoxes also occur when organisms form colonies that predictably destroy their habitat . The basic mechanism for survival is elegant . The organism periodically exploits its habitat as part of a colony , then switches to a nomadic lifestyle to allow the environment to regenerate . Through mathematical analysis and simulations , Tan and Cheong confirm that this strategy is viable as long as two conditions hold: that colonies grow sufficiently quickly when environmental resources are abundant; and that colonists switch to a nomadic lifestyle before allowing the resource levels to dip dangerously low . The results produced by Tan and Cheong\u2019s model help to explain how behavior-switching organisms can survive and thrive , even in harsh conditions . Further work needs to be done to adapt this general model to specific organisms and to investigate the possible evolutionary origins of behavior-switching lifestyles .", "source": "Organisms often exhibit behavioral or phenotypic diversity to improve population fitness in the face of environmental variability . When each behavior or phenotype is individually maladaptive , alternating between these losing strategies can counter-intuitively result in population persistence\u2013an outcome similar to the Parrondo\u2019s paradox . Instead of the capital or history dependence that characterize traditional Parrondo games , most ecological models which exhibit such paradoxical behavior depend on the presence of exogenous environmental variation . Here we present a population model that exhibits Parrondo\u2019s paradox through capital and history-dependent dynamics . Two sub-populations comprise our model: nomads , who live independently without competition or cooperation , and colonists , who engage in competition , cooperation , and long-term habitat destruction . Nomads and colonists may alternate behaviors in response to changes in the colonial habitat . Even when nomadism and colonialism individually lead to extinction , switching between these strategies at the appropriate moments can paradoxically enable both population persistence and long-term growth . \n Two sub-populations comprise our model: the nomadic organisms , and the colonial ones . In a\u00a0similar vein to habitat-patch models , organisms that exist in multiple sub-populations can be modelled as follows: ( 1 ) d\u2062nid\u2062t=gi\u2062 ( ni ) +\u2211jsi\u2062j\u2062nj-\u2211jsj\u2062i\u2062niwhere ni is the size of sub-population i , gi is the function describing the growth rate of ni in isolation , and si\u2062j is the rate of switching to sub-population i from sub-population j . Population sizes are assumed to be large enough that Equation 1 adequately approximates the underlying stochasticity . Let n1 be the nomadic population size . In the absence of behavioral switching , the nomadic growth rate is given by ( 2 ) g1\u2062 ( n1 ) =-r1\u2062n1where r1 is the nomadic growth constant . Nomadism is modelled as a losing strategy by setting \u2212r1\u00a0<\u00a00 , such that n1 decays with time . In the context of Parrondo\u2019s paradox , nomadism corresponds to the \u2018agitating\u2019 strategy , or Game A . Importantly , competition among nomads , as well as between nomads and colonists , is taken to be insignificant , due to the independence of a nomadic lifestyle . Colonial population dynamics will be modelled by the well-known logistic equation , with carrying capacity K , but with two important modifications . Firstly , the Allee effect is taken into account . This serves two roles: it captures the cooperative effects that occur among colonial organisms , and it ensures that the growth rate is negative when the population falls below a critical capacity A . Let n2 be the colonial population size . In the absence of behavioral switching , the colonial growth rate is given by ( 3 ) g2 ( n2 ) =r2n2 ( n2min ( A , K ) \u22121 ) ( 1\u2212n2K ) where r2 is the colonial growth constant . Setting r2>0 , we have a positive growth rate when A<n2<K , and a negative growth rate otherwise . The min ( A , K ) term ensures that when K<A , g2 is always zero or negative , as would be expected . Secondly , the carrying capacity K changes at a rate dependent upon the colonial population size , n2 , accounting for the destruction of environmental resources over the long run . The rate of change of K with respect to t\u00a0is given by ( 4 ) d\u2062Kd\u2062t=\u03b1-\u03b2\u2062n2where \u03b1>0 is the default growth rate of K , and \u03b2>0 is the per-organism rate of habitat destruction . An alternative interpretation of this equation is that K , the short-term carrying capacity , is dependent on some essential nutrient in the environment , and that this nutrient is slowly depleted over time at a rate proportional to \u03b2\u2062n2 . Let n*=\u03b1\u03b2 , the critical population level at which no habitat destruction occurs . d\u2062Kd\u2062t is zero when n2=n* , positive when n2<n\u2217 , and negative when n2>n\u2217 . n\u2217\u00a0can thus also be interpreted as the long-term carrying capacity . Clearly , if the long-term carrying capacity n*<A , the only stable point of the system becomes n2=0 . Under this condition , colonialism is a losing strategy as well . Note that g2 increases as K increases , and that K increases more quickly as n2 decreases . In the context of Parrondo\u2019s paradox , colonialism can thus serve as a \u2018ratcheting\u2019 strategy , or Game B , because the rate of growth is implicitly dependent upon the colonial population in the past . Another way of understanding the \u2018ratcheting\u2019 behavior is through the lens of positive reactivity ( Williams and Hastings , 2011; Hastings , 2001 , Hastings , 2004 ) . In the short-term , n2=A is a positively reactive equilibrium , because small upwards perturbations of n2 away from A will result in rapid growth towards K before a slow decrease back down towards A . Organisms are able to detect the amount of environmental resources available to them , and by proxy , the carrying capacity of the population . Thus , they can undergo behavioral changes in response to the current carrying capacity . Here , we model organisms that switch to nomadic behavior from colonial behavior when the carrying capacity is low ( K\u00a0<\u00a0L1 ) , and switch to colonial behavior from nomadic behavior when the carrying capacity is high ( K\u00a0>\u00a0L2 ) , where L1\u2264L2 are the switching levels . Let rs\u00a0>\u00a00 be the switching constant . Using the notation from Equation 1 , switching rates can then be expressed as follows: ( 5 ) s12={rsif\u00a0K\u00a0<\u00a0L10otherwises21={rsif\u00a0K\u00a0>\u00a0L20otherwise A variety of mechanisms might trigger this switching behavior in biological systems . For example , since the nomadic organisms are highly mobile , they could frequently re-enter their original colonial habitat after leaving it , and thus be able to detect whether resource levels are high enough for recolonization . It should also be noted that the decision to switch need not always be \u2018rational\u2019 ( i . e . result in a higher growth rate ) for each individual . Switching behavior could be genetically programmed , such that \u2018involuntary\u2019 individual sacrifice ends up promoting the long-term survival of the species . Without loss of generality , we scale all parameters such that \u03b1=\u03b2=1 . Equation 4 thus becomes: ( 6 ) d\u2062Kd\u2062t=1-n2 Hence , n*=\u03b1\u03b2=1 . All other population sizes and capacities can then be understood as ratios with respect to this critical population size . Additionally , since \u03b2=1 , r1 , r2 and rs can be understood as ratios to the rate of habitat destruction . For example , if r2\u226b1 , this means that colonial growth occurs much faster than habitat destruction . Time-scale separation between the population growth dynamics and the habitat change dynamics can thus be achieved by setting r1 , r2\u226b1 . Similarly , the\u00a0separation between the behavioral switching dynamics and the population growth dynamics can be achieved by setting rs\u226br1 , r2 . \n As described earlier , both nomadic and colonial behaviors can be modelled as losing strategies given the appropriate parameters . Simulations across a range of parameters elucidated the conditions which resulted in extinction for both strategies . Figure 1a shows an example when both strategies are losing , resulting in extinction , while Figure 1b shows an example where only the colonial sub-population survives . It is clear from Equation 2 that the growth rate of the nomadic population n1 is always negative , because of the restriction that r1 >\u00a00 . Hence , nomadism is always a losing strategy . However , the conditions under which colonial behavior is a losing strategy are more complicated . Complex dynamics occur when the critical capacity A is just below 1 that can result in either survival or extinction . Nonetheless , it can be shown that when A\u00a0>\u00a01 , extinction occurs ( as in Figure 1a ) , and that survival is only possible when A is significantly less than 1 ( as in Figure 1b ) . That is: ( 7 ) A>1 ( colonial\u00a0extinction\u00a0guaranteed ) ( 8 ) A<1 ( colonial\u00a0survival\u00a0possible ) The intuition behind this is straightforward . Suppose that initially , A\u00a0<\u00a0n2\u00a0<\u00a0K , so that the growth rate is positive . When A\u00a0<\u00a01 , the colonial population n2 increases until it reaches the carrying capacity K , following which they converge in tandem until stabilizing at the critical population size , n2=K=1 . However , when A\u00a0>\u00a01 , n2=K=1 is no longer a stable equilibrium , since dn2/dt\u00a0<\u00a00 when n2\u00a0<\u00a0A , resulting in the eventual extinction of the population . For a formal proof , refer to Theorem A . 3 . We now restrict our analysis to the case where A\u00a0>\u00a01 . Under this condition , both nomadism ( Game A ) and colonialism ( Game B ) are losing strategies when played individually . Paradoxically , it is possible to combine these two strategies through behavioral switching such that population survival is ensured , thereby producing an overall strategy that wins . Simulation results over a range of parameters have predicted this paradoxical behavior , and also elucidated the conditions under which it occurs . Figure 2a is a typical example where the population becomes extinct , even though it undergoes behavioral switching , while Figure 2b is a typical example where behavioral switching ensures population survival . Conceptually , this paradoxical survival is possible because the colonial strategy , or Game B , is history-dependent . In particular , the colonial growth rate d\u2062n2/d\u2062t is dependent upon the carrying capacity K , which in turn is dependent upon previous levels of n2 . Behavioral switching to a nomadic strategy decreases the colonial population size , allowing the resources in the colonial environment , represented by K , to recover . Switching back to a colonial strategy then allows the population to take advantage of the newly generated resources . Because switching occurs periodically , as can be seen in Figure 2b , it should be noted that the organisms need not even detect the amount of resources present in the environment to implement this strategy . A biological clock would be sufficient to trigger switching behavior . The exact process by which survival is ensured can be understood by analysing the simulation results in detail . In the nomadic phase , the colonial population n2 is close to zero , the nomadic population n1 undergoes slow exponential decay , and the carrying capacity K undergoes slow linear growth . K increases until it reaches L2 , which triggers the switch to colonial behavior . The population thus enters the colonial phase . If the colonial population n2 exceeds the critical capacity A at this point , then n2 will grow until it slightly exceeds the carrying capacity K . Subsequently , n2 decreases in the tandem with K until K drops to L1 , triggering the switch back to the nomadic phase . However , if n2\u00a0<\u00a0A when the colonial phase begins , the colonial population goes extinct , as can be seen in Figure 2a . Hence , a basic condition for survival is that n2\u2265A at the start of each colonial phase . This implies that , by the end of the nomadic phase , n1 needs to be greater by a certain amount than A as well . Otherwise , there will be insufficient nomads to form a colony which can overcome the Allee effect . Under the reasonable assumption that the rate of behavioral switching is much faster than either colonial or nomadic growth ( rs\u226br1 , r2 ) , it can be shown more precisely that at the end of the nomadic phase , n1 needs to be greater than a critical level B , which is related to A by the equation: ( 9 ) A=B\u2212 ( 1\u2212B ) W0 ( B1\u2212BexpB1\u2212B ) A full derivation is provided in the Appendix ( Theorem A . 4 ) . Here , W0\u2062 ( x ) is the principal branch of the Lambert W function . Qualitatively speaking , B is a function of A on the interval ( 1 , \u221e ) that increases in an exponential-like manner , and that approaches 1 when A does as well . Thus , B\u2265A , as expected . The greater the difference between the switching levels , the longer the nomadic phase will last , because it takes more time for K to increase to the requisite value for switching , L2 . And the longer the nomadic phase lasts , the more n1 will decay . If , at the end of the nomadic phase , the value that n1 decays to happens to be less than B , then the population will fail to survive . It follows that there should be some constraint on the difference between the switching levels L1 and L2 . Under the same assumption that rs\u226br1 , r2 , such a constraint can be derived: ( 10 ) L2\u00a0<\u00a0L1+1r1ln\u2061L1+W0 ( \u2212L1e\u2212L1 ) B Survival is ensured given the following additional condition: ( 11 ) There\u00a0exists\u00a0t\u2217\u2265t0:n2 ( t\u2217 ) =K ( t\u2217 ) \u2265L1where t0 marks the start of an arbitrary colonial phase , and t* marks the time of intersection between n2 and K during that phase . In other words , n2 has to grow sufficiently quickly during the colonial phase such that it exceeds both K and L1 before switching begins . This can be seen occurring in Figure 2b . In accordance with intuition , numerical simulations predict that this occurs when the colonial growth constant is sufficiently large ( r2\u226br1 ) , as can be seen in the Figures . ( The Figures also show that r1 close to 1 , but this is not strictly necessary . ) Collectively , Equations 10\u201311 are sufficient conditions for population survival . Mathematical details are provided in the Appendix ( Theorems A . 5 and A . 6 ) . Note that Equation 10 contains an implicit lower bound on L1 . Since L2\u2265L1 by stipulation , we must have ln\u2061[L1+W0 ( \u2212L1e\u2212L1 ) ]\u00a0>\u00a0ln\u2061\u00a0B\u00a0for survival . The following bound is thus obtained: ( 12 ) L1\u00a0>\u00a0BeBeB\u22121 On the other hand , under the assumptions made , there is no upper bound for L1 , and hence no absolute upper bound for L2 either . This suggests that given a sufficiently well-designed switching rule , K can grow larger over time while ensuring population survival . Such a rule is investigated in the following section . Suppose that , in addition to being able to detect the colonial carrying capacity , nomads and colonists are able to detect or estimate their current population size . This might happen by proxy , by communication , or by built-in estimation of the time required for growth or decay to a certain population level . The following switching rule then becomes possible: ( 13 ) When\u00a0n2=K , dn2/dt\u00a0>\u00a00 , set\u00a0L1=K , L2=\u221eWhen\u00a0n1=B , dn1/dt\u00a0<\u00a00 , set\u00a0L2=K That is , L1 is set to the carrying capacity K whenever n2 rises to K , resulting immediately in a switch to nomadic behavior , and that L2 is in turn set to K whenever n1 falls to B , resulting in an immediate switch to colonial behavior . This switching rule is optimal according to several criteria . Firstly , by switching to nomadic behavior just as n2 reaches K , it ensures that d\u2062n2/d\u2062t\u22650 for the entirety of the colonial phase . As such , it avoids the later portion of the colonial phase where K and n2 decrease in tandem , and maximizes the ending value n2 . Consequently , it also maximizes the value of n1 at the start of each nomadic phase . Furthermore , by switching to colonial behavior right when n1 decays to B , the rule maximizes the duration of the nomadic phase while ensuring survival . This in turn means that the growth of K is maximized , since the longer the nomadic phase , the longer that K is allowed to grow . In fact , this switching rule is a paradigmatic example of how Parrondo\u2019s paradox can be achieved . It plays Game A , the nomadic strategy , for as long as possible , in order to maximize K and hence the returns from Game B . And then it switches to Game B , the colonial strategy , only for as long as the returns are positive ( dn2/dt\u00a0>\u00a00 ) , thereby using it as a kind of ratchet . Suppose that K grows more during each nomadic phase than it falls during each colonial phase . Then the switching rule is not just optimal , but it also enables long-term growth . Simulation results predict that this can indeed occur . Figure 3a shows long-term growth of K from t=0 to t=10 , while Figure 3b shows that with the same initial conditions , this continues until t=300 with no signs of abating . Together with K , the per-phase maximal values of n1 and n2 increase as well . In the cases shown , long-term growth is achieved because K indeed grows more during each nomadic phase than it falls during the subsequent colonial phase . As can be seen from Figure 3a , this is , in turn , because the nomadic phase lasts much longer than the colonial phase , such that the amount of environmental destruction due to colonialism is limited . Simulation results predict that this generally occurs as long as the colonial growth rate is sufficiently large ( r2\u226br1 ) . An interesting phenomenon that can be observed from Figure 3b is how the nomadic population size n1 , which peaks at the start of each nomadic phase , eventually exceeds the carrying capacity K , and then continues doing so by increasing amounts at each peak . This is , in fact , a natural consequence of the population model . When n2 grows large , the assumption that switching is much faster than colonial growth starts to break down . This occurs even though rs\u226br2 , due to the increasing contribution of the ( n2A-1 ) factor in Equation 3 . The result is that when a large colonial population begins switching to nomadism , a significant number of colonial offspring are simultaneously being produced . These offspring also end up switching to a nomadic strategy , resulting in more nomadic organisms than there were colonial organisms before . A particularly pronounced example of this is shown in Figure 4 . However , this same phenomenon also introduces a\u00a0limiting behavior to the pattern of long-term growth . As Figure 5 shows , when the same simulation as in Figure 3a and b is continued to t=1000 , peak levels of n1 , n2 and K eventually plateau around t=650 . This occurs because sufficiently high levels of n2 cause a qualitative change in the dynamics of behavioral switching . Normally , switching to nomadic behavior starts when K falls below L1 , and ends when K rises above it again . K rises towards the end of the switch , when n2 levels fall below the critical level of n*=1 . But when n2 is sufficiently large , the faster production of colonial offspring drags out the duration of switching , as seen in Figure 4 . The higher levels of n2 , combined with the longer switching duration , causes an overall drop in K by the end of the switching period . Because the increase in K during the subsequent nomadic phase is unable to overcome this drop , K stops increasing in the long-run . Nonetheless , it is clear that significant long-term gains can be achieved via the optimal switching rule . Under the conditions of fast colonial growth and even faster switching ( rs\u226br2\u226br1\u22431 , as in Figures 3a\u20135 ) , these gains are several orders of magnitude larger than the initial population levels , a huge departure from the long-term extinction that occurs in purely colonial or nomadic populations . Limiting behavior eventually emerges , but this is to be expected in any realistic biological system . Our proposed model is convenient for the functional understanding of growth and survival , and can be easily modified for a variety of applications . Additional constraints can be imposed under which survival and long-term growth are still observed . For example , in many biological systems , the dynamics of habitat change might occur on a slower timescale than both colonial and nomadic growth ( i . e . r1 , r2\u226b1 ) . Figure 6 shows the simulation results when this timescale separation exists ( r1=10 , r2=100 for ( a ) , r1=100 , r2=1000 for ( b ) ) . It can clearly be seen that survival is still possible under such conditions . Another practical constraint that can be imposed is limiting the growth of the carrying capacity to some maximal value Kmax , capturing the fact that the resources in any one habitat do not grow infinitely large . This can be achieved by modifying Equation 6 as follows: ( 14 ) dKdt= ( 1\u2212n2 ) ( 1\u2212KKmax ) Figure 6 already takes this constraint into account , showing that survival through periodic alternation is achievable under both bounded carrying capacity and slow habitat change , as long as the maximum carrying capacity is sufficiently high ( Kmax=20 ) . As Figure 7 shows , even long-term growth is possible , under both fast habitat change ( Figure 7a ) and slow habitat change ( Figure 7b ) . In both cases , the carrying capacity K converges towards a maximum value as it approaches Kmax . \n The results presented in this study demonstrate the theoretical possibility of Parrondo\u2019s paradox in an ecological context . Many evolutionary strategies correspond to the strategies that we have termed here as \u2018nomadism\u2019 and \u2018colonialism\u2019 . In particular , any growth model that is devoid of competitive or collaborative effects is readily captured by Equation 2 ( nomadism ) , while any logistic growth model which includes both the Allee effect and habitat destruction can be described using Equations 3 and 4 ( colonialism ) . Many organisms also exhibit behavioral change or phenotypic switching in response to changing environmental conditions . By incorporating this into our model , we have demonstrated that nomadic-colonial alternation can ensure the survival of a species , even when nomadism or colonialism alone would lead to extinction . Furthermore , it has been demonstrated that an optimal switching rule can lead to long-term population growth . The switching rules which lead to survival and long-term growth are analogous to the periodic alternation between games that produces a winning expectation in Parrondo\u2019s paradox . If one views the carrying capacity K as the capital of the population , then it is clear that Equation 5 is a capital-dependent switching rule . By setting the appropriate amounts of capital at which switching should occur , survival and growth can be achieved . Survival is achieved by ensuring that Game A , or nomadism , is never played beyond the point where extinction is inevitable , that is , the point where n1 falls below the critical level B . Long-term growth is additionally achieved by ensuring that Game B , or colonialism , is only played in the region where gains are positive , that is , when A\u00a0<\u00a0n2\u00a0<\u00a0K such that dn2/dt\u00a0>\u00a00 . The history-dependent dynamics of Game B are thus optimally exploited . Several limitations of the present study should be noted . Firstly , the study only focuses on cases where nomadism and colonialism are individually losing strategies , despite the abundance of similar strategies that do not lose in the real world . This is because assuming individually losing strategies in fact leads to a stronger result \u2013 if losing variants of nomadism and colonialism can be combined into a winning strategy , it follows that non-losing variants can be combined in a similar way too ( see Theorem A . 7 in the Appendix ) . Secondly , the population model does not encompass all variants of qualitatively similar behavior . For example , many other equations can be used to model the Allee effect ( Boukal and Berec , 2002 ) . Nonetheless , our proposed model is general enough that it can be adapted for use with other equations and be expected to produce similar results . Even the presence of the Allee effect is not strictly necessary , since the colonial population might die off at low levels because of stochastic fluctuations , rather than because of the effect . Theorem A . 7 in the Appendix also demonstrates that paradoxical behavior can occur even without the Allee effect causing long-term death of the colonial population . Thirdly , though it is trivially the case that pure nomadism and pure colonialism cannot out-compete a behaviorally-switching population , a more complex analysis of the evolutionary stability of behavioral switching is beyond the scope of this paper . Finally , spatial dynamics are not accounted for in this study . Exploring such dynamics is a goal for future work . \n Our comprehensive model captures both capital and history-dependent dynamics within a realistic ecological setting , thereby exhibiting Parrondo's paradox without the need for exogenous environmental influences . The possibility of an ecological Parrondo\u2019s paradox has wide-ranging applications across the fields of ecology and population biology . Not only could it provide evolutionary insight into strategies analogous to nomadism , colonialism , and behavioral diversification , it potentially also explains why environmentally destructive species , such as Homo sapiens , can thrive and grow despite limited environmental resources . By providing a theoretical model under which such paradoxes occur , our approach may enable new insights into the evolution of cooperative colonies , as well as the conditions required for sustainable population growth ."}

Animals have evolved the ability to form a 'map' or representation of their surroundings . For example , the electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus , is able to precisely learn the location of food and navigate there . It can do this in complete darkness by generating a weak electric field . As it swims , every object it encounters generates an \u2018electric image\u2019 that is detected on the skin and processed in the brain . However , all the cues the fish comes across are from its own point of view \u2013 the information about its environment is processed with respect to its location . And yet , the map that it generates needs to be independent of the fish\u2019s position \u2013 it has to work regardless of where the animal is . The way animals translate \u2018self-centered\u2019 experiences to form a general representation of their surroundings is not yet fully understood . Now , Wallach et al . studied how internal brain maps are generated in A . leptorhynchus . Information about the fish's environment passes through a structure in the brain called the preglomerular complex . Measuring the activity of this region revealed that the preglomerular complex does not process much self-centered information . Instead , whenever the fish passed any object \u2013 regardless of where it was in relation to the fish \u2013 the event triggered a brief burst of preglomerular activity . The intensity of the activity depended on how recently the fish had encountered another object . This information , combined with the dynamics of the fish's movement , could be what allows the fish to convert a sequence of encounters into a general spatial map . These findings could help to inform research on learning and navigation . Further research could also reveal whether other species , including humans , generate their mental maps in a similar way . This may be relevant for people suffering from diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s , in which a sense of orientation has become impaired .", "source": "Learning the spatial organization of the environment is essential for most animals\u2019 survival . This requires the animal to derive allocentric spatial information from egocentric sensory and motor experience . The neural mechanisms underlying this transformation are mostly unknown . We addressed this problem in electric fish , which can precisely navigate in complete darkness and whose brain circuitry is relatively simple . We conducted the first neural recordings in the preglomerular complex , the thalamic region exclusively connecting the optic tectum with the spatial learning circuits in the dorsolateral pallium . While tectal topographic information was mostly eliminated in preglomerular neurons , the time-intervals between object encounters were precisely encoded . We show that this reliable temporal information , combined with a speed signal , can permit accurate estimation of the distance between encounters , a necessary component of path-integration that enables computing allocentric spatial relations . Our results suggest that similar mechanisms are involved in sequential spatial learning in all vertebrates . \n Learning to navigate within the spatial organization of different habitats is essential for animals\u2019 survival ( Geva-Sagiv et al . , 2015 ) . Electric fish , for example , occupied a lucrative ecological niche by evolving the ability to navigate and localize food sources in complete darkness using short-range electrosensation ( Jun et al . , 2016 ) . The spatial acuity that they exhibit , along with their reliance on learned landmark positions , strongly suggest that they memorize the relative arrangement of the landmarks and the environmental borders . The information animals use to generate such allocentric knowledge include sensory experiences collected during object encounters ( Jun et al . , 2016; Petreanu et al . , 2012; Save et al . , 1998 ) and motor actions ( heading changes and distance traveled ) executed between such encounters; utilization of these motor variables in spatial learning and navigation is termed path integration ( Collett and Graham , 2004; Etienne and Jeffery , 2004 ) . This acquired information , however , is always egocentric in nature . Fittingly , the primary brain regions dedicated to sensory and motor processing , such as the optic tectum ( OT ) of all vertebrates and many cortical regions in mammals are topographically organized along an egocentric coordinate system ( Knudsen , 1982; Sparks and Nelson , 1987; Stein , 1992 ) . Unravelling the neural operations underlying the transformation of egocentric sensory and motor information streams into an allocentric representation of the environment has been a central theme in studies of spatial learning and navigation . Recent studies in the mouse ( Peyrache et al . , 2017 ) have suggested that the key computations include vestibular input that defines the animal\u2019s head direction ( head direction cells , egocentric ) and external sensory input that signals the presence of stable environmental features ( i . e . , landmarks ) . Linking the head directions that orient the animal to different environmental features are then hypothesized to generate an allocentric representation of those features . The neural circuits that have been hypothesized to implement these computations are , however , exceedingly complicated and include thalamic ( head direction ) and cortical ( external sensory ) input to the hippocampal formation . The proposed wiring diagrams are highly speculative and very far from providing a well-defined mechanistic model of how spatial maps are created . Equivalent computations appear to be carried out in Drosophila ( Seelig and Jayaraman , 2015 ) . Visual orientation to landmarks and body direction via path integration are combined in the ellipsoid body with dynamics suggestive of a ring attractor . While these studies in the simpler nervous system of the fly are now closer to providing a mechanistic explanation of how egocentric and external ( visual ) inputs are combined , it is not clear if the fly has a full representation of the allocentric relations of different environmental features . It is also not at all clear that the dynamics of the ellipsoid body can be mapped onto the cortical and hippocampal circuitry of mammals . Teleost fish offer an attractive model for studying this question , as their related brain circuitry is relatively tractable: lesion studies point to the dorsolateral pallium ( DL ) as the key telencephalic region required for allocentric spatial learning ( Broglio et al . , 2010; Dur\u00e1n et al . , 2010; Rodr\u00edguez et al . , 2002 ) , similarly to the medial cortex in reptiles and the hippocampus in mammals ( see Discussion ) . DL has strong excitatory recurrent connectivity ( Elliott et al . , 2017; Giassi et al . , 2012b ) . Importantly , DL receives sensory and motor information related to electrosensory and visual object motion from OT ( Bastian , 1982 ) via a single structure \u2013 the diencephalic preglomerular complex ( PG , Giassi et al . , 2012b , Figure 1A ) . The tectal recipient portion of PG projects solely to DL ( Giassi et al . , 2012a ) in agreement with the lesion studies . Importantly , PG receives very little feedback from areas associated with DL ( Giassi et al . , 2012b ) and therefore functions as an exclusive feed-forward bottleneck between OT and the pallium . DL in turn projects to the central pallium ( DC , Giassi et al . , 2012b ) ; DL also has reciprocal connections with the dorsal pallium ( DD ) and DD itself has strong recurrent connectivity . DC is the only route by which DL can control motor activity and it does so solely via its projections to the OT ( Giassi et al . , 2012b ) . We hypothesize that egocentric object-related information ( OT ) conveyed by PG to DL , is converted to a learned allocentric spatial map by the recurrent circuitry of DL , DD and DC; DC , in turn , then controls the fish\u2019s spatial behavior via its projections to OT . \n We first examined the spatial representation in PG cells by measuring their receptive fields ( RFs; measured in 27 cells ) . The OT electrosensory cells driving PG have spatially-restricted , topographically organized RFs ( Bastian , 1982 ) , and thus provide labeled-line information on the egocentric position of objects . In PG , by contrast , only 11% of the cells ( 3/27 ) were topographic with a spatially restricted RF ( Figure 2A ) ; the majority of PG cells ( 89% , 24/27 ) responded across most or all of the fish\u2019s body ( Figure 2B and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Therefore , PG activity does not convey a topographic \u2018labeled-line\u2019 code of object position . We also checked whether object location is encoded by the firing-rate of PG neurons ( i . e . , a rate code ) . The firing-rate was significantly correlated with object position only in one non-topographic cell ( 4% , 1/24 neurons; p\u00a0<\u00a00 . 05 , random-permutations test , Figure 2C ) . Similarly , mutual information between object position and firing-rate was significant only in two non-topographic cells ( 8% , 2/24 neurons; p\u00a0<\u00a00 . 05 , random-permutations test , Figure 2D ) . Therefore , almost all PG cells have whole-body RFs and lack topographic spatial information\u2013 the hallmark of all electrosensory regions from the sensory periphery up to OT . We attempted to systematically sample throughout the full extent of PG . However , we cannot absolutely determine whether the subset of topographic cells represent a small distinct sub-nucleus or are sparsely distributed throughout the PG complex . Next , we checked what information PG neurons convey about object motion . OT cells , which drive PG , respond to an object moved parallel to the fish ( longitudinal motion ) while the object traverses their RFs ( Bastian , 1982 ) . Only a minority of recorded PG units ( 26% , 7 out of 27 tested with longitudinal motion ) responded in this manner ( Figure 3A ) . Rather , the majority of PG units ( 78% , 20/27 ) exhibited a strikingly different behavior , emitting a brief burst response confined to the onset ( and sometimes to the offset ) of object motion , but not during motion itself ( Figure 3B ) . This is further demonstrated when motion in each direction was broken into four segments separated by wait periods ( Figure 3C ) , evoking responses at the onset ( yellow arrowheads ) and offset ( red arrows ) of each segment across the entire body . Interestingly , we have encountered several lateral-line responsive PG units that , unlike most of their electrosensory counterparts , did respond persistently throughout ( and even after ) object motion ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We next applied transverse motion , which mimics an object looming/receding ( incoming/outgoing ) into/from the electrosensory receptive field ( tested in 40 cells ) . Three types of responses to such motion were identified: proximity detection , encounter detection , and motion-change detection; 50% ( 20/40 ) displayed more than one type of response . Proximity detectors ( 75% , 30/40 ) responded when an object was encountered very close to the skin ( <\u00a02 cm , Figure 3D ) ; encounter detectors ( 32% , 13/40 ) responded when an object either entered to or departed from their electroreceptive range ( ~4 cm , Figure 3E ) ; lastly , motion-change detectors ( 57 . 5% , 32/40 ) displayed a response similar to that observed in longitudinal motion , firing at the onset/offset of motion ( i . e . , when the object accelerated/decelerated , Figure 3F ) ; remarkably , this type of response was relatively distance-invariant , yielding comparable responses both very close to ( 0 . 5 cm ) and very far from ( 5 . 5 cm ) the skin despite the drastic effects of distance on both the magnitude and spread of the object\u2019s electrical image ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 , see Chen et al . , 2005 ) . This discrete , nearly stereotypic response stands in contrast to the finely-tuned rate code of object distance previously reported in the primary electrosensory cells in ELL ( Clarke et al . , 2014; Clarke and Maler , 2017 ) . Taken together , the variety of PG response-types mentioned above may constitute a distributed representation of object proximity . Unlike the loss of egocentric topographic mapping discussed in the previous section , this representation does provide DL with coarse-grained , non-directional egocentric information . The possible role ( s ) of this information was not further considered in our analyses . We conclude that PG electrosensory cells predominantly respond to novelty: onset/offset of object motion within their receptive field or the introduction/removal of objects into/from this receptive field; we use the term object encounters to designate all such events . Most PG cells responded both to conductive and non-conductive objects ( Figure 4 ) and would therefore not discriminate between different object types , for\u00a0example , plants versus rocks . We can , therefore , infer that during active exploration of the environment , PG reports to the dorsal pallium whenever the fish encounters or leaves a prey or a landmark ( e . g . , root mass or rock ) or alters its swimming trajectory near a landmark . While topographic egocentric information was scarce in PG , temporal information was prevalent . Many of the PG cells exhibited pronounced adaptation to repeated motion ( 45% , 15/33 neurons tested with repeated-motion protocol; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We delivered a sequence of object encounters ( motions in and out of the RF , Figure 5A ) ; time-intervals between sequential encounters were drawn randomly and independently ( in the range of 1\u201330 s ) . The response intensity ( number of spikes within an individually determined time window ) of these adapting cells to each encounter was strongly correlated with the time-interval immediately prior to that encounter ( Figure 5B ) . By contrast , there was no significant correlation with intervals prior to the last one ( inset of Figure 5B and Figure 5C ) . Thus , a large subset of PG cells encoded the duration of the time-interval preceding the last encounter \u2013 but did not convey information about the intervals prior to that . We term this history-independent adaptation . Interestingly , similar behavior was also found in visually-responsive cells ( ventral PG , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . This result contrasts with many studies in the mammalian cortex , where adaptation is incremental and responses depend on multiple preceding intervals ( Lampl and Katz , 2017; Ulanovsky et al . , 2004 ) . Moreover , a spatial \u2018oddball\u2019 experiment ( Methods ) , which we conducted on 14 neurons ( 6 of which were adapting ) revealed that this adaptation is also spatially non-specific \u2013 that\u00a0is , encounters at one body location adapt the response to encounters at all other locations ( Figure 3D\u2013F ) . Therefore , this thalamic adaptation mechanism enables neurons to encode the time between the two most recent successive stimuli , without contamination by prior encounter history and irrespective of the objects\u2019 egocentric position . Can the sequence of time intervals between encounters be accurately decoded from the activity of the adapting PG cells ? To answer this question , we first constructed a simple model to describe the cells\u2019 response dynamics . This model assumes each cell\u2019s responsiveness is governed by a resource variable x\u00a0which is depleted following each encounter and recovers exponentially between encounters ( Tsodyks and Markram , 1997 ) . A parameter \u03b2\u00a0indicates the fraction of the resource remaining after depletion , while a time-constant \u03c4\u00a0sets the speed of recovery . The resource variable x\u00a0is converted into a firing rate variable \u03bb\u00a0using static rectification with a gain parameter a and baseline activity parameter c . Finally , each encounter generates a spike count according to a Poisson distribution with the current value of the rate parameter \u03bb ( Figure 6A ) . The parameter \u03b2\u00a0determines the extent to which past intervals in the sequence affect the current state ( Figure 6B ) . For instance , \u03b2=0 signifies complete exhaustion of the resource at each and every encounter . For such a cell , therefore , the firing rate increases monotonically as a function of the last time interval ( with the dependence taking the form of a saturating exponential function ) regardless of past intervals . In other words , \u03b2=0\u00a0indicates a completely history-independent cell , as defined above . As \u03b2\u00a0approaches unity the memory of past intervals becomes more dominant , for\u00a0example , a succession of short intervals will yield progressively weaker responses . All 15 adapting cells had statistically significant correlations between the responses and the fitted rate parameter {Tn} ( p < 0 . 05 , random permutations , see Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . Consistent with the results in the previous section , most adapting cells had an extremely low value of \u03b2 ( see parameter distributions in Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) ; 33% of the cells ( 5/15 ) were best fitted with \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00 ( see example in Figure 5B ) , the median \u03b2\u00a0was 0 . 12 and only 13% ( 2/15 ) had\u00a0\u03b2>0 . 5 . Hence , most cells were indeed predominantly affected only by the very last time interval . The fitted recovery time-scales were in the range 2 . 6-25 . 3s ( see Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Note , however , that this largely reflects the range explored with our stimulation protocol ( 1-30s intervals ) ; it is quite probable that PG contains faster cells ( i . e . , with \u03c4<1s ) that appear to be \u2018non-adapting\u2019 under this protocol , as well as slower cells ( i . e . , with \u03c4>30s ) that quickly cease responding and were therefore not recorded from . Using this model , we simulated the response of a population of adapting PG cells to random interval sequences . A Maximum-Likelihood Estimator ( MLE , see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) was used to decode the most recent interval from the population response to each encounter . To demonstrate this approach , we used a homogeneous population of identical memoryless neurons ( \u03b2=0 ) . At intervals shorter than the cells\u2019 adaptation time-constant \u03c4\u00a0the MLE was approximately unbiased ( Figure 6C ) and saturated the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower error bound ( CRLB , Figure 6D ) . The error increased with the decoded time interval T and baseline spontaneous activity c and decreased with population size N and response gain a ( Figure 6E-G ) . Finally , we checked the effect of non-zero adaptation memory ( \u03b2>0 ) while still using the same memoryless MLE decoder ( constructed by fitting a memoryless model to the simulated responses ) . The estimation error and bias were nearly unchanged up to \u03b2=0 . 2 ( Figure 6H ) . We conclude that the response of the majority of PG adapting cells to an encounter can be used to estimate the time interval elapsed prior to that encounter , using a simple , memoryless decoder . It is important to note that the population model mentioned above assumes that the responses of individual cells are statistically independent given the interval sequence . This assumption may not hold in certain scenarios , such as the existence of a latent state variable ( e . g . arousal ) modulating the overall population responsiveness . Such correlations across the population , if not taken into account in the decoding algorithm , would degrade the estimation accuracy . One possible solution to this could be based on the population of non-adapting cells ( 55% , 18/33 ) which , by definition , are not significantly affected by the temporal pattern of stimulation but might be affected by such global modulations . Thus , this population may convey sufficient information to enable estimation of such confounding variables and correct the temporal estimation accordingly . Can PG activity be used to explain features of spatial behavior in freely-swimming electric fish ? To check this possibility , we must first measure the time-intervals being memorized by fish conducting a spatial learning task , as well as the error in the fish\u2019s estimation of these intervals . To this end we used previously published data from spatial learning experiments conducted in our lab ( Jun et al . , 2016 ) . In these experiments fish were trained to find food in a specific location in complete darkness . This was performed either with or without the aid of landmarks . Since only the short-range electrosense was available to the fish , they had to use path-integration from the encountered objects to the food location . In other words , the fish had to memorize the intervals/distances between these encounters in order to improve its behavioral performance and find the food more efficiently . Therefore , we measured the time-interval and the distance traveled by the trained fish from the last encounter with an object ( tank wall or landmark ) to the food in each trial , either with ( Figure 7A ) or without landmarks ( Figure 7B ) . As one might expect , these intervals were longer in the absence of landmarks ( Figure 7C ) . Next , in order to estimate the fish\u2019s temporal accuracy , we randomly performed \u2018probe\u2019 trials in which no food was present in the arena . In these trials the fish vigorously searched for the missing food around its estimated position . We measured the distance between the center of the searched area and the designated food location to obtain the fish\u2019s spatial error ( Figure 7D , with landmarks; Figure 7E , without landmarks ) . This error increased in the absence of landmarks as well ( Figure 7F ) . Dividing this error by the median velocity in each trial yielded the temporal error , that\u00a0is the error in the fish\u2019s estimation of the time elapsed between object encounters and the estimated food location ( Figure 7F , inset ) . Thus , this behavioral analysis yielded the relation between the memorized time-intervals and the estimation error of this variable in two different scenarios . PG is the only source of sensory information for the dorsolateral pallium ( DL ) , the likely site of spatial memory ( Rodriguez et al . , 2002 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that the history-independent adapting PG cells provide DL with one necessary component for path integration: the temporal sequence of object encounters ( the two other components are heading-direction and linear velocity ) . How many adapting PG cells are required to achieve the behavioral temporal acuity observed as described above ? We constructed a heterogeneous population model using the empirically obtained parameters ( \u03b2\u00a0was set to 0 for all neurons to simplify the simulations ) . This model was then stimulated at random time-intervals , which were then decoded from the population response using MLE . This estimation was approximately unbiased across the entire range tested ( Figure 8A ) . We compared the simulated estimation error , as well as the analytically computed CRLB for the heterogeneous population , to the behavioral temporal results obtained with and without landmarks ( Figure 8B ) . We also performed the comparison in spatial terms by using the fishes\u2019 average velocity to convert the model\u2019s results into units of distance ( Figure 8C ) . The simulated PG population yielded temporal and spatial estimation errors comparable to those displayed in behavior ( boxplots in Figure 8B , C ) , both with and without landmarks , using only ~500 adapting cells . The lateral subdivision of PG ( PGl ) , in which most motion-responsive cells were found , contains about 60 , 000 cells ( Trinh et al . , 2016 ) . Based on our data , we can estimate that over 9 , 000 of these are memoryless adapting cells ( a conservative estimate using only strictly history-independent cells with\u00a0\u03b2=0 , 5/33 or 15% ) . Thus , we hypothesize that the number of PGl cells is sufficient to attain the observed behavioral precision , even when additional encoding errors ( e . g . in heading and velocity estimation ) are taken into account . Taken together , our simulations suggest that time-interval encoding in PG can consistently account for the observed behavioral precision of spatial learning . It should be noted that the validity of this computational analysis relies on our ( admittedly simple ) model correctly capturing the neuronal response dynamics . Finer details , such as the inter-dependency between the model\u2019s various parameters , were not taken into account in this study . However , it seems reasonable to suggest that the plentitude of PGl cells provides a large margin of error to accommodate such extensions . \n Our results suggest the following space-to-time transformation scheme: PG derives a sequence of discrete novelty events ( encounters ) from OT activity . The remarkable history-independent adaptation process provides an accessible , accurate and unbiased representation of the time intervals between encounters . We have found visually-responsive PG cells displaying similar adaptation features ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , suggesting that this mechanism is implemented across multiple sensory modalities . The elimination of egocentric topographic information in PG \u2013 both in the response itself and in its adaptation \u2013 ensures that the encoding of time is invariant to the specific body part encountering the object . This temporal information is then transmitted to DL , which can use it to integrate the fish\u2019s swim velocity to obtain distance-traveled , a key allocentric variable . For fish , the necessary velocity information may be provided by the lateral-line system ( Chagnaud et al . , 2007; Oteiza et al . , 2017 ) ; several lateral-line responsive PG units were encountered in our recordings ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Finally , DL can combine the distance information with instantaneous heading-direction ( vestibular system , Straka and Baker , 2013; Yoder and Taube , 2014 ) to yield the animal\u2019s allocentric spatial position ( Etienne and Jeffery , 2004 ) . A recent study in zebrafish suggests that DL neurons can indeed process temporal information on the long time-scales discussed here ( Cheng et al . , 2014 ) . Our computational analysis demonstrates that the PG temporal information is sufficient to account for the spatial acuity displayed in behavioral studies of gymnotiform fish utilizing electrosensory information alone ( Figure 8 ) . This space-to-time mechanism may shed light on the primitive basis of egocentric-to-allocentric transformations . Short-range sensing , used by ancestor species living in low-visibility environments , necessitated the perception of space through temporal sequences of object encounters . With the evolution of long-range sensory systems such as diurnal vision ( MacIver et al . , 2017 ) , simultaneous apprehension of the spatial relations of environmental features became possible . The neural mechanisms implementing sequential ( space-to-time ) spatial inference and simultaneous spatial inference presumably both exist in mammals , for\u00a0example , we can acquire a map of relative object locations by looking at a scene from afar , or by walking and sequentially encountering landmarks with our eyes closed . Whether the sequential or the simultaneous spatial-inference is more dominant may depend on the species ( e . g . , nocturnal or diurnal ) and on context ( e . g . , open field or underground burrows ) . However , it is not clear whether sequentially versus simultaneously-acquired spatial knowledge is processed in a common circuit . Indeed , clinical case studies on the regaining of eyesight in blind humans indicate that sequential and simultaneous spatial perceptions are fundamentally different , and may therefore involve two distinct computations and neuronal pathways ( Sacks , 1995 ) . The population of thalamic neurons that we discovered may provide an essential component underlying one of these two major computations \u2013 the encoding of sequential temporal information \u2013 and we hypothesize that such neurons underlie sequential spatial learning in all vertebrates . There is substantial evidence indicating that the pathway studied here indeed has parallels in other vertebrates , and specifically in mammals . PG\u2019s homology to posterior thalamic nuclei is supported by previously published anatomical and developmental findings ( Giassi et al . , 2012a; Ishikawa et al . , 2007; Mueller , 2012 ) , as well as by physiological ( Figure 1B , C ) and molecular ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) results presented here . The thalamic pulvinar nucleus is particularly similar to PG in that it receives direct tectal input ( Berman and Wurtz , 2011 ) . Its involvement in visual attention and saliency in primates ( Robinson and Petersen , 1992 ) corresponds to PG\u2019s involvement in novelty detection ( Figure 2 ) . Moreover , pulvinar lesions are associated with saccadic abnormalities and deficits in the perception of complex visual scenes ( Arend et al . , 2008 ) , suggesting a link to the sequential mode of spatial learning . Komura et al . ( 2001 ) demonstrated that posterior thalamic regions ( including the rodent equivalent of the pulvinar ) can implement interval timing computations over long time-scales ( >>1 s ) ; however , the mechanistic basis for these computations has not been identified ( Simen et al . , 2011 ) and potential contributions to path integration have not been explicated . A recent paper ( Paton and Buonomano , 2018 ) reviewed models of temporal encoding based on recurrent neural networks . Further studies will be required to determine whether the novel adaptation encoding mechanism in PG engages the downstream recurrent networks of DD and DL to produce refined estimates of the time interval between salient sensory and/or motor events . Finally , a recent study in rodents demonstrated spatially non-specific adaptation in VPM ( Jubran et al . , 2016 ) , a posterior thalamic nucleus responding to vibrissal object encounters ( Yu et al . , 2006 ) . Taken together , we hypothesize that thalamic space-to-time mechanisms akin to those presented here play an important role in mammalian sequential spatial learning , especially in nocturnal animals relying on sparse sensory cues ( Save et al . , 1998 ) . The telencephalic target of PG , DL , resembles the mammalian hippocampus not only in function , as revealed in lesion studies ( Rodr\u00edguez et al . , 2002 ) , but also in development , gross circuitry and gene expression ( Elliott et al . , 2017 ) . The role of the hippocampus in spatial learning and navigation is well established , and hippocampal neural correlates of allocentric spatial variables have been exquisitely described ( Barry and Burgess , 2014; Buzs\u00e1ki and Moser , 2013 ) . There is also evidence for the importance of time coding in the mammalian hippocampus: \u2018Time cells\u2019 responsive to elapsed time have been reported and , in some cases , these cells also respond at specific spatial loci ( Eichenbaum , 2014 ) . Furthermore , a recent study on the representation of goals in the hippocampus found cells encoding the length/duration of the traveled path ( Sarel et al . , 2017 ) . The mechanism we have found may therefore contribute to creating temporal coding in the hippocampus , not just in the context of egocentric-to-allocentric transformations but rather whenever expectations associated with specific time intervals need to be generated . It should be noted , however , that unlike DL\u2019s direct thalamic input via the PG bottleneck , the hippocampus receives sensory and motor information primarily via the cortex . Furthermore , multiple bi-directional pathways connect the mammalian sensory and motor cortical regions with the hippocampal network . Pinpointing the exact loci where egocentric-to-allocentric transformations may take place in the mammalian brain is therefore extremely challenging . We propose that this transformation is initiated in the mammalian thalamus where history-independent adaptation also encodes time between encounter events . Finally , we propose that this thalamic output contributes to the generation of an allocentric spatial representation in the mammalian hippocampus . In this contribution , we propose a hypothesis about how gymnotiform fish , and perhaps vertebrates in general , generate their representation of position relative to the environment . Future experiments could test the predictions entailed by this hypothesis . Behaviorally , our model implies that the fish's sense of position is critically dependent on its last encounter with an object . Further behavioral studies of spatial learning could elucidate this relationship , for\u00a0example , by manipulating the objects' arrangement relative to the navigation target . Combining these studies with chronic recordings of PG and its pallial targets in freely navigating fish will permit testing of our proposed space-to-time neural transformation scheme . \n All procedures were approved by the University of Ottawa Animal Care and follow guidelines established by the Society for Neuroscience . Apteronotus leptorhynchus fish ( imported from natural habitats in South America ) were kept at 28\u00b0C in community tanks . Fish were deeply anesthetized with 0 . 2% 3-aminobenzoic ethyl ester ( MS-222; Sigma-Aldrich , St . Louis , MO; RRID: SCR_008988 ) in water just before surgery or tissue preparation . Surgery was performed to expose the rostral cerebellum , lateral tectum and caudal pallium . Immediately following surgery , fish were immobilized with an injection of the paralytic pancuronium bromide ( 0 . 2% weight/volume ) , which has no effect on the neurogenic discharge of the electric organ that produces the fish\u2019s electric field . The animal was then transferred into a large tank of water ( 27\u00b0C; electrical conductivity between 100\u2013150 \u03bcS cm\u22121 ) and a custom holder was used to stabilize the head during recordings . All fish were monitored for signs of stress and allowed to acclimatize before commencing stimulation protocols . Custom made stereotrodes or tritrodes were made of 25 \u03bcm diameter Ni-Cr wire ( California Fine Wires ) . Each electrode was manually glued to a pulled filamented glass pipette ( P-1000 Micropipette Puller , Sutter Instrument , Novato , CA ) ; the glass pipette provided mechanical rigidity that allowed advancing the tetrode to the deep-lying PG . Prior to recording , tetrode tips were gold-plated ( NanoZ 1 . 4 , Multi Channel Systems , Reutlingen , Germany ) to obtain 200\u2013300 kOhm impedance at 1 kHz . The electrode was positioned above the brain according to stereotaxic brain atlas coordinates ( 150\u2013300 \u00b5m caudal to T26 and 800\u20131000 \u00b5m lateral to midline [Maler et al . , 1991] ) , and lowered using a micropositioner ( Model 2662 , David Kopf Instruments , Tujunga , CA ) while delivering visual and electrosensory stimuli . Tectal responses to such stimuli ( Bastian , 1982 ) were usually detected twice , around 1200 \u00b5m and around 1900 \u00b5m ventral to the top of cerebellum ( as expected from the curved shape of OT ) . The electrode usually then transversed nucleus Electrosensorius , producing weak multi-unit responses to electrocommunication stimuli around 2300\u20132500 \u00b5m ( Heiligenberg et al . , 1991 ) . PG units were usually encountered between 2800 \u00b5m and 3400 \u00b5m ventral to the top of the cerebellum , and were easily identified due to their characteristic rapid spike bursts ( Figure 1B , C ) . Differential extracellular voltage was obtained by using one stereotrode/tritrode channel as reference . This enabled near-complete cancellation of the electric organ discharge ( EOD ) interference . We report on the responses of 84 PG neurons responsive to object motion; several motion protocols were used and the sample size for each protocol is mentioned in context . We also found PG cells responding to electrocommunication signals , mostly within the medial subdivision of PG ( PGm ) . As expected from the sparse retinal input to OT ( Sas and Maler , 1986 ) , we recorded only a small number ( n\u00a0=\u00a019 ) of PG cells responsive to visual input ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , mostly in more ventral portions of PG ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . In addition , we identified a small number of cells responsive to passive electrosensory ( Grewe et al . , 2017 ) ( ampullary receptors , n\u00a0=\u00a027 ) , acoustic ( n\u00a0=\u00a07 ) and lateral line ( n\u00a0=\u00a07 , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) stimulation \u2013 but did not attempt to further characterize their coding properties . Cell responses were initially manually tested with brass and plastic spheres . Cells responding to both were also tested with an electrically neutral gel ball made of 15% agarose in tank water to exclude lateral-line responses ( Heiligenberg , 1973 ) ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . A plastic or brass sphere ( 1 . 21 cm diameter ) was connected to an electromechanical positioner ( Vix 250IM drive and PROmech LP28 linear positioner , Parker Hannifin , Cleveland , OH ) , which was pre-programmed for the appropriate motion sequence and initiated by outputs from our data acquisition software ( Spike2 , Cambridge Electronic Designs , Cambridge , UK ) . Typically , a trapezoidal velocity profile was used with 150 cm/s2 acceleration and 5 cm/s peak velocity , and total distance in either direction of 8 cm ( longitudinal ) or 5 cm ( transverse ) ; due to technical limitations , each cell was recorded using only one direction of motion ( longitudinal or transverse ) . For protocols involving motion in two axes ( receptive field sampling , Oddball ) , the object was attached to a second electromechanical positioner ( L12-100-50-12-P linear actuator , Firgelli Technologies , Ferndale , WA ) , which was mounted perpendicularly to the first one . In order to measure the receptive field ( RF ) size , we used one motor to repeatedly perform transverse object motion ( towards and away from the fish ) while a second motor was used to randomly change the longitudinal position between repetitions . This protocol was performed on a total of 27 cells . To check the spatial specificity of the adaptation process ( i . e . if it is affecting only the body location experiencing the encounters or a whole-body effect ) , we performed a spatial oddball experiment: First , a series of N \u2018standard\u2019 encounters ( in and out transverse object motion , N\u00a0=\u00a05\u20139 ) were given in rapid succession at one location ( e . g . the head ) ; the ( N\u00a0+\u00a01 ) th encounter was given at a different location ( e . g . the trunk ) while maintaining the same time-interval between encounters ( 3\u20135 s , the second motor was used to quickly switch positions ) . Each such series was followed by a long recovery period ( \u2265\u00a030 s ) and then repeated in the opposite direction . This was performed on a total of 14 cells , out of which six were found to be adapting ( in either direction ) . In the initial experiments the location of PG was verified by preparing histological sections and locating the electrode track marks ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . After recordings were complete , the fish was deeply anesthetized using tricaine methanesulfonate ( MS-222 0 . 2 g/L; Sigma-Aldrich , St-Louis , MO ) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde , 0 . 1% glutaraldehyde , and 0 . 2% picric acid in 0 . 1 M PBS pH 7 . 4 . Brains were removed and incubated overnight in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde , 0 . 2% picric acid , and 15% sucrose in 0 . 1 M PBS pH 7 . 4 at 4\u00b0C . Cryostat sections were cut at 25 \u03bcm in the transverse plane and mounted on Superfrost Plus glass slides ( Fisher Scientific , Pittsburgh , PA ) . All sections were counterstained with green fluorescent Nissl reagent 1:300 ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR; NeuroTrace 500/525 green-fluorescent Nissl Stain #N21480 , RRID: SCR_013318 ) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature . Three adult male fish were anesthetized . Ice-cold ACSF was dripped on the head while the skull was removed and brains quickly removed and submerged in ice-cold ACSF . PG and DL brain regions were superficially located ( Maler et al . , 1991 ) , identified , dissected out and stored at \u221220\u00b0C . Tissues were weighted and total RNA was purified using Trizol ( Sigma-Aldrich ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations . Contaminating genomic DNA was digested with DNAse1 , total RNA was then precipitated overnight at \u221220\u00b0C , resuspended in nuclease-free water and quantified by spectroscopy . 300 ng of total RNA were used for first strand cDNA synthesis using the Maxima H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit ( K1681; ThermoFisher ) . PCR were made with the Taq polymerase ( EP0402; ThermoFisher ) according to manufacturer\u2019 recommendations for 35 cycles using the following primer pairs: G amplicon ( 301 bp ) , direct: 5\u2019-CGACACCTTCCGCAAAATCG-3\u2019 , reverse: 5\u2019-AGCACAGACAGACCTCCGc-3\u2019; H amplicon ( 338 bp ) , direct: 5\u2019-GGGACGATTTCAGGGACAGG-3\u2019 , reverse: 5\u2019-CACTCGCAGCAGACGGAA-3\u2019; I amplicon ( 355 bp ) , direct: 5\u2019-TGGGATGAGATTGGAG TGAAAC-3\u2019 , reverse: 5\u2019-AGCGGACCAGCTTAATGACC-3\u2019 . Amplicons were then migrated on a 1% agarose Et-Br gel and photographed with a BIO-RAD Gel Doc System . In all paired comparisons , the bootstrap method ( 5000 random redistributions without replacement ) was employed to estimate statistical significance . Random permutations were used to evaluate significance of correlations ( 5000 random permutations without replacement ) . Sample sizes were determined by statistical requirements , aiming at confidence levels\u00a0>\u00a095% . No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those generally employed in the field . No randomization or blinding was used is this study . The random interval protocol ( Figure 5A ) produced for each cell an interval ( input ) vector {Tn} and a spike count response ( output ) vector {Rn} ( count computed for each unit in a time-window determined by its response type , see Figure 3 ) . For some of the cells , a slow decline in response due to experimental instability was corrected by dividing the response time course by a least-squared fitted slow ( >\u00a010 min ) exponential decay . The model ( Figure 6 ) assumes each neuron has a latent state variable x\u00a0with dynamics following each encounter given byxn=1\u2212e\u2212Tn\u03c4 ( 1\u2212\u03b2xn\u22121 ) where Tn is the nth time interval in the sequence , \u03b2 is the memory coefficient ( 0\u2264\u03b2\u22641 ) and \u03c4\u00a0the recovery time-constant . Note that x\u00a0is always in the range [0 , 1] . Equation ( 1 ) is in fact the between-event , discrete-time solution of the standard resource-based depression model of Tsodyks and Markram ( Tsodyks and Markram , 1997 ) , where\u00a0\u03b2=1-UEI; we chose this formalization so that the extent of history-dependence in the adaptation dynamics will be emphasized ( i . e . , \u03b2=0\u00a0signifies complete history independence and history dependence increases as\u00a0\u03b2\u21921 ) . The neuron\u2019s firing parameter \u03bbn at the nth encounter is \u03bbn\u00a0=\u00a0axn+c+ , where a\u00a0>\u00a00 , c\u2208R and \u2219+ denotes non-negative rectification . Fitting of a and c was performed using linear least squares , while \u03b2 and \u03c4\u00a0were found by exhaustive search on a 2-D grid . Fitting was deemed successful if the parameter values generated by the model were correlated with the actual responses with P < 0 . 05 ( random permutations , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This was true for 15/33 cells . Note that when \u03b2=0 ( \u2018history-independent\u2019 adaptation ) , we get: ( 2 ) \u03bbn=[a ( 1\u2212e\u2212Tn\u03c4 ) +c]+ , which corresponds to the solid blue line in Figure 5B . Finally , {\u03c4n} were used as the parameters of Poisson random variables to generate stochastic spike-counts {Rn} , so that the number of spikes emitted at each encounter was distributed according to: ( 3 ) p ( Rn=k ) =\u03bbnk\u00a0e\u2212\u03bbnk ! , k=0 , 1 , 2 , 3\u2026 Now we assume a population of N history-independent ( \u03b2=0 ) neurons , with aj , cj , and \u03c4j are the individual parameters of the jth neuron and Rnj is its response to the nth encounter . We also assume that Rnjj=1N are independent Poisson random\u00a0variables ( r . v . \u2019s ) , with each r . v . distributed according to equation ( 3 ) . The likelihood of this population response is thereforeLTn|Rnj=PRnj|Tn=\u220fj=1Naj1-e-Tn\u03c4j+cj+Rnje-aj1-e-Tn\u03c4j+cj+Rnj ! , and the log-likelihood islTn|Rnj=\u2211j=1NRnjlog\u2061aj1-e-Tn\u03c4j+cj+-aj1-e-Tn\u03c4j+cj+-log\u2061Rnj ! . The Maximum-Likelihood Estimator of the last time interval is therefore obtained by finding the time interval Tn that maximizes this likelihood:TnMLE=argmaxTn>0 ( \u2211j=1NRnjlog ( [aj ( 1\u2212e\u2212Tn\u03c4j ) +cj]+ ) \u2212[aj ( 1\u2212e\u2212Tn\u03c4j ) +cj]+ ) . This maximum was found numerically for each generated time interval . To explore the coding properties of the model we used a population of N identical cells ( \u03c4j=\u03c4;\u00a0aj=a;\u00a0cj=c ) . Assuming for a moment\u00a0a ( 1\u2212e\u2212Tn\u03c4 ) +c>0 , the MLE for the population is the solution of: ( 4 ) dl ( Tn ) dTn=\u2211j=1Na ( \u22121\u03c4e\u2212TnMLE\u03c4 ) ( 1\u2212Rnja ( 1\u2212e\u2212TnMLE\u03c4 ) +c ) =0N-\u2211j=1NRnja1-e-TnMLE\u03c4+c=0a+c-1N\u2211j=1NRnj=ae-TnMLE\u03c4TnMLE=-\u03c4log\u2061a+c-1N\u2211j=1NRnja=\u03c4log\u2061aa+c-1N\u2211j=1NRnj One can easily show that this solution indeed maintains\u00a0a ( 1\u2212e\u2212TnMLE\u03c4 ) +c>0 . Note that when 1N\u2211j=1NRnj> ( a+c ) then TnMLE has no real solution ( i . e . , likelihood function has no finite maximum ) . In these cases , the estimator output is ignored . Since for\u00a0f ( X ) =log\u2061 ( 11\u2212x ) , E ( f ( X ) ) \u2260f ( E ( X ) the MLE is biased . However , if we assume T\u226a\u03c4 , then we can approximate:TnMLE\u2245\u03c41N\u2211j=1NRnj-cafor which:ERnjTnMLE\u2245\u03c4\u03bbn-ca= \u03c4axn+c-ca=\u03c41-e-Tn\u03c4\u2245Tn To compute the Fisher information for any time T>0 , recall the identity: I ( T ) =\u2212E{Rj}{d2l ( {Rj} , T ) dT2}=\u2212E{Rj}{ddT ( \u2211j\u2212aj\u03c4je\u2212T\u03c4j ( 1\u2212Rjaj ( 1\u2212e\u2212T\u03c4j ) +cj ) ) } , where the sum is restricted to those neurons with positive activity on that value of T , that\u00a0is , {j|j\u2208[1:N]\u2227aj ( 1\u2212e\u2212T\u03c4j ) +cj>0} . Therefore:I ( T ) =\u2212E{Rj}{\u2211jaj\u03c4j2e\u2212T\u03c4j ( 1\u2212Rjaj ( 1\u2212e\u2212T\u03c4j ) +cj\u2212ajRj ( aj ( 1\u2212e\u2212T\u03c4j ) +cj ) 2e\u2212T\u03c4j ) }=-\u2211jaj\u03c4j2e-T\u03c4j1-ERjaj1-e-T\u03c4j+cj-ajERjaj1-e-T\u03c4j+cj2e-T\u03c4j Since Rj are Poisson r . v . with rate\u00a0\u03bbj=aj1-e-T\u03c4j+cj:IT=\u2211jaj2\u03c4j2aj1-e-T\u03c4j+cje-2T\u03c4j For a homogeneous population ( Figure 6C\u2013G ) , this becomes:IT=a2N\u03c42a1-e-T\u03c4+c+e-2T\u03c4 Therefore , the CRLB ( assuming zero bias ) becomes:VarTmle\u2265\u2211jaj2\u03c4j2aj1-e-T\u03c4j+cje-2T\u03c4j-1 The set of parameter values obtained for all 15 fitted adapting cells ( a , c and \u03c4 ) were randomly drawn from to generate a bootstrap population of N cells ( N=100 , 500 and 2000 ) . Gaussian noise with standard deviation of 25% was added to the parameters to obtain smoother distributions . The memory variable \u03b2 was set to 0 for all cells to simplify simulations . We also assumed that spiking across the population was statistically independent with Poisson statistics given the last interval , that\u00a0is pRni , Rnj|Tn=pRni , |TnpRnj , |Tn\u00a0where Rni is the response of neuron i to time interval n . Random intervals were drawn in the range 1\u201330 s , and for each interval a vector of responses ( spike counts ) across the population Rnjj=1N was generated , where N is the population size . Published spatial learning data ( Jun et al . , 2016 ) were used; methods used for the generation of these data are explained in detail in that study . Briefly , South American weakly electric fish ( Gymnotus sp . ) were trained to find food ( a mealworm restrained to a suction cup ) in complete darkness , at a specific location within a 150 cm diameter custom made circular arena . In experiments with landmarks , four acrylic objects ( two square prisms , 5 . 6 and 9 . 0 cm/side and two cylinders , 7 . 6 cm and 10 . 2 cm diameter ) were placed in fixed locations within the arena . In each daily session , each fish was given four trials to find the food . After a 12-session training stage , animal performance stabilized , and four test sessions were performed in which food was omitted in one randomly assigned \u2018probe\u2019 trial . Only data from these four last sessions were analyzed here . A total of four fish were used with landmarks and eight fish were used without landmarks . Fish behavior was video recorded and tracked as previously described ( Jun et al . , 2014 ) . The cruising time/distance from the last encounter ( with either a landmark or the tank wall ) to the location of the food is the epoch/trajectory the fish had to memorize in order to perform path integration . This was measured in each of the \u2018food\u2019 trials ( Figure 7A , B ) ; the segment from the last encounter ( 3 cm from a landmark or 6 cm from the arena wall ) to the detection of food ( 3 cm from food location ) was found and the trajectory\u2019s total length and duration were computed . The spatial \u2018decoding\u2019 errors were obtained by measuring where the fish searched for the missing food in the probe trials ( Figure 7D , E ) ; the normalized histogram of the visiting frequency across space ( heat map ) was fitted with a two-dimensional Gaussian function:Px , y=A\u2219exp-121-\u03b82x-\u03bcx2\u03c3x2+y-\u03bcy2\u03c3y2-2\u03b8x-\u03bcxy-\u03bcy\u03c3x\u03c3ywhere \u03bcx and \u03bcy are mean parameters; \u03c3x and \u03c3y are variance parameters; A is a gain parameter and \u03b8 is the cross correlation parameter . The distance between the Gaussian center ( \u03bcx , \u03bcy ) ( white \u2018x\u2019 mark ) and the food location ( white \u2018+\u2019 mark ) is the spatial error; dividing this error by the median velocity in the trial produces the temporal error ."}
{"headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["neuroscience"], "id": "elife-07886-v2", "summary": "Electrocorticography , or ECoG , is a technique that is used to record the electrical activity of the brain via electrodes placed inside the skull . This electrical activity repeatedly rises and falls , and can therefore be represented as a series of waves . All waves have three basic properties: amplitude , frequency and phase . Amplitude describes the height of a wave's peaks ( and the depth of its troughs ) , and frequency defines how many waves are produced per second . The phase of a wave changes from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 between two consecutive peaks of that wave and then repeats , similar to the phases of the moon . Previous studies have shown that brain activity at different frequencies can interact . For instance , neural firing ( when nerve impulses are sent from one neuron to the next ) is related to \u2018high frequency activity\u2019; and the amplitude of high frequency activity can be altered by the phase of other , lower frequency brain activity . It has been suggested that this phenomenon , called \u2018phase-amplitude coupling\u2019 , might be one way that the brain uses to represent information . This \u2018phase coding\u2019 hypothesis has been demonstrated in rodents but is largely untested in humans . Now , Watrous et al . have explored this hypothesis in epilepsy patients who had ECoG electrodes implanted in their brains for a diagnostic procedure before surgery . These electrodes were used to record brain activity while the patients viewed images from four different categories ( houses , scenes , tools and faces ) . Watrous et al . found that phase-amplitude coupling occurred in over 40% of the recordings of brain activity . The analysis also revealed that the phase of the lower frequency activity at which the high frequency activity occurred was different for each of the four image categories . This provides support for the phase-coding hypothesis in humans . Furthermore , it suggests that not only how much neural firing occurs but also when ( or specifically at what phase ) it occurs is important for how the brain represents information . Future studies could now build on this analysis to see if phase-amplitude coupling also supports phase coding and neural representations in other thought processes , such as memory and navigation .", "source": "Prior studies have shown that high-frequency activity ( HFA ) is modulated by the phase of low-frequency activity . This phenomenon of phase-amplitude coupling ( PAC ) is often interpreted as reflecting phase coding of neural representations , although evidence for this link is still lacking in humans . Here , we show that PAC indeed supports phase-dependent stimulus representations for categories . Six patients with medication-resistant epilepsy viewed images of faces , tools , houses , and scenes during simultaneous acquisition of intracranial recordings . Analyzing 167 electrodes , we observed PAC at 43% of electrodes . Further inspection of PAC revealed that category specific HFA modulations occurred at different phases and frequencies of the underlying low-frequency rhythm , permitting decoding of categorical information using the phase at which HFA events occurred . These results provide evidence for categorical phase-coded neural representations and are the first to show that PAC coincides with phase-dependent coding in the human brain . \n Perceptual representations of the environment are critical to an animal's survival and are believed to occur through coactivated neuronal groups known as cell assemblies . Human neuronal firing ( Ekstrom et al . , 2007; Kraskov et al . , 2007; Chan et al . , 2011; Rey et al . , 2014 ) and increases in high-frequency activity ( HFA ) in the gamma range ( above 30 Hz; Jacobs and Kahana , 2009; Jacobs et al . , 2012; van Gerven et al . , 2013 ) carry information about perceptual and mnemonic representations . Several recent studies have shown that these two signals are positively correlated ( Ray et al . , 2008; Manning et al . , 2009; Whittingstall and Logothetis , 2009; Miller et al . , 2014; Rey et al . , 2014; Burke et al . , 2015 ) and are each modulated by the phase of low frequency oscillations ( LFO ) ( O'Keefe and Recce , 1993; Bragin et al . , 1995; Skaggs et al . , 1996; Canolty et al . , 2006; Jacobs et al . , 2007; Tort et al . , 2009; Axmacher et al . , 2010; Rutishauser et al . , 2010; McGinn and Valiante , 2014 ) . This modulation is detectable as phase-amplitude coupling ( PAC ) of gamma amplitude to LFO phase ( Buzsaki , 2010; Miller et al . , 2014; Aru et al . , 2015 ) . Together , these findings have motivated models positing that LFO phase may organize cell assemblies ( Kayser et al . , 2012; Lisman and Jensen , 2013; Jensen et al . , 2014; Watrous et al . , 2015 ) , a form of phase coding ( O'Keefe and Recce , 1993 ) . Supporting this view , LFO phase can be used to decode behaviorally relevant information ( Belitski et al . , 2008 , 2010; Fell et al . , 2008; Schyns et al . , 2011; Lopour et al . , 2013; Ng et al . , 2013 ) and phase coded neural activity has been demonstrated in rodents ( O'Keefe and Recce , 1993; Skaggs et al . , 1996 ) and monkeys ( Kayser et al . , 2009; Siegel et al . , 2009 ) . Although the PAC observed in humans ( Canolty et al . , 2006; Axmacher et al . , 2010 ) has been thought to reflect phase-coding , this assumption has yet to be validated because prior studies have not investigated the relation between PAC and decoding from LFO phases . We have recently proposed that the frequency-specific phase of LFO coordinates neural firing to support neural representations ( Watrous and Ekstrom , 2014; Watrous et al . , 2015 ) . Here , we tested this prediction , a form of the phase-coding hypothesis in humans , by examining the relation between PAC and neural representations for categories . We analyzed intracranial recordings from 167 electrodes in six patients with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy as they viewed pictures of houses , tools , scenes , and faces . First , we identified PAC on individual electrodes by using a recently developed metric which allows for the characterization of PAC across individual HFA events . On electrodes exhibiting PAC , we then assessed the distinctiveness of each category's phase-coded representation during periods with and without pronounced HFA . Our results suggest that during periods with pronounced HFA , categorical representations can be recovered based on the phase of low-frequency oscillations , supporting the idea of phase-coded neural representations in humans . \n Testing the phase-coding hypothesis , we asked if high frequency activity occurred during category-specific phases of the modulatory LFO . Figure 3A shows two traces from an example electrode which are color-coded by the instantaneous phase at Fmax . HFA windows ( boxes color coded by 1 Hz phase ) occurred during different modulatory phases depending on stimulus category . On this electrode , phases extracted during HFA windows were clustered for each category to different phases , resulting in category-specific phase-clustering ( Figure 3B ) . Similar findings were observed in other patients ( Figure 3C ) , and appeared distinct from representations using power or phase ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1 , 2 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07886 . 009Figure 3 . HFA occurs at category-specific low-frequency phases . ( A ) Two example trials from patient #6 demonstrating that HFA windows occur at different phases for different categories . The signal is color-coded by the phase of 1 Hz oscillation only during the stimulus period . Times prior to stimulus period are shown in order to visualize the 1 Hz modulatory signal . HFA windows are indicated by the boxes , color-coded by the 1 Hz phase at which they occur . ( B ) Summary circular histograms and resultant vectors for this electrode .

( Right ) HFA windows , color coded by 1 Hz phase , for each category .

Proportion of 167 electrodes showing significant phase-clustering ( Rayleigh test , p < 0 . 000001 ) exclusively for houses , tools , scenes , or faces as a function of time and frequency . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07886 . 012 These findings imply that representations might occur by the category-specific phase at which HFA events occur . In order to further quantify this effect , we developed a simple metric , the difference score ( \u2018DS\u2019 ) , which allowed us to identify the distinctiveness of each category's phase distribution during HFA windows . We applied this metric to the subset of 63 PAC+ electrodes showing significant phase-clustered HFA for each category . This was necessary in order to exclude spurious phase differences between categories occurring in the absence of phase clustering . Across all patients , 78% ( 49/63 ) of PAC+ electrodes showed a unique phase-clustering profile for one category compared with each other category ( e . g . , Figure 1B; DS = 3 for at least one category , p < 10\u22129 , Watson Williams test , Bonferroni corrected across comparisons ) . This pattern was consistent both within and across patients , with at least 15% of electrodes in each patient showing these effects ( Figure 3D ) . We next calculated the average phase difference between categories , expecting this measure to increase with increasing DS . Indeed , categories with larger DSs exhibited larger phase differences with other categories such that maximally distinct representations were 35\u00b0 phase offset from all other categories ( Figure 3E ) . As described above , PAC was most likely to occur at the oscillatory trough ( Figure 2I and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Nonetheless , on individual electrodes or for individual categories , HFA could occur at different phases . In fact , across electrodes , phase-coding was equally likely to occur at all phases and for all categories; phase-coded categories were not clustered at particular phases at any level of DS ( Rayleigh test , all p > 0 . 19; Figure 3F ) and phase-coding was equally likely for each category ( \u03c72 ( 3 ) = 1 . 6 , p = 0 . 64 ) . Thus , a large proportion of PAC+ electrodes also show category-specific phase clustering of HFA events to different phases ( Video 1 ) , suggesting that PAC is related to phase-coding ( Figure 1B , middle ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07886 . 013Video 1 . Significant electrodes rendered onto a glass brain . Each point represents an electrode , and each color represents different effects . Black electrodes ( n = 95 ) did not show significant phase-amplitude coupling ( PAC ) . Green electrodes ( n = 9 ) only showed significant PAC . Yellow electrodes ( n = 14 ) showed significant PAC and phase-clustering of HFA for all 4 categories . Red electrodes ( n = 49 ) showed significant PAC , phase-clustering for all 4 categories , and phase-coding of high-frequency activity ( i . e . , difference score of 3 for at least one category ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07886 . 013 To link these findings more directly to neural coding , we used pattern classification to determine if the phase at which HFA events occur is sufficient to recover categorical information ( see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 ) . As expected from the analysis using DS , 42 ( 25% of all ) electrodes showed significant decoding accuracy ( using LFO phases during HFA windows as features ) compared to category label shuffled surrogates and this proportion was significantly higher than would be expected by chance ( p < 10\u221210 , binomial test , chance level: 8 . 3 electrodes , Cohen's d = 0 . 6 ) . Next , we assessed whether phase-coding of categorical information indeed depended on HFA , as would be expected if PAC supports phase-coding . We compared decoding accuracy during HFA events to decoding accuracy during randomly selected surrogate events . 19 ( 11% ) electrodes showed significantly higher decoding accuracy during HFA events as compared to random event surrogates , and this proportion was significantly higher than would be expected by chance ( p < 0 . 0003 , binomial test , chance = 8 . 3 electrodes , Cohen's d = 0 . 22 ) . Moreover , 17 ( 10% ) electrodes showed significant enhancements of decoding accuracy during HFA events relative to both label and event shuffled surrogates , with at least two electrodes in each patient showing this pattern . This proportion of electrodes far exceeded that expected by chance ( p < 10\u221210 , binomial test , chance = 0 . 41 electrodes , Cohen's d = 0 . 46 ) . These findings complement the above results using DS and indicate that the phase at which HFA events occur carries sufficient information to decode image category , suggesting such information may be a relevant component of the neural code . We performed several control analyses to rule out alternative explanations . First , if slow oscillatory phase relates to category-specific representations , we expect phase-locking across trials to different categories . We observed significant phase locking on many electrodes to specific categories ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 , Rayleigh test , p < 0 . 000001 ) , similar to previous studies which have identified phase-locked activity ( e . g . , Fell et al . , 2008 ) . Second , we excluded the possibility that our PAC+ or phase-clustering inclusion criteria biased our findings by computing a composite measure of phase representation ( PR ) on each electrode ( see \u2018Supplement results\u2019 ) . This analysis again revealed that phase coding is largest on PAC+ electrodes and is enhanced during HFA windows . Third , for comparison with prior PAC methods , we recomputed PAC using the modulation index ( MI , Tort et al . , 2009 ) in different low-frequency bands , again finding PAC that was most prevalent in the delta band ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Lastly , several models predict that neural processes forming representations will show frequency-specificity ( Siegel et al . , 2012; Watrous and Ekstrom , 2014; Womelsdorf et al . , 2014 ) . We therefore recalculated phase-clustering and DS at the minimum modulatory frequency ( FMIN; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 for individual subject values ) using the same criteria detailed above . As one would expect , on PAC+ electrodes , phase clustering was larger at FMAX compared to at FMIN , both on individual electrodes ( Figure 4A , B ) and at the group level ( Figure 4C; paired t-test on resultant vector lengths , t ( 287 ) = 8 , p < 10\u221210 , Cohen's d = 0 . 32 ) . Moreover , only 20% ( 15/72 ) of PAC+ electrodes showed significant phase-clustering at FMIN for all 4 categories and only 1 electrode showed category-selective phase-clustering of HFA events . Given that the phase of slower frequencies varies less over time and that we primarily identified Fmax at slow frequencies , this result might be biased towards finding enhanced phase clustering at Fmax . We therefore recalculated phase clustering across the full range of frequencies ( 1\u201312 Hz , 0 . 1 Hz steps ) . Again , we found enhanced phase-clustering around 0 . 5 and 1 Hz ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , but not at adjacent frequencies as would be expected from this alternative account . Taken together , these results support the conclusion that HFA at distinct phases and frequencies reflect representations for different categories . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07886 . 014Figure 4 . HFA clusters to specific phases and frequencies for different categories .

( C ) At the group level , phase clustering was more prominent at the maximum frequency ( Fmax; maroon ) compared to the minimum frequency ( Fmin; black ) across categories and PAC+ electrodes .

Phase-locked activity as a function of frequency and electrode . Values are expressed as percentage of maximal phase clustering . We calculated the resultant vector length for each category , summed these values across categories , and divided by the maximum value of 4 . If our analysis was biased towards observing effects at slow frequencies , we would expect a smooth gradient of large phase clustering values at low frequencies , trailing off to smaller values at higher frequencies . Instead , there are clear peaks in phase clustering around 0 . 5 and 1 Hz and not at adjacent frequencies , particularly at frequencies lower than 0 . 5 Hz . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07886 . 016 \n We tested the hypothesis that PAC reflects a phase-coding mechanism , measuring both PAC and categorical PR in intracranial recordings from six patients who viewed pictures from different categories . Our analyses show that on a large subset of electrodes showing PAC , the frequency-specific phase at which HFA occurs varies with categorical information . Therefore , to the extent that HFA reflects increases in local neuronal activity ( Crone et al . , 1998; Miller et al . , 2014 ) , our results suggest that neural representations for categories might occur by the phase at which neurons fire . These findings thus provide a novel link between PAC and phase-coded neural representations in humans . Critically , although PAC and phase-coded representations share some attributes , such as phase-clustering of activity , they are not necessarily identical processes . High frequency activity could occur at particular phases of LFOs , as reflected by PAC , but these phases may not vary with stimulus category ( Figure 1B , left ) . In other words , there could be PAC without phase coding . This is in fact the null hypothesis we have tested and would manifest as PAC with DSs of zero . On the other hand , categorical information may be represented by specific low-frequency phases independent of HFA , leading to DS without phase-clustering across HFA events ( PAC; Figure 1B , right ) . We did not find a complete overlap between PAC+ and phase-coding electrodes , indicating that each can occur in isolation , but instead found a compromise between these extremes ( Figure 1B , middle ) . These results suggest that PAC in many cases reflects phase coding because of the significant overlap between the two phenomena ( Video 1 ) . Phase-coding , in the form of phase-modulated neuronal firing , has been identified in rodents , monkeys , and humans ( O'Keefe and Recce , 1993; Skaggs et al . , 1996; Jacobs et al . , 2007; Kayser et al . , 2009; Rutishauser et al . , 2010 ) . Although the mechanisms which guide such a neuronal phase preference remain poorly understood , previous studies have found enhanced PAC during learning and memory tasks ( Tort et al . , 2008; Axmacher et al . , 2010; Kendrick et al . , 2011; Friese et al . , 2013; Lega et al . , 2014 ) . Our findings provide a potentially unifying account of these observations , suggesting that PAC may be promoting the formation of phase-coded neural assemblies ( Canolty and Knight , 2010; Watrous and Ekstrom , 2014; Watrous et al . , 2015 ) . Follow-up studies will need to test this account of PAC as it relates to other putative roles for PAC ( Canolty and Knight , 2010; Voytek et al . , 2015 ) . While epilepsy is marked by increased synchronized neuronal activity which could potentially manifest as HFA or PAC , we believe several factors weigh against this interpretation . First , we only analyzed electrodes overlying putatively healthy tissue , typically from the hemisphere contralateral to the epileptic focus , as assessed by our clinical team . Electrodes showing epileptic spiking were systematically removed from our analysis and all analyzed trials were visually inspected for artifacts related to epilepsy . Next , the PAC metric allows for assessment of the modulatory signal . Visual inspection of these signals did not reveal a similarity to epileptic spikes ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Finally , it seems unlikely that epileptic activity at different phases would systematically differ by category . Similar reasoning excludes saccade-related artifacts ( Yuval-Greenberg et al . , 2008; Kovatch et al . , 2011 ) as a parsimonious account of our results . We therefore conclude that similar findings would translate into healthy human populations . Another caveat is that our results provide evidence for categorical phase-coding based on a restricted image set . This was necessary in the present study to maximize the chances of identifying category-selective responses while still ensuring that these responses were generalizable across a few exemplars . Follow-up studies should test the generalizability of these findings using more exemplars within a category and using other categories . PAC has typically been investigated using pre-defined low and high-frequency filters which may optimize statistical power for detecting PAC but do not adequately deal with the time-resolved nature of cognition ( Aru et al . , 2015 ) . Here , we leveraged a recent method which can identify PAC and subsequently test mechanistically interesting questions related to the modulation of HFA , such as its temporal profile and its dependence on phase , frequency , and behavioral requirements . Notably , this method may conservatively estimate PAC because it is based on transient increases in HFA , which do not necessarily occur in all cases of PAC . Our findings demonstrate that PAC and large HFA events can be identified and subsequently linked to categorically distinct representations . These results thus extend previous research which has decoded neural representations using either low or high frequency activity ( Jacobs and Kahana , 2009; Schyns et al . , 2011; van Gerven et al . , 2013 ) and may provide new avenues for decoding the human representational system . Intriguingly , phase-coding of categorical information extended beyond brain areas associated with higher-order vision . Thus , our findings of category-specificity do not appear to exclusively relate to perception but may also involve other more complex , and idiosyncratic , associations to these stimuli . Our findings are nonetheless in line with prior work ( Majima et al . , 2014; Yaffe et al . , 2014; Zhang et al . , 2015 ) which has found spatially-distributed content-specific representations . We identified frequency-specific PRs in humans , consistent with a growing body of evidence implicating the relevance of frequency-specific oscillatory activity to human cognition ( Daitch et al . , 2013; Watrous et al . , 2013; Fontolan et al . , 2014; Freudenburg et al . , 2014 ) . These findings are therefore consistent with models implicating frequency-specific oscillations as central to higher-order cognition ( Siegel et al . , 2012; Watrous and Ekstrom , 2014; Watrous et al . , 2015 ) . It has recently been shown that the frequency of LFOs contributes to several neuronal properties such that relatively slower LFOs lead to decreased firing threshold and increased spike timing variability ( Cohen , 2014 ) . It is not immediately clear how this relates to our finding that PAC predominantly occurs with modulating frequencies in the delta band , particularly around 1 Hz . It is possible that our findings reflect the activation of assemblies during \u2018up\u2019 states which show a similar frequency profile ( Destexhe et al . , 2007 ) or that the applied method of identifying peaks in the spectrum biased our findings to find PAC at lower frequencies . A third possibility , more likely in our view based on our results indicating multiple modulating frequencies per electrode ( Figure 2G ) , is that the timing of our task ( 1 image per second with a jittered inter-stimulus interval ) partially entrained slow oscillations forming an oscillatory hierarchy ( Lakatos et al . , 2005 ) . Similarly , our results showing PAC at a variety of phases and frequencies ( Maris et al . , 2011; van der Meij et al . , 2012 ) , particularly near 32 Hz , might reflect a form of \u2018nested coupling\u2019 ( Kopell et al . , 2010 ) distinct from \u2018broadband\u2019 high gamma , which has been suggested to reflect population spiking ( Manning et al . , 2009; Miller et al . , 2014 ) . Future research may clarify this issue by comparing single neuron activity and HFA modulation during different perceptual tasks and by investigating their relation to hierarchical cross-frequency coupling . To summarize , by identifying electrodes exhibiting both PAC and phase-coded neural representations for categories , our results employing direct brain recordings explicitly link phase-coupled neural activity to phase coding in humans . \n Six right handed patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy ( mean age 31 . 8 years; 3 female ) participated in the study . All patients were stereotactically implanted for diagnostic purposes . Medial temporal depth electrodes ( AD-Tech , Racine , WI , USA ) with 10 cylindrical platinum-iridium contacts ( diameter: 1 . 3 mm ) were implanted in 1 patient , and 5 patients were implanted with subdural grid and strip electrodes with stainless-steel contacts ( diameter: 4 mm ) at temporal , frontal , and parietal sites ( Video 2 ) . Recordings were performed using a Stellate recording system ( Stellate GmbH , Munich , Germany ) at the Department of Epileptology , University of Bonn , Germany . The study was conducted according to the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethical committee of the medical faculty at the University of Bonn ( approval identifier 280/08 ) . All patients provided written informed consent to participate in the study and for the results to be published in a pseudonymized manner . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07886 . 017Video 2 . Electrode locations for each patient , rendered onto a glass brain of the average MNI template . Each point represents an electrode , and each color represents a different patient . Electrodes were primarily located in the temporal lobe . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07886 . 017 Patients performed an object\u2013location association task , though here we focus on neural representations for categories independent of memory encoding per se . Patients viewed greyscale images taken from four different categories ( houses , tools , scenes , and faces ) and each category had four unique stimuli , resulting in a stimulus set of 16 unique images . Example images from each category are shown in Figure 1A . Each image was presented 30 times in pseudo random order ( total of 480 trials ) and was followed by a white square in a fixed location . Patients were instructed to form object\u2013location associations and to rate if they liked or disliked each image , thus ensuring that they were attending to each image presentation . Images were presented on a laptop placed in front of the patient . Each image was presented for 1 s , followed by the white square presented for 1 s , and finally a jittered inter-stimulus interval ranging from 1800\u20132200 ms . A fixation cross was presented between images . Intracranial EEG recordings ( sampled at 1000 Hz ) were referenced to linked mastoids and band-pass filtered ( 0 . 01 Hz [6 dB/octave] to 300 Hz [12 dB/octave] ) . Recordings from the hemisphere contralateral to the epileptogenic focus were analyzed . To boost our electrode sampling , an additional 32 electrodes from an ipsilateral left lateral temporal grid were included from patient 5 based on the physicians' report , which indicated a left hippocampal focus and no evidence of neocortical lesion based on an magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Signals from this grid were carefully visually inspected for artifacts and did not show increased artifacts associated with epilepsy . Qualitatively similar results were observed when excluding these electrodes from the analysis , with the proportions of electrodes showing any reported effect changing by no more than 3% . Electrode locations were determined by post-implantation MRI such that electrodes were mapped by co-registering pre- and post-implantation MRIs , normalizing the pre-implantation MRI and applying the normalization matrix to the post-implantation MRI . The anatomical locations of contacts were then identified by comparison with standardized anatomical atlases and using custom software ( published at http://pylocator . thorstenkranz . de/ ) . In total , 167 implanted electrode contacts were analyzed across all patients ( Video 2 ) . Raw EEG signals were extracted from 750 ms before to 1500 ms after image onset . EEG trials were visually inspected for artifacts ( e . g . , epileptiform spikes ) , and trials with artifacts were excluded from further analysis ( 15% of all trials on average ) . Trial epochs were then concatenated for subsequent analysis described below . We analyzed an average of 103 trials per category and subject and there were no differences in total number of trials analyzed across categories ( F ( 3 , 20 ) = 0 . 38 , p = 0 . 76 ) . PAC was detected using the methods described by Dvorak and Fenton ( 2014 ) . This method is conceptually similar to an event-locked analysis around periods of enhanced HFA . All analyses were conducted using standard routines in EEGLab ( Delorme and Makeig , 2004 ) and Matlab based on previously published algorithms ( Rizzuto et al . , 2006; Berens , 2009; Tort et al . , 2009; Dvorak and Fenton , 2014 ) . In brief , the power and phase of the signal on each electrode was computed in the low frequency ( Fphase , 0 . 5\u201312 Hz , 0 . 5 Hz steps ) and gamma ( Famp , center frequencies at 32\u2013120 Hz , 4 Hz steps ) bands using Morlet wavelet convolution with 7 cycles . At each center HFA frequency , the time course of power values was z-scored and time periods exceeding the 95th percentile of these values were identified ( we refer to these as \u2018HFA windows\u2019 , red shaded area in Figure 2C ) . The time point of the largest power value within each window was identified and taken as the time-locking \u2018HFA event\u2019 for OTC analyses ( arrow , Figure 2C ) . Two-second segments ( 1 s before to 1 s after each HFA event ) of the raw signal were extracted around these timestamps and raw signal segments were summed at each time point across segments , resulting in the modulatory signal at each center HFA frequency . The strength of modulation was determined based on the peak to trough height of the modulatory signal . Surrogate modulatory signals ( n = 100 ) were constructed at each modulated frequency based on choosing an equal number of pseudo-HFA events at random timestamps and repeating the above procedure . Surrogate modulation strengths were extracted and used to z-score the observed modulation strength . PAC+ electrodes were identified as electrodes ( 1 ) with a modulation strength z-score >4 . 35 for at least one gamma frequency and ( 2 ) with a clear peak in the power spectrum of the raw signal at Fphase ( Aru et al . , 2015 ) . This z-score threshold was calculated by identifying the z value equivalent to a Bonferroni corrected ( across 23 gamma frequencies and 167 electrodes ) alpha threshold of p < 0 . 05 and corresponded to p < 0 . 00005 . Peaks were identified by normalizing the power spectrum of both the raw and modulatory signal to their respective maxima and ensuring that both normalized signals were maximal ( i . e . , 1 ) at the same frequency . We identified the peak HFA modulation frequency as the frequency with the largest z-score and extracted the modulatory signal ( see Figure 2B ) . The phase and frequency content of the modulatory signal was determined using a Hilbert transform and fast Fourier transform , respectively . The modulatory signal was mean-centered prior to FFT in order to remove DC components . The maximum ( \u2018FMAX\u2019 ) and minimum ( \u2018FMIN\u2019 ) of this FFT output indicate the strongest and weakest slow-modulating frequencies in the 0 . 5\u201312 Hz band , respectively . Phase comparisons were conducted using a Watson Williams test following Rizzuto et al ( 2006 ) and using code taken from these eegtoolbox available at ( http://memory . psych . upenn . edu/Software ) . Statistical testing was performed between the phases extracted during HFA windows for all pairs of conditions ( 4 categories; 6 total category pairs ) . DSs were computed for each category as the total number of significant differences ( p < 0 . 001 ) between the phase distribution for one category and the remaining categories and thus ranged from 0 ( no difference to any other category ) to 3 ( significant difference to all other categories ) . Phase clustering scores were defined as the resultant vector length for each category's phase distribution . We used a pattern classification approach for comparison with our DS metric , classifying image category based on the phase at which HFA events occur . To this end , we trained support vector machines using a linear kernel and fivefold cross-validation . Phase values at Fmax were extracted at moments in time when HFA events occurred during image presentation and were used as input features for the classifier . Similar to previous approaches ( Lopour et al . , 2013; Majima et al . , 2014 ) , the sine and cosine of the phase values were used as input features for phase . Classifiers were run separately on each electrode and the classifier output was a prediction of the category label for each HFA event . Classification accuracy was defined as the average proportion of correctly classified HFA events across folds . Chance classification performance varies across electrodes because we classified the category label associated with each HFA event and the number of HFA events per category varied across electrodes . We thus opted to report significance based on permutation testing which accounts for the varying chance level across electrodes and assessed the significance of classification using two separate analyses which both utilized permutation testing . First , we randomized the category labels associated with HFA events and assessed classification accuracy . Second , we used random time points ( also corresponding to random phases ) as surrogate HFA events and assessed classification accuracy . Each type of permutation test was performed 50 times , resulting in a distribution of pseudo classification accuracy values for each test . Observed classification accuracies at or above the 95th percentile of each of these distributions were deemed significant . Thus , we fixed the type 1 error rate for each test at 5% and , assuming independence between tests , we would therefore expect 0 . 0025 \u00d7 167 = 0 . 42 electrodes to show significance by chance for both permutation tests ."}

It is estimated that 3 . 4 billion people worldwide live in regions where they are at risk of malaria , and malaria infections cause hundreds of thousands of deaths each year . When a mosquito carrying Plasmodium parasites in its salivary glands bites a human , the parasite is injected into the person's bloodstream with the mosquito's saliva . The parasite then travels through the bloodstream to the liver , where it infects liver cells and multiplies without causing any symptoms for up to 4 weeks . After this period , the parasites break out of each infected liver cell , re-enter the bloodstream , and begin infecting red blood cells . When another mosquito bites the infected individual to feed on their blood , the parasite moves into the mosquito with the red blood cells and the cycle of infection continues . While prevention and control measures have dramatically reduced the incidence of malaria in some countries , many people in African countries\u2014and especially young children\u2014die from malaria each year . Finding ways to reduce the spread of Plasmodium parasites , and in particular Plasmodium falciparum ( which is responsible for the deadliest type of malaria ) , is critical for the global effort to control and eliminate this disease . As such , many researchers are trying to gain a better understanding of how the parasite both invades host cells and evades the immune system . In this study , Chen et al . reveal the high-resolution structure of PfRh5 , the protein from Plasmodium falciparum that forms a complex with other proteins to allow the parasite to bind to , and invade , red blood cells . This is one of the first three-dimensional structures that have been uncovered for this family of proteins\u2014and reveals that the PfRh5 protein is shaped like an elliptical disk . Solving the structure of PfRh5 is the first step in understanding the role of this protein , and the other protein components , involved in invading red blood cells . These proteins are molecules that could potentially be used to vaccinate people against malaria , and understanding these proteins' functions will help efforts to design vaccines to prevent malarial disease .", "source": "Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria in humans and is responsible for over 700 , 000 deaths annually . It is an obligate intracellular parasite and invades erythrocytes where it grows in a relatively protected niche . Invasion of erythrocytes is essential for parasite survival and this involves interplay of multiple protein\u2013protein interactions . One of the most important interactions is binding of parasite invasion ligand families EBLs and PfRhs to host receptors on the surface of erythrocytes . PfRh5 is the only essential invasion ligand within the PfRh family and is an important vaccine candidate . PfRh5 binds the host receptor basigin . In this study , we have determined the crystal structure of PfRh5 using diffraction data to 2 . 18 \u00c5 resolution . PfRh5 exhibits a novel fold , comprising nine mostly anti-parallel \u03b1-helices encasing an N-terminal \u03b2-hairpin , with the overall shape being an elliptical disk . This is the first three-dimensional structure determined for the PfRh family of proteins . \n Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe form of malaria with over 700 , 000 deaths each year , mostly in sub-Saharan Africa . The asexual blood cycle of this parasite begins with the invasion of human erythrocytes by the merozoite form of P . falciparum in a complex multistep process involving a cascade of protein\u2013protein interactions between the parasite and host cell ( reviewed in Cowman and Crabb , 2006 ) . This process requires members of the reticulocyte binding-like homologues ( PfRh or PfRBP ) and erythrocyte binding-like ( EBL ) ligand families . PfRh5 is a member of the PfRh family and binds specifically to the receptor basigin on the human erythrocyte surface ( Crosnier et al . , 2011 ) . This protein plays an essential role in merozoite invasion ( Baum et al . , 2009 ) and host tropism of P . falciparum ( Wanaguru et al . , 2013 ) . Polymorphisms in PfRh5 can convert a non-virulent Plasmodium falciparum parasite into a virulent form upon infection of Aotus monkeys , supporting the view that this ligand is a determinant of virulence and host specificity ( Hayton et al . , 2008 ) . PfRh5 has distinct characteristics suggesting that it plays a different role to other members of the family . In particular , PfRh5 is a much smaller protein ( \u223c60 kDa compared to the average of \u223c300 kDa for the family ) and lacks a transmembrane region . It forms a complex with the cysteine-rich protein PfRipr during merozoite invasion; the complex is peripherally associated with parasite membranes and is released at the apical end of the merozoite during invasion of the human erythrocyte ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) . Antibodies to PfRh5 can block merozoite invasion , suggesting that it is a potential vaccine candidate ( Douglas et al . , 2011; Williams et al . , 2012; Patel et al . , 2013; Reddy et al . , 2014 ) . This is supported by clinical data showing that antibodies to PfRh5 are associated with protection against malaria , indicating that PfRh5 may be a component of acquired protective immunity ( Chiu et al . , 2014; Tran et al . , 2014 ) . To provide a molecular basis for understanding the function of PfRh5 , we have determined the crystal structure of PfRh5 using diffraction data to 2 . 18 \u00c5 resolution , the first three-dimensional structure in PfRh protein family . We show that it exhibits a novel fold . \n Initially , the full-length 60-kDa protein was expressed in insect cells . Although the recombinant protein was capable of binding red blood cells , it was unstable , with the N-terminal region proteolytically degraded to yield a 48-kDa fragment that had a higher erythrocyte binding affinity than that of the full-length protein ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We determined the N-terminal amino acid sequence by mass spectrometry and re-expressed this region in insect cells to produce a highly stable module of PfRh5 that we denote PfRh5-C ( Figure 1A ) . PfRh5-C likely reflects the 45-kDa processed form present in P . falciparum and released into culture supernatant during merozoite invasion ( Baum et al . , 2009 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04187 . 003Figure 1 .

PfRh5-C and basigin were cross-linked with EDC in the presence of NHS . The mixture was then analysed on a SDS-PAGE gel and the band of the crosslinked complex was excised for trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion followed by mass spectrometric analysis . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04187 . 005 To show that PfRh5-C is functional , we demonstrated that it could bind red blood cells and the receptor human basigin , which is also produced in insect cells ( Figure 1A ) . PfRh5-C formed a stable complex with basigin as evidenced by size-exclusion chromatographic analysis . In these experiments , PfRh5-C was incubated with excess basigin and the stable PfRh5-basign complex eluted ahead of free PfRh5 and basigin ( Figure 1B ) . The stoichiometry of the complex was shown to be 1:1 by chemical cross-linking ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The binding affinity of the PfRh5-C\u2013basigin interaction was determined by surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) to be KD = 43 . 4 nM ( Figure 1C ) . This KD value is higher than that previously reported ( Crosnier et al . , 2011 ) . We note that while the PfRh5 sample used for the SPR measurement was prepared in monomeric form by gel-filtration chromatography , it is possible that a dynamic equilibrium with oligomeric forms within the sample has contributed to the higher affinity measurement . Antibodies to the recombinant PfRh5-C block growth of 3D7 and W2mef strains of P . falciparum at levels comparable to previous studies ( Douglas et al . , 2011; Bustamante et al . , 2013; Douglas et al . , 2014; Reddy et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 1D ) . Taken together , these data imply that PfRh5-C is functionally competent . PfRh5-C was crystallized and its structure determined through single-wavelength anomalous diffraction ( SAD ) phasing using iodine-derivatized crystals with subsequent refinement against native diffraction data to a resolution of 2 . 18 \u00c5 ( Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . The shape of PfRh5-C approximates an elliptical disk ( Figure 2 ) , the core consisting of nine mostly anti-parallel \u03b1-helices that encase a small \u03b2-hairpin located near the N-terminus ( Figure 2 and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We denote these nine helices \u03b11 , \u03b12a , \u03b12b , \u03b13a , \u03b13b , \u03b14 , \u03b15 , \u03b16 , and \u03b17 , where the numeric order indicates progression from N- to C-terminus along the polypeptide and the a and b suffixes indicate that \u03b12a and \u03b12b as well as helices \u03b13a and \u03b13b arise from breaks in the canonical ( i , i+4 ) hydrogen bonding pattern of longer \u2018parent helices\u2019 \u03b12 and \u03b13 , respectively . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04187 . 006Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04187 . 011 Helices \u03b14 , \u03b15 , \u03b16 , and \u03b17 assemble as a triplet-helical coiled-coil domain running the length of the long axis of the molecule . On the opposite side to the \u03b14/\u03b15/\u03b16/\u03b17 coiled-coil domain , helices \u03b11 , \u03b12a , and \u03b13b assemble to form a short three-helix bundle and helices \u03b12b and \u03b13a assemble to form a short two-helix coiled-coil domain , these domains being approximately half the length of the \u03b14/\u03b15/\u03b16/\u03b17 coiled-coil domain . The \u2018absence\u2019 of a third helix to the \u03b12b/\u03b13a coiled-coil is necessary to accommodate the small \u03b2-hairpin formed by residues 161\u2013175 in the overall tertiary structure . Within each of the three-helical domains , the central pairwise interactions between the constituent helices are overwhelmingly hydrophobic in nature . In contrast , the interactions between the helical domains and the \u03b2-hairpin and between the \u03b14/\u03b15/\u03b16/\u03b17 coiled-coil domain and the \u03b11/\u03b12a/\u03b13b bundle domain are of mixed hydrophilicity . Inspection shows these interfaces to be relatively loosely packed . There are two disulfide bonds within the structure . The first disulphide bond is Cys345\u2013Cys351 , located at one apex of the helical bundle . Cys345 lies at the C-terminal end of helix \u03b13b and Cys351 at the N-terminal end of helix \u03b14 . The second disulphide bond is Cys224\u2013Cys317; Cys224 lies close to the N-terminus of helix \u03b12b and Cys317 close to the C-terminus of helix \u03b13a , that is , in proximity to \u2018kink points\u2019 of the parent helices \u03b12 and \u03b13 . A large loop ( residues 240-297 ) , located at the opposite apex of molecule to the Cys345\u2013Cys351 disulphide bond , interconnects helices \u03b12b and \u03b13a ( Figure 2A ) . Electron density for residues 258\u2013293 is absent ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , indicating partial disorder of this loop within the crystal structure . Two free cysteine residues ( Cys203 in \u03b13 and Cys329 in \u03b14 ) occur within the structure; the side chain of the Cys329 residue is completely buried , whereas that of the Cys203 is only partly exposed ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Burial of these sulfhydryls is consistent with the monomeric nature of the native protein isolated from parasites and of the recombinant protein described here . A search using DALI ( Holm and Rosenstrom , 2010 ) indicates that the PfRh5 fold is novel . The only element of PfRh5-C found to have a structural homologue within the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) is the coiled-coil domain formed by helices \u03b15 , \u03b16 , and \u03b17 ( Figure 2 ) : this element can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation of all backbone atoms of 3 . 4 \u00c5 on the N-terminal coiled-coil domain ( residues 82\u2013226 ) of the SipB protein of the bacterial type III secretion system ( TTSS ) of Salmonella enterica ( PDB entry 3TUL , chain A ) ( Barta et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Analyses of molecular surface using DoGSiteScorer ( Volkamer et al . , 2012 ) detected a number of pockets of dimensions suitable for targeting with small molecules on the surface of the PfRh5 structure . These pockets arise from the relatively loose packing of the four constituent domains of the PfRh5 . One of these ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A ) is lined by residues of mixed hydrophilicity and has a surface area of \u223c430 \u00c52 , of which \u223c60% is lipophilic ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B ) . If this pocket is in proximity to the basigin binding site , small molecules targeting it may have the potential to interfere the interaction between the two molecules , either through disrupting the relatively loose packing of the constituent domains of PfRh5 or through steric interference . Alternatively , as PfRh5 functions in complex with PfRipr and at least one further parasite protein ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) , if this pocket is involved in binding these partner/s , a small molecule targeting this pocket may likewise interfere with the complex formation and therefore ultimately with its function . To explore the structure\u2013function relationship of PfRh5 , we examined the relevance of the disulphide bonds and cysteine residues for the function of PfRh5 by reducing and alkylating PfRh5-C followed by measuring the binding affinity of the modified protein to basigin using surface plasmon resonance ( Figure 3A ) . The reduced and alkylated PfRh5-C has an affinity for basigin with KD = 127 nM . A threefold reduction in affinity as compared to untreated PfRh5-C ( KD = 43 . 4 nM ) was consistent with the two disulphide-bonds being important for the stability of the overall fold of the protein rather than being directly involved in basigin binding . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04187 . 012Figure 3 . Binding of mutant PfRh5 to basigin . ( A ) The binding affinity of the reduced and alkylated PfRh5 to basigin measured by SPR . ( B ) The binding affinity of the PfRh5 mutant , in which the disordered loop has been deleted , to basigin measured by SPR . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04187 . 012 We also investigated whether the disordered region of 35 amino acids ( Glu258\u2013Asn293 ) ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) is involved in the binding of PfRh5 to human basigin . A mutant form of PfRh5-C lacking amino acids Asp261\u2013Asn289 ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) was produced in insect cells; its binding affinity for basigin was determined by SPR to be 25 . 9 nM ( Figure 3B ) , that is , comparable to that of the non-mutated PfRh5 . These data suggest that the disordered region ( Glu258\u2013Asn293 ) is not involved in receptor binding . \n Invasion of P . falciparum merozoite into human erythrocytes involves several ligand\u2013receptor interactions including the PfRh family of proteins , which are important in binding to and identifying the appropriate host cell for invasion ( reviewed in Cowman and Crabb , 2006 ) . Whilst PfRh5 is a member of the PfRh family , it appears to have distinct functions to other family members and it plays an essential role for invasion ( Baum et al . , 2009; Crosnier et al . , 2011 ) . To provide a structural basis for understanding the function of this protein , we determined its three-dimensional structure , the first crystal structure in the PfRh protein family . PfRh5 exhibits a novel fold comprising three-helical domains surrounding a small \u03b2-hairpin . PfRh5 appears to function as a multi-protein complex . We have previously identified one partner , PfRipr , for the complex ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) . The PfRh5\u2013PfRipr complex is essential for merozoite invasion as the genes encoding both proteins cannot be disrupted and antibodies to both inhibit this process ( Baum et al . , 2009; Chen et al . , 2011 ) . Consequently , both proteins are potential vaccine candidates and worth consideration for a combination vaccine because specific antibodies to both molecules would inhibit the same functional process and likely to be at least additive and potentially synergistic . The structural similarity of the larger PfRh5 coiled-coil domain with the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of SipB may potentially provide an indication of the function of the complex . SipB forms part of the Salmonella type III secretion system ( TTSS ) that is responsible for transport of bacterial effector proteins across the host cell membrane . Currently , there is no direct evidence that the PfRh5\u2013PfRipr complex is involved in transport of proteins or molecules across the erythrocyte membrane during invasion . Nevertheless , it is interesting that P . falciparum does inject proteins , including members of the RON complex , into the erythrocyte during merozoite invasion and these proteins are required for formation of the tight junction that bring the parasite membrane and host membrane together in a tight interaction through binding of RON2 to apical membrane antigen-1 ( AMA-1 ) ( Narum et al . , 2008; Richard et al . , 2010; Riglar et al . , 2011 ) . By analogy to the bacterial type III secretion system , the PfRh5\u2013PfRipr complex may play a role in transfer of components such as the RON complex to the host cell during merozoite invasion . In summary , this work has elucidated the structure of PfRh5 and may provide a model for the remainder of the PfRh family members . During the review process of this manuscript , a study was published reporting the structure of the Rh5\u2013basigin complex ( Wright et al . , 2014 ) . In contrast , our work describes the structure of Rh5 not bound to the receptor basigin . Comparison of the Rh5 structure in the bound and unbound state shows that there are no changes in the core structure on binding of receptor . A pocket identified on the surface of PfRh5 may provide an opportunity for development of a new anti-malaria drug . Structural similarity with SipB has provided the tantalizing possibility that PfRh5\u2013PfRipr complex may play a similar role to the TTSS system of bacteria that secrete effector proteins into the host cell . However , further evidence will be required to support such speculation . \n A synthetic gene encoding Plasmodium falciparum ( 3D7 ) full-length mature PfRh5 ( residues 24\u2013526 ) , PfRh5-C ( residues 127\u2013526 ) , or its mutant was inserted into insect/mammalian cell expression vector pgpHFT ( Xu et al . , 2010 ) using Kpn I and Xho I sites to produce pgpHFT-PfRh5 . The pgpHFT-PfRh5 was then co-transfected with FlashBAC ( Oxford Expression Technologies ) into Sf21 insect cells as per supplier's manual . The seed virus was amplified to obtain high-titer viral stocks , which were then used to infect Hi5 cells grown in express Five SFM medium ( Life Technologies Pty Ltd , Australia ) supplemented with 1 mM glutamine . The supernatant containing the secreted recombinant protein was harvested , centrifuged , and passed over anti-FLAG M2 agarose ( Sigma-Aldrich , Australia ) column . After extensive washing , bound proteins were eluted from the column with the FLAG peptide at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml , concentrated and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 column ( GL 10/300 , GE Healthcare , Australia ) in 50 mM Tris , 100 mM NaCl , pH 8 . 5 . For crystallization of PfRh5 , the tandem 6xHis and FLAG tags were removed by digestion with a TEV protease and the pure protein was recovered by Ni-resin and/or size-exclusion chromatography purification . Human basigin isoform 2 ( BSG-S ) ( Crosnier et al . , 2011 ) was also expressed in insect cells and purified as described for PfRh5 . Crystallization trials were performed in sitting drop within a 96-well format at 8\u00b0C . Crystals were obtained from drops containing 8\u201312% PEG3350 or PEG4000 and 0 . 2 M DL-malate-imidazole , pH 6 . 5-7 . 5 . X-ray diffraction data were collected on beamline MX2 at the Australian Synchrotron . For the phase determination , derivative crystals were prepared by quick-soaking native crystals in potassium iodide ( KI ) solutions prepared in cryoprotection solution for 1\u20135 min and data collected at the K-edge of 1 . 55 \u00c5 . Diffraction data were processed and scaled with XDS ( Kabsch , 2010 ) . Diffraction data were included to a maximum resolution of 2 . 18 \u00c5 based on significance of the CC1/2 criterion at the p = 0 . 001 level of significance ( Karplus and Diederichs , 2012 ) . Three iodine binding sites were found using SOLVE ( Terwilliger and Berendzen , 1999 ) ; phases were then improved using RESOLVE ( Terwilliger , 2000 ) . The initial model generated by the RESOLVE autobuild utility comprised only a partial set of the nine helices . Model building and refinement then continued with PHENIX ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) , with automated building and morphing routines leading to a model comprising approximately 50% of the PfRh5 sequence . Further rounds of refinement and manual rebuilding were undertaken using REFMAC5 ( Vagin et al . , 2004 ) and COOT ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) . The final refinement was undertaken with AutoBUSTER ( v2 . 10 . 0 ) ( Bricogne et al . , 2011 ) . Data processing and refinement statistics are in Figure 2\u2014source data 1 . Rabbits were immunised three times with 200 \u03bcg PfRh5 in Freund's adjuvant . IgG was purified from serum , concentrated and dialysed against RPMI-Hepes for growth inhibition assays . One cycle growth inhibition assay was performed as described ( Healer et al . , 2013 ) . Serial dilutions of IgG in RPMI-HEPES , starting at 10 mg/ml were added to P . falciparum-infected RBC ( 3D7 and W2mef ) at a parasitaemia of 0 . 5% . Parasitaemia was counted after 48 hr and specific growth inhibition calculated relative to parasites grown in non-immune IgG . Erythrocyte binding assays were performed as described previously ( Triglia et al . , 2001 ) . To prepare and analyse the PfRh5/basigin complex , two anti-flag affinity beads purified proteins were mixed , incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight and loaded to a Superdex 200 size-exclusion chromatography column in 50 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl , pH 8 . 5 or 25 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 2 . The complex eluted from the column was collected for analysis . Affinity ( KD ) measurements were performed at room temperature on a Biacore 3000 Biosensor with HBS ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 2 , 150 mM NaCl , 3 . 4 mM EDTA , 0 . 005% Tween 20 ) as the running buffer ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) . The human basigin was immobilized onto a CM5 sensorchip using amine-coupling ( EDC/NHS ) chemistry . PfRh5 or its mutants ( purified by anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads followed by gel-filtration chromatography ) were injected at 20 \u00b5l/min into the sensorchip containing a channel immobilized with basigin . A blank channel was used as control . After each injection , the chip was regenerated with 2 M NaCl supplemented with 3 mM NaOH in the running buffer , followed by two washes with the running buffer . Affinity ( KD ) was derived from sensorgrams , following subtraction of baseline responses , using BIA evaluation software ( version 4 . 1: Biacore Life Sciences , GE Healthcare , Australia ) . To an aliquot of 50 \u00b5l at 1 mg/ml PfRh5 was added DTT to a final concentration of 2 mM and incubated at room temperature for 2 hr . Iodoacetamide was then added to a final concentration of 10 mM , incubated at room temperature for 2 hr and then left at 4\u00b0C overnight . For SPR experiment , the excess DTT and iodoacetamide were removed by a desalting column equilibrated and eluted with HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 4 containing 150 mM NaCl . For cross-linking of PfRh5 to Basigin , to approximately 50 \u00b5g of purified PfRh5/Basigin complex in 25 mM MES , 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4 was added 1-ethyl-3- ( dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide ( EDC ) and N-hydroxysuccinimide ( NHS ) to a final concentration of 2 mM . The reaction was allowed to occur at room temperature for 30 min before quenching with 100 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 . The cross-linked sample was then analysed on a SDS-PAGE gel ."}

Adult mosquitoes fly to streams , ponds and other freshwater environments to lay their eggs . When the eggs hatch , the young mosquitoes live in the water until they are ready to grow wings and transform into adults . In the water , the young mosquitoes are particularly vulnerable to being eaten by dragonfly larvae , fish and other predators . When adult females are choosing where to lay their eggs , they can use their sense of smell to detect these predators and attempt to avoid them . Along with eating the mosquitoes , the predators may also reduce mosquito populations in other ways . For example , predators can disrupt feeding among young mosquitoes , which may affect the time that it takes for them to grow into adults or the size of their bodies once they reach the adult stage . Although the impacts of different predators have been tested separately in multiple settings , the overall effects of predators on the ability of mosquitoes to spread diseases to humans remain unclear . To address this question , Russell , Herzog et al . used an approach called meta-analysis on data from previous studies . The analysis found that along with increasing the death rates of mosquitoes , the presence of predators also leads to a reduction in the body size of those mosquitoes that survive , causing them to have shorter lifespans and fewer offspring . Russell , Herzog et al . found that one type of mosquito known as Culex \u2013 which carries West Nile virus \u2013 avoided laying its eggs near predators . During droughts , increased predation in streams , ponds and other aquatic environments may lead adult female Culex mosquitoes to lay their eggs closer to residential areas with fewer predators . Russell , Herzog et al . propose that this may be one reason why outbreaks of West Nile virus in humans are more likely to occur during droughts . In the future , these findings may help researchers to predict outbreaks of West Nile virus , malaria and other diseases carried by mosquitoes more accurately . Furthermore , the work of Russell , Herzog et al . provides examples of mosquito predators that could be used as biocontrol agents to decrease numbers of mosquitoes in certain regions .", "source": "Predator-prey interactions influence prey traits through both consumptive and non-consumptive effects , and variation in these traits can shape vector-borne disease dynamics . Meta-analysis methods were employed to generate predation effect sizes by different categories of predators and mosquito prey . This analysis showed that multiple families of aquatic predators are effective in consumptively reducing mosquito survival , and that the survival of Aedes , Anopheles , and Culex mosquitoes is negatively impacted by consumptive effects of predators . Mosquito larval size was found to play a more important role in explaining the heterogeneity of consumptive effects from predators than mosquito genus . Mosquito survival and body size were reduced by non-consumptive effects of predators , but development time was not significantly impacted . In addition , Culex vectors demonstrated predator avoidance behavior during oviposition . The results of this meta-analysis suggest that predators limit disease transmission by reducing both vector survival and vector size , and that associations between drought and human West Nile virus cases could be driven by the vector behavior of predator avoidance during oviposition . These findings are likely to be useful to infectious disease modelers who rely on vector traits as predictors of transmission . \n While it is well known that predation reduces vector populations through consumptive effects , non-consumptive effects of predators can also greatly impact prey demographics ( Preisser et al . , 2005 ) . Mosquitoes are vectors of a variety of debilitating and deadly diseases , including malaria , lymphatic filariasis , and arboviruses , such as chikungunya , Zika , and dengue ( Weaver and Reisen , 2010; WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION , 2020 ) . Consequently , there is motivation from a public health perspective to better understand the different drivers of variation in mosquito traits that can ultimately impact vector population growth and disease transmission . In addition , recent work has suggested that incorporation of vector trait variation into disease models can improve the reliability of their predictions ( Cator et al . , 2020 ) . In this study , systematic review and meta-analysis methods are used to synthesize a clearer understanding of the consumptive and non-consumptive effects of predators on mosquito traits , including survival , oviposition , development , and size . Mosquito insecticide resistance is recognized as a growing problem ( Hancock et al . , 2018; Hemingway and Ranson , 2000; Liu , 2015 ) leading some to suggest that control efforts should rely more heavily on \u2018non-insecticide based strategies\u2019 ( Benelli et al . , 2016 ) . The consumptive effects of predators on mosquitoes have previously been harnessed for biocontrol purposes . Past biocontrol efforts have used predators such as cyclopoid copepods ( Kay et al . , 2002; Marten , 1990; Russell et al . , 1996; Veronesi et al . , 2015 ) and mosquitofish ( Pyke , 2008 , Seale , 1917 ) to target the mosquito\u2019s aquatic larval stage . The strength of the consumptive effects of these predators on mosquitoes can be influenced by multiple factors , including predator-prey size ratio and temperature . Predator-prey body size ratios tend to be higher in freshwater habitats than other types of habitats ( Brose et al . , 2006 ) , and attack rate tends to increase with temperature ( Kalinoski and DeLong , 2016; Dam and Peterson , 1988 ) , although other studies suggest a unimodal response to temperature ( Uiterwaal and Delong , 2020; Englund et al . , 2011 ) . Predators can also have non-consumptive effects on prey ( Peacor and Werner , 2001 ) , and these effects are thought to be more pronounced in aquatic ecosystems than in terrestrial ecosystems ( Preisser et al . , 2005 ) . Non-consumptive effects of predators are the result of the prey initiating anti-predator behavioral and/or physiological trait changes that can aid in predator avoidance ( Hermann and Landis , 2017; Lima and Dill , 1990 ) . Such plasticity in certain prey traits may also result in energetic costs ( Lima , 1998 ) . Predator detection is key for these trait changes to occur and can be mediated by chemical , tactile , and visual cues ( Hermann and Thaler , 2014 ) . In mosquitoes , exposure to predators is known to affect a variety of traits including behavior , size , development , and survival ( Arav and Blaustein , 2006; Bond et al . , 2005; Roberts , 2012; Roux et al . , 2015 , Zuharah et al . , 2013 ) . Experimental observations of predator effects on mosquito size and development are inconsistent and results sometimes vary by mosquito sex . For example , exposure to predation was found to increase the size of Culex pipiens mosquitoes ( Alcalay et al . , 2018 ) but decrease the size of Culiseta longiareolata ( Stav et al . , 2005 ) . In addition , female Aedes triseriatus exhibited shorter development times when exposed to predation at high nutrient availability ( Ower and Juliano , 2019 ) , but male C . longiareolata had longer development times in the presence of predators ( Stav et al . , 2005 ) . In some cases , a shared evolutionary history between predator and prey organisms can strengthen the non-consumptive effects of predators on mosquitoes ( Buchanan et al . , 2017; Sih , 1986 ) . This investigation assesses the consumptive and non-consumptive effects of predators on mosquito traits and describes how these effects could impact disease transmission . The roles of vector genus , predator family , mosquito larval instar ( an indicator of prey size ) , and temperature are also examined as potential moderators of predator effects . Non-consumptive effects of predators are expected to cause a smaller reduction in mosquito survival than consumptive effects because , in practice , measures of consumptive effects always include both consumptive and non-consumptive effects . Based on previous findings , larger predators are more likely to consumptively reduce mosquito survival ( Kumar et al . , 2008 ) . In addition , Aedes mosquito larvae may be more vulnerable to consumption than other genera because of the high degree of motility observed in this genus ( Dieng et al . , 2003; Marten and Reid , 2007; Soumare and Cilek , 2011 ) . The oviposition response to predation is expected to be weakest among Aedes species that oviposit above the water line , due in part to their delayed-hatching eggs ( Vonesh and Blaustein , 2010 ) . Predation is predicted to reduce mosquito size and lengthen development time , consistent with the reduced growth response observed in other insect systems ( Hermann and Landis , 2017 ) . Certain non-consumptive effects of predation , particularly oviposition site selection and decreased vector size , are likely to play important roles in the dynamics of mosquito-borne disease . \n A systematic search was conducted for studies on predation of mosquitoes that were published between 1970 and July 1 , 2019 using both PubMed and Web of Science search engines , according to the PRISMA protocol ( Moher et al . , 2009 ) . Mosquito vectors of the Anopheles and Aedes genera were specifically highlighted in our search terms because these genera contain the vector species that transmit malaria , yellow fever , and dengue \u2013 the three most deadly mosquito-borne diseases worldwide ( Hill et al . , 2005 ) . Searches included 18 combinations of three vector predation terms ( mosquito predat* , Anopheles predat* , Aedes predat* ) and six trait terms ( survival , mortality , development , fecundity , dispers* , host preference ) . Abstracts from the 1136 studies were each screened by two different co-authors , using the \u2018metagear\u2019 package in R ( Lajeunesse , 2016 , R Development Core Team , 2020 ) . If either screener thought the study had information relevant to predation of mosquitoes , or both screeners thought the abstract was ambiguous , the study was read in full . This resulted in 306 studies that were fully reviewed to determine if any predation data could be extracted ( Figure 1 ) . Data were extracted from studies that collected data on non-consumptive and/or consumptive effects of predators on mosquitoes . Studies were required to have a mean , error measurement , and at least two replicates for both control and predator treatments . The control treatment was required to have all the same conditions as the predator treatment , such as prey density and type of water , without the predators . Studies that were not published in English and studies that did not differentiate between predators of multiple families were excluded . Studies were also excluded if oviposition by free-flying female mosquitoes could have interfered with observing the consumptive effects of predators on vector survival . The final database comprised data extracted from 60 studies ( Supplementary file 1 ) . The data included observations from laboratory experiments , as well as semi-field experiments , in which mesocosms of different treatments were observed in outdoor settings . Variables related to the publication , the vector , the predator , and the effect size ( Table 1 ) were extracted from each study . Data from tables and text were recorded as they were published , and data from figures were extracted using WebPlotDigitizer ( Rohatgi , 2020 ) . Error measurements that were not originally presented as standard deviations were converted to standard deviations prior to the effect size calculation . A PRISMA plot of literature inclusion and exclusion is provided in Figure 1 . Observations where insecticide was used were excluded because insecticides are known to interfere with consumptive and non-consumptive effects of predators ( Delnat et al . , 2019; Janssens and Stoks , 2012 ) . In addition , observations from experiments with mosquito prey of two or more species were excluded because it was not possible to account for effects from apparent competition or prey-switching . Observations of vector fecundity , vector competence , behavioral traits other than oviposition , as well as observations where the vector trait was marked as \u2018other\u2019 were not analyzed because each of these traits were only recorded from three or fewer studies . Due to protandry , the earlier emergence of males to maximize their reproductive success , mosquitoes respond to sex-specific selective forces that influence their development time and body size ( Kleckner et al . , 1995 ) . Under low resource conditions , female mosquitoes are likely to maximize body mass by extending their development time , whereas males tend to minimize their development time at the expense of lower body mass ( Kleckner et al . , 1995 ) . Observations of mosquito development time and body size in our database that were not sex-specific were excluded so that these vector traits could be analyzed while controlling for sex . In addition , among the observations of development time and body size , some predator means did not necessarily represent an evenly weighted average of the replicates . For example , if a total of 20 mosquitoes from three different predator replicates survived to adulthood , the mean development time and size of those 20 individuals may have been reported . To represent an evenly weighted average of the replicates , it is necessary to first calculate summary statistics among multiple individuals that emerge from the same replicate , and then report the average of the replicate-specific means . Observations that might have been influenced by uneven representation of replicates were excluded to prevent pseudo-replication from altering later meta-analyses . For consumptive observations where life stage-specific survival was reported after more than 10 days of predator exposure , only data on survival marked by adult emergence were included for analysis . Effects observed among immature vector stages after such a long period of predator exposure were not analyzed because they could have resulted from a combination of non-consumptive effects on development , and consumptive effects on survival . Development time observations that were reported as the inverse of development time ( units of days\u20131 ) were excluded because although their means could be converted to units of days , their standard deviations could not be converted to match units of days . In cases where multiple body sections of the same mosquitoes were measured to produce multiple size observations , only the wing measurement was included in the analysis to prevent pseudo-replication . Observations in which both the control and the predator treatments had standard deviations of zero were excluded because the meta-analysis methods did not support non-positive sampling variances . One study that was included in our database reported egg survival data as the hatch rate of field collected Culex pervigilans rafts ( Zuharah et al . , 2013 ) . However , mosquitoes have been shown to lay eggs independent of mating ( O\u2019Meara , 1979 ) , and hatch rates of zero have previously been observed in rafts laid by Culex females that were held separately from males ( Su and Mulla , 1997 ) . Thus , hatch rates of zero were excluded from further analysis because these values may represent unfertilized egg rafts , rather than a strong impact of predators on survival . Twenty of the 187 consumptive survival observations had a predation mean of zero , and each of these zeros resulted from experiments that began with a specified number of live larvae . Consumptive survival zeros were each replaced with 0 . 5% of the starting number of mosquito prey to avoid undefined effect sizes . In addition , there was one zero out of the 36 oviposition predation means; this value had units of \u2018number of egg rafts laid\u2019 and was replaced with 0 . 5 rafts . Similar methods for replacing zero values in the treatment mean with small non-zero values have previously been employed ( Thapa et al . , 2018 ) . The final analysis dataset included seven subsets: consumptive effects on survival , non-consumptive effects on survival , oviposition , development ( female and male ) , and size ( female and male ) . The data included 187 observations from 34 studies of consumptive survival , 24 observations from seven studies of non-consumptive survival , 36 observations from 12 studies of oviposition , 14 observations from seven studies of female development , 14 observations from seven studies of male development , 27 observations from 10 studies of female size , and 18 observations from nine studies of male size ( Figure 1 ) . These observations covered seven different classes of predator families ( Figure 2 ) . \n Each data subset ( Figure 1 ) had an I2 statistic of greater than 75% , indicating high heterogeneity ( Higgins et al . , 2003 ) . Random effects model results showed that predators consumptively decreased mosquito survival with an effect size of \u20131 . 23 ( 95% CI \u22121 . 43 , \u20131 . 03 ) , p-value < 0 . 0001 , and non-consumptively reduced survival with a smaller effect size of \u20130 . 11 ( 95% CI \u22120 . 17 , \u20130 . 04 ) , p-value = 0 . 0016 . In addition , predators non-consumptively reduced oviposition behavior with an effect size of \u20130 . 87 ( 95% CI \u22121 . 31 , \u20130 . 42 ) , p-value = 0 . 0001 , and mosquito body size was non-consumptively reduced by predators in both males and females; the female effect size was \u20130 . 13 ( 95% CI \u22120 . 19 , \u20130 . 06 ) , p-value = 0 . 0002 , and the male effect size was \u20130 . 03 ( 95% CI \u22120 . 06 , \u20130 . 01 ) , p-value = 0 . 0184 . There was not a significant non-consumptive effect of predators on either male or female development time; the female effect size was \u20130 . 01 ( 95% CI \u20130 . 09 , 0 . 07 ) , p-value = 0 . 7901 , and the male effect size was \u20130 . 04 ( 95% CI \u20130 . 12 , 0 . 04 ) , p-value = 0 . 3273 . The Egger\u2019s regression test results showed that the non-consumptive survival subset , both development time subsets ( male and female ) , and the female size subset exhibited funnel plot asymmetry indicative of publication bias . The \u2018trim and fill\u2019 procedure identified missing studies in the non-consumptive survival subset and the female size subset , but the procedure did not identify any missing studies in either of the development time subsets . Three studies were estimated to be missing from the non-consumptive survival data , and accounting for imputed values from missing studies resulted in a shift in the predation effect size from \u20130 . 11 ( 95% CI \u22120 . 17 , \u20130 . 04 ) , p-value = 0 . 0016 , to -0 . 13 ( 95% CI \u22120 . 20 , \u20130 . 07 ) , p-value < 0 . 0001 . Two studies were estimated to be missing from the female size data , and accounting for imputed values from these missing studies shifted the predation effect size from \u20130 . 13 ( 95% CI \u22120 . 19 , \u20130 . 06 ) , p-value = 0 . 0002 , to -0 . 10 ( 95% CI \u22120 . 17 , \u20130 . 03 ) , p-value = 0 . 0083 . Shifts in effect size estimates due to the trim and fill procedure were minor and did not cause any of the observed effects of predators to change direction or become insignificant . The consumptive survival and oviposition data subsets met the criteria of high heterogeneity , observations from at least 10 studies , and no evidence of publication bias . Therefore , these data subsets were tested for moderators using multilevel mixed effects models . Predator families that decreased mosquito survival included Cyprinidae: \u20133 . 44 ( 95% CI \u22125 . 79 , \u20131 . 09 ) , p-value = 0 . 0042; Poeciliidae: \u20131 . 42 ( 95% CI \u22122 . 67 , \u20130 . 16 ) , p-value = 0 . 0270; Ambystomatidae: \u20135 . 18 ( 95% CI \u22127 . 94 , \u20132 . 42 ) , p-value = 0 . 0002; Aeshnidae: \u20132 . 93 ( 95% CI \u22124 . 80 , \u20131 . 07 ) , p-value = 0 . 0020; and Notonectidae: \u20132 . 14 ( 95% CI \u22123 . 07 , \u20131 . 21 ) , p-value < 0 . 0001 ( Figure 3a ) . Vector genera that experienced significant decreases in survival due to consumptive effects of predators included Aedes: \u20131 . 23 ( 95% CI \u22121 . 81 , \u20130 . 65 ) , p-value < 0 . 0001; Anopheles: \u20131 . 34 ( 95% CI \u22122 . 01 , \u20130 . 66 ) , p-value = 0 . 0001; and Culex: \u20131 . 41 ( 95% CI \u22121 . 96 , \u20130 . 86 ) , p-value < 0 . 0001 ( Figure 3b ) . Among all 187 consumptive survival observations from 34 studies , the best model fit , according to AICc value , was achieved when an interaction between predator family and vector genus was included in the model ( Table 2 ) . However , among the 163 larval stage consumptive survival observations from 30 studies , adding an interactive term between larval instar ( an indicator of prey size ) and predator family had a greater improvement on model fit than adding an interactive term between vector genus and predator family ( Figure 3c , Table 3 ) . Temperature did not affect the heterogeneity of consumptive survival data , either as a linear moderator: \u20130 . 01 ( 95% CI \u20130 . 10 , 0 . 07 ) , p-value = 0 . 7559 , or a quadratic moderator: 0 . 00 ( 95% CI 0 . 00 , 0 . 00 ) , p-value = 0 . 8184 . The best oviposition model fit , according to AICc value , was achieved when vector genus was added as a moderator ( Table 4 ) . The mean oviposition effect size was not significantly different than zero for Aedes: 0 . 32 ( 95% CI \u20132 . 14 , 2 . 79 ) , p-value = 0 . 7970 , or Culiseta: \u20130 . 61 ( 95% CI \u20131 . 83 , 0 . 62 ) , p-value = 0 . 3329 , but for Culex mosquitoes , oviposition was significantly decreased by predator presence: \u20131 . 69 ( 95% CI \u22122 . 82 , \u20130 . 56 ) , p-value = 0 . 0033 ( Figure 4 ) . \n Several larger predators reduced mosquito survival , including freshwater fish ( Cyprinidae and Poeciliidae ) , salamander larvae ( Ambystomatidae ) , dragonfly larvae ( Aeshnidae ) , and backswimmers ( Notonectidae ) ( Figure 3a ) . This finding is consistent with a previous analysis which showed a positive linear relationship between predator body mass and ingestion rate across taxa ( Peters , 1983 ) . In addition , more effect size heterogeneity in the consumptive survival data was explained by an interaction between predator family and larval instar than was explained by an interaction between predator family and vector genus ( Table 3 ) . This result suggests that the relative sizes of predator and prey groups could play a more important role in determining consumptive mosquito survival than variations in predator responses to different behaviors of prey genera , which are likely to be shaped by the degree of shared evolutionary history between trophic levels ( Buchanan et al . , 2017 ) . Larval instar is an indicator of mosquito size , and previous modeling work has provided evidence of prey size selection by predators to maximize energetic gain ( Mittelbach , 1981 ) . While smaller cyclopoid copepods are more effective against early instar mosquito larvae ( Dieng et al . , 2002 ) , larger predators including tadpoles , giant water bugs , dragonfly larvae , fish , and backswimmers are more effective against late instar larvae ( Kweka et al . , 2011 ) . Exposure to predation cues significantly lowered mosquito survival , and this non-consumptive effect has also been observed in dragonfly larvae prey ( Leucorrhinia intacta ) that were exposed to caged predators ( McCauley et al . , 2011 ) . The reduction in mosquito survival from non-consumptive effects of predators was significantly smaller than the reduction that was observed from consumptive effects . This is partially due to the practical constraints of most experimental designs , which cause consumptive and non-consumptive effects of predators on survival to be grouped together and reported as consumptive effects . The greater impact of combined consumptive and non-consumptive effects , in comparison to only non-consumptive effects , has previously been observed in pea aphids ( Acyrthosiphon pisum ) ( Nelson et al . , 2004 ) . While predators did not significantly impact mosquito development time through non-consumptive effects in either sex , mosquito body size was decreased by the non-consumptive effects of predators in both sexes . Smaller body size is associated with lower reproductive success in mosquitoes because smaller females lay fewer eggs ( Blackmore and Lord , 2000; Lyimo and Takken , 1993; Oliver and Howard , 2011; Styer et al . , 2007; Tsunoda et al . , 2010 ) , and smaller males produce less sperm ( Hatala et al . , 2018; Ponlawat and Harrington , 2007 ) . These effects suggest that predation could non-consumptively reduce mosquito population growth . The smaller size of mosquitoes exposed to predators could also limit disease transmission . Vector lifespan contributes disproportionately to disease transmission because older vectors are more likely to have been exposed to pathogens , more likely to already be infectious after having survived the extrinsic incubation period , and more likely to survive long enough to bite subsequent hosts ( Cator et al . , 2020 ) . It is well-established that smaller mosquito body size is associated with shorter mosquito lifespan ( Ara\u00fajo et al . , 2012; Hawley , 1985 , Reisen et al . , 1984; Reiskind and Lounibos , 2009; Xue et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , non-consumptive effects of predators may limit the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases . Predator presence also non-consumptively reduced oviposition behavior in adult female mosquitoes . Meta-regression results showed that Culex females significantly avoid oviposition sites that contain predators or predator cues , but Aedes and Culiseta females do not avoid these sites , despite a slight non-significant trend toward predator avoidance in Culiseta ( Figure 4 ) . Both Culex and Culiseta mosquitoes have an \u2018all-or-none\u2019 oviposition strategy ( Johnson and Fonseca , 2014 ) , in which they lay hundreds of rapidly hatching eggs in rafts on the water\u2019s surface ( Day , 2016 ) . Such an oviposition strategy is conducive to evolving predator avoidance behaviors , and a previous meta-analysis showed significant predator avoidance in both Culex and Culiseta during oviposition ( Vonesh and Blaustein , 2010 ) . Conversely , it is likely that an oviposition response to predation is not particularly advantageous for Aedes because the delayed hatching of their eggs ( Day , 2016 ) can prevent the level of predation risk at the time of oviposition from matching the level of predation risk present in the eventual larval environment ( Vonesh and Blaustein , 2010 ) . The predator avoidance response in Aedes species that lay their eggs above the water\u2019s edge in containers has previously been described as \u2018non-existent\u2019 ( Vonesh and Blaustein , 2010 ) . Both Aedes species included in this study\u2019s oviposition data subset , Ae . albopictus and Ae . aegypti , meet the criterion of ovipositing above water in containers ( Juliano , 2009 ) . Predator avoidance during oviposition has previously been found to increase the mosquito population size at equilibrium ( Spencer et al . , 2002 ) . However , this study\u2019s results and those of a previous meta-analysis ( Vonesh and Blaustein , 2010 ) suggest that models of oviposition site selection , such as those using parameters from Notonectidae predators and Culiseta prey ( Kershenbaum et al . , 2012 ) , are not generalizable to Aedes vectors . Predator avoidance during oviposition by Culex mosquitoes ( Figure 4 ) may be of particular importance to West Nile virus ( WNV ) disease dynamics . Previous work has shown that Cx . pipiens , Cx . restuans , and Cx . tarsalis all avoid predator habitats ( Vonesh and Blaustein , 2010 ) , and that Cx . pipiens is the primary bridge vector of WNV responsible for spill-over transmission from avian reservoir hosts to humans ( Fonseca et al . , 2004; Hamer et al . , 2008a , Kramer et al . , 2008; Andreadis , 2012 ) . Cx . pipiens mosquitoes can live in permanent aquatic environments , such as ground pools ( Amini et al . , 2020; Barr , 1967; Dida et al . , 2018; Sulesco et al . , 2015 ) , ponds ( L\u00fchken et al . , 2015 ) , stream edges ( Amini et al . , 2020 ) , and lake edges ( Vinogradova , 2000 ) that are more common in rural areas , but Cx . pipiens are also found in urban and suburban residential areas , where they typically breed in artificial containers ( Sulesco et al . , 2015 ) , including tires ( L\u00fchken et al . , 2015; Nikookar et al . , 2017; Verna , 2015 ) , rainwater tanks ( Townroe and Callaghan , 2014 ) , and catch basins ( Gardner et al . , 2012 ) . Small artificial containers , such as discarded tires , are generally unlikely to harbor larger predators , including freshwater fish ( Cyprinidae and Poeciliidae ) , salamander larvae ( Ambystomatidae ) , dragonfly larvae ( Aeshnidae ) , and backswimmers ( Notonectidae ) , because temporary aquatic environments cannot support the relatively long development times of these organisms . The mean dispersal distance of adult Culex mosquitoes is greater than one kilometer ( Ciota et al . , 2012; Hamer et al . , 2014 ) , and female Cx . pipiens have exhibited longer dispersal distances after developing in the presence of a fish predator ( Alcalay et al . , 2018 ) . Therefore , predator avoidance during oviposition may cause Cx . pipiens populations to disperse from permanent aquatic environments in more rural areas to artificial container environments in urbanized areas , where the risk of human WNV infection is higher ( Brown et al . , 2008 ) . Predator cue levels may be altered by climate conditions , and these changes in cue levels can impact WNV transmission to humans . Drought has previously been associated with human WNV cases ( Johnson and Sukhdeo , 2013; Marcantonio et al . , 2015; Roehr , 2012; Shaman et al . , 2005; Epstein and Defilippo , 2001; Paull et al . , 2017 ) , but the association has thus far lacked a clear underlying mechanism . Under drought conditions , the density of aquatic organisms increases and predation pressures can intensify due to compressed space and high encounter rates ( Amundrud et al . , 2019 ) . A previous study of a stream ecosystem found that impacts of fish predation are more severe during the dry season ( Dudgeon , 1993 ) . In addition , reductions in water volume can facilitate consumption of mosquito larvae by crane fly larvae ( Tipulidae ) , whereas mosquito consumption by tipulids was not observed at a higher water level ( Amundrud et al . , 2019 ) . Laboratory and semi-field studies have shown that mosquitoes respond to a gradient of predator cues ( Roux et al . , 2014; Silberbush and Blaustein , 2011 ) . The frequency of larval anti-predator behavior is correlated with the concentration of predator cues ( Roux et al . , 2014 ) , and adult female mosquitoes prefer oviposition sites with lower predator densities ( Silberbush and Blaustein , 2011 ) . Therefore , as predator cue levels increase due to drought , permanent aquatic habitats are likely to transition from suitable oviposition sites for one generation of female mosquitoes , to unsuitable oviposition sites for the next generation . When suitable oviposition sites are absent , females retain their eggs until sites become available ( Bentley and Day , 1989 ) . Cx . pipiens females can retain their eggs for up to five weeks , allowing them enough time to find container sites with low predation risk , often located in residential areas ( Johnson and Fonseca , 2014 ) . The movement of gravid female Cx . pipiens to residential areas increases the risk of WNV spill-over to humans because these vectors are likely to have already blood-fed at least once ( Clements , 1992 ) , suggesting that they have a higher risk of WNV infection , relative to non-gravid mosquitoes . This is consistent with studies that have reported associations between drought and WNV-infected mosquitoes in urban and residential areas ( Johnson and Sukhdeo , 2013; Paull et al . , 2017 ) . In addition , vertical transmission of WNV from gravid females to their progeny may occur during oviposition ( Rosen , 1988 ) , when the virus is transmitted by an accessory gland fluid that attaches eggs to one another ( Nelms et al . , 2013 ) . Because the rate of vertical transmission in Cx . pipiens increases with the number of days following WNV infection ( Anderson et al . , 2008 ) , extended searches for oviposition sites due to drought could increase the frequency of vertical transmission . However , the impact of vertical transmission on WNV epidemics is thought to be minimal because when transmission to an egg raft did occur , only 4 . 7% of the progeny were found to be infected as adults ( Anderson et al . , 2008 ) , and only about half of those infected adults are estimated to be female . In summary , the movement of Cx . pipiens females toward more residential areas , combined with potential limited WNV amplification from increased vertical transmission , suggests that the vector trait of predator avoidance during oviposition can serve as a plausible explanation for associations between drought and human WNV cases . Another theory for the association between drought and human WNV cases is based on the hypothesis that increased contact between mosquito vectors and passerine reservoir hosts occurs during drought conditions ( Paull et al . , 2017; Shaman et al . , 2005 ) . The proposed aggregation of bird and mosquito populations during drought was originally thought to occur in humid , densely vegetated hammocks \u2013 a type of habitat that is specific to southern Florida ( Shaman et al . , 2005 ) , but WNV incidence is more consistently clustered in other regions of the US , particularly the Northern Great Plains ( CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION , 2021; Sugumaran et al . , 2009 ) . Northern cardinals ( Cardinalis cardinalis ) , American robins ( Turdus migratorius ) , and house sparrows ( Passer domesticus ) were among the bird species that most frequently tested seropositive for WNV antibodies in 2005 and 2006 in Chicago , where high numbers of human cases were reported ( Hamer et al . , 2008b ) , and these passerine species are more abundant in residential areas , regardless of precipitation patterns ( Anderson , 2006b; Beddall , 1963; Lepczyk et al . , 2008 ) . Apart from drought , landowners\u2019 participation in supplemental bird feeding , providing bird houses , gardening , and maintaining vegetation can strongly influence passerine abundance in residential areas ( Lepczyk et al . , 2004 ) . Furthermore , as terrestrial foragers that can obtain hydration from their diet of insects , fruits , and other plant material ( Anderson , 2006a; Brzek et al . , 2009; Malmborg and Willson , 1988; Renne et al . , 2000 ) , passerine reservoir hosts of WNV are less likely to move in response to drought than the mosquito vectors of WNV , which have obligate aquatic life stages . While hatch-year birds are more vulnerable to mosquito biting , and thus contribute to the amplification of WNV ( Hamer et al . , 2008b ) , it is illogical to expect an increased abundance of hatch-year birds during drought conditions . However , some have argued that in cases where drought decreases the abundance of juvenile birds , the ratio of mosquitoes to birds increases , and this could lead to higher WNV prevalence in the mosquito population ( Paull et al . , 2017 ) . Although reductions in both hatching success ( George et al . , 1992 ) and survival of recently fledged birds ( Yackel Adams et al . , 2006 ) have been observed during drought conditions , the impact of drought on avian abundance varies widely by species ( Verner and Purcell , 1999 ) . In particular , synanthropic species , such as those likely to harbor WNV , are less negatively affected by drought ( Albright et al . , 2009 ) . Additionally , the droughts that impact avian abundance often occur over much longer periods of time than the seasonal droughts that predict WNV transmission to humans . For example , avian abundance has been modeled based on precipitation metrics spanning 32 weeks , and house wren ( Troglodytes aedon ) abundance has been predicted by precipitation averages spanning four years ( Verner and Purcell , 1999 ) . Finally , birds with higher levels of stress hormones are more likely to be fed on by mosquitoes , and certain factors associated with residential areas , such as road noise , light pollution , and pesticide exposure , can cause avian stress ( Gervasi et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , elevated avian stress hormones in these habitats may contribute to WNV prevalence in the mosquito population , independent of drought conditions . Although the aquatic phase of the mosquito life cycle is often overlooked in mathematical models of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission ( Reiner et al . , 2013 ) , vector survival at immature stages plays an important role in determining mosquito population abundance , which is an essential factor for predicting disease transmission ( Beck-Johnson et al . , 2013 ) . The results of this study show that mosquito survival decreases among the Aedes , Anopheles , and Culex genera due to consumptive effects of predators ( Figure 3b ) , and that there is also a reduction in mosquito survival due to non-consumptive effects . Other studies have demonstrated that aquatic predators dramatically impact mosquito survival and abundance . For example , a biocontrol intervention relying on the application of copepod predators eliminated Aedes albopictus from three communes in Nam Dinh , Vietnam , where dengue transmission was previously detected , and reduced vector abundance by 86\u201398% in three other communes ( Kay et al . , 2002 ) . Conversely , the annual abundance of Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes was observed to increase 15-fold in semi-permanent wetlands in the year following a drought , likely because the drought eliminated aquatic predators from wetlands that dried completely , and mosquitoes were able to re-colonize newly formed aquatic habitats more quickly than their most effective predators ( Chase and Knight , 2003 ) . While relationships between temperature and different vector traits , such as fecundity and lifespan , have been incorporated into models of temperature effects on mosquito population density ( El Moustaid and Johnson , 2019 ) , models of predator effects on vector borne disease transmission have focused primarily on the impacts of predation on vector survival . Previous models have shown that predators of vector species can decrease or eliminate pathogen infection in host populations as vector fecundity increases ( Moore et al . , 2010 ) . The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that predators also decrease vector fecundity through non-consumptive effects on vector body size . In addition , the entomological inoculation rate ( EIR ) is likely to be reduced by effects of predators on mosquito fecundity and lifespan , as well as effects of predators on mosquito survival . The EIR has been defined as the product of three variables: ( m ) the number of mosquitoes per host , ( a ) the daily rate of mosquito biting , and ( s ) the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious ( Beck-Johnson et al . , 2013 ) . Based on this study\u2019s findings , predators are likely to decrease the number of mosquitoes per host by reducing mosquito survival through both consumptive and non-consumptive effects , and by reducing mosquito fecundity through non-consumptive effects on body size . In addition , predators are likely to decrease the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious by shortening the vector lifespan through non-consumptive effects on body size . The relationship between mosquito body size and biting rate is unclear , with some studies showing higher biting rates among larger mosquitoes ( Ara\u00fajo et al . , 2012; Gunathilaka et al . , 2019 ) , and others reporting higher biting rates among smaller mosquitoes ( Farjana and Tuno , 2013; Leisnham et al . , 2008 ) . The links between factors that influence the EIR and observed effects of predators on mosquito prey demonstrate the necessity of including both consumptive and non-consumptive effects of predators in models of mosquito-borne disease . This meta-analysis on mosquito predation demonstrates that predators not only play an important role in directly reducing mosquito populations , but also have non-consumptive effects on surviving mosquitoes that may ultimately reduce further population growth and decrease disease transmission . While families of larger sized predators were effective in reducing mosquito survival , other factors , such as impacts on native species , as well as the economic cost of mass-rearing and field applications ( Kumar and Hwang , 2006; Pyke , 2008 ) , should be carefully considered before selecting a predator as a suitable biocontrol agent . Predictive disease models are likely to be more reliable when the non-consumptive effects of predation are incorporated . Although exposure of mosquito larvae to predators is commonplace in outdoor field settings , it remains rare in most laboratory-based assessments of vector traits . Therefore , mosquitoes observed in nature are likely to have smaller body sizes than those observed under optimal laboratory conditions . It is important for disease modelers to recognize these impacts of predation on vector traits as they can reduce mosquito population growth and limit disease transmission due to shorter vector lifespans . Within the WNV disease system , consideration of the oviposition behavioral response to predation cues by Culex vectors can improve current understanding of the association between drought and human cases . This study provides general estimates of the effects of predators on selected mosquito traits for use in predictive disease models . Modeling efforts that aim to optimize the application of biocontrol predators should also consider incorporating predator effects on vector survival , fecundity , and lifespan . These additions to predictive models of various biocontrol interventions are likely to help public health officials choose the most cost-effective strategies for limiting disease transmission . In the 60-study database that was compiled , only one study was designed to directly measure the effect of larval-stage predation on vector competence ( Roux et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , future efforts to assess the impact of predators on mosquito-borne disease transmission should prioritize experimental studies in which infected mosquito larvae are observed throughout an initial period of aquatic exposure to predators , followed by a period of blood-feeding in the adult stage . Two studies from the compiled database examined the compatibility of predators with Bacillus thuringiensis var . israelensis ( Bti ) , a commonly used bacterial biocontrol agent ( Chansang et al . , 2004; Op de Beeck et al . , 2016 ) . Previous studies have supported the simultaneous application of cyclopoid copepod predators and Bti ( Marten et al . , 1993; Tietze et al . , 1994 ) , but additional analyses are needed on the use of Bti with other families of mosquito predators . Populations of other insect pests , such as the southern green stink bug ( Nezara viridula ) , are known to be regulated by both predators and parasites ( Ehler , 2002 ) . The literature search conducted for this meta-analysis returned studies on water mite parasites ( Rajendran and Prasad , 1994 ) and nematode parasitoids ( de Valdez , 2006 ) of mosquitoes , and ascogregarine parasites have previously been evaluated as biocontrol agents against Aedes mosquitoes ( Tseng , 2007 ) . A more thorough review of the impacts of parasites and parasitoids on vector traits , such as survival , fecundity , and lifespan , is needed before incorporating these potential biocontrol agents into integrated vector control plans . Three studies in the 60-study database included experiments where two mosquito prey species were made available to the predator species ( Grill and Juliano , 1996; Griswold and Lounibos , 2005 , Micieli et al . , 2002 ) . In these cases , the effect size measurement for each mosquito species could be influenced by interspecific competition , or a preference of the predator species for a certain prey species . Hetero-specific prey observations were excluded from this meta-analysis , but future analyses centered on the concepts of interspecific competition or predator preferences might further evaluate these data . In addition , this meta-analysis investigated consumptive and non-consumptive effects of predators separately . More research is needed to determine how models should combine these different types of predator effects to accurately reflect predation interactions as they occur in natural environments ."}

Specifically , mutations in their genome cause influenza proteins to change in ways that can help the virus evade our defences . However , these mutations come at a cost and can prevent the viral proteins from forming functional and stable three-dimensional shapes \u2013 a process known as protein folding \u2013 thereby hampering the virus\u2019 ability to replicate . In human cells , proteins called chaperones can help our other proteins fold properly . Influenza viruses do not have their own chaperones and , instead , hijack those of their host . Host chaperones are therefore crucial to the virus\u2019 ability to replicate . However , until now , it was not known if host chaperones can influence how these viruses evolve . Here , Phillips et al . used mammalian cells to study how host chaperones affect an evolving influenza population . First , cells were engineered to either have normal chaperone levels , elevated chaperone levels , or inactive chaperones . Next , the H3N2 influenza strain was grown in these different conditions for nearly 200 generations and sequenced to determine how the virus evolved in each distinctive host chaperone environment . Phillips et al . discovered that host chaperones affect the rate at which mutations accumulate in the influenza population , and also the types of mutations in the influenza genome . For instance , when a chaperone called Hsp90 was inactivated , mutations became prevalent in the viral population more slowly than in cells with normal or elevated chaperone levels . Moreover , some specific mutations fared better in cells with high chaperone levels , whilst others worked better in cells with inactivated chaperones . These results suggest that influenza evolution is affected by host chaperone levels in complex and important ways . Moreover , whether chaperones will promote or hinder the effects of any single mutation is difficult to predict ahead of time . This discovery is significant , as the chaperones available to influenza can vary in different tissues , organisms and infectious conditions , and may therefore influence the virus' ability to change and evolve in a context-specific manner . The findings are likely to extend to other viruses such as HIV and Ebola , which also hijack host chaperones for the same purpose . More work is now needed to systematically quantify these effects so that we can better predict how specific chaperones will affect the ability of viruses to adapt , especially in pathologically relevant conditions like fever or viral host-switching . In the future , such insights could help shape the design of treatments to which viruses do not evolve resistance .", "source": "Predicting and constraining RNA virus evolution require understanding the molecular factors that define the mutational landscape accessible to these pathogens . RNA viruses typically have high mutation rates , resulting in frequent production of protein variants with compromised biophysical properties . Their evolution is necessarily constrained by the consequent challenge to protein folding and function . We hypothesized that host proteostasis mechanisms may be significant determinants of the fitness of viral protein variants , serving as a critical force shaping viral evolution . Here , we test that hypothesis by propagating influenza in host cells displaying chemically-controlled , divergent proteostasis environments . We find that both the nature of selection on the influenza genome and the accessibility of specific mutational trajectories are significantly impacted by host proteostasis . These findings provide new insights into features of host\u2013pathogen interactions that shape viral evolution , and into the potential design of host proteostasis-targeted antiviral therapeutics that are refractory to resistance . \n Minimalist pathogens like RNA viruses survive dynamic host environments by virtue of their extreme adaptability . This adaptability is driven by a high rate of genetic variation , mediated by error-prone genome replication ( Sanju\u00e1n et al . , 2010 ) . Most missense mutations have deleterious consequences for protein function , often owing to either thermodynamic ( reduced stability of the native state or enhanced stability of unfolded/misfolded states ) or kinetic ( slow folding or enhanced misfolding/aggregation ) effects on folding ( DePristo et al . , 2005 ) . In the context of viruses , these phenomena may underpin the observation that the distribution of mutational fitness effects can be largely accounted for by considering protein folding biophysics ( Wylie and Shakhnovich , 2011; Ch\u00e9ron et al . , 2016; Tokuriki and Tawfik , 2009a ) . Indeed , stable proteins tend to be more evolvable , as any given missense mutation is less likely to severely disrupt protein folding or structure ( Bloom et al . , 2006; Gong et al . , 2013 ) . In cells , protein folding challenges are addressed by proteostasis networks composed of chaperones and quality control factors that work in concert to shepherd nascent proteins to folded , functional conformations ( Balch et al . , 2008; Hartl et al . , 2011; Powers and Balch , 2013 ) . Important work focused primarily on the Hsp90 chaperone has suggested a critical role for chaperones in modulating the evolution of their endogenous clients , ( Cowen and Lindquist , 2005; Queitsch et al . , 2002; Lachowiec et al . , 2015; Sangster et al . , 2007 , 2008a , 2008b; Rohner et al . , 2013; Whitesell et al . , 2014; Geiler-Samerotte et al . , 2016; Rutherford and Lindquist , 1998 ) in part by buffering deleterious effects of non-synonymous mutations . The consequences of Hsp90 activity for protein evolution may be due to Hsp90 directly engaging an evolving client protein ( termed a primary effect ) . Alternatively , the effects of Hsp90 may be secondary , mediated indirectly by Hsp90 influencing the folding of other endogenous clients that themselves engage relevant evolving proteins . For instance , Hsp90-dependent azole resistance in Candida albicans is mediated by secondary effects of Hsp90 on calcineurin , an Hsp90 client that regulates responses to environmental stimuli ( Cowen and Lindquist , 2005 ) . Efforts to look beyond Hsp90 to understand how other components of the metazoan proteostasis machinery modulate evolution ( e . g . , Hsp40/70 chaperones or protein misfolding stress responses like the heat shock response ) have been slowed by the paucity of chemical biology tools to perturb the activities of these systems . However , Tawfik and coworkers have shown that the GroEL/ES chaperonin system can govern the fitness of certain client protein variants in bacteria ( Tokuriki and Tawfik , 2009b ) , and computational modeling suggests that other chaperones may also have roles in evolution ( Bogumil and Dagan , 2012; Cetinba\u015f and Shakhnovich , 2013 ) . Chaperones and other proteostasis mechanisms are theoretically well-positioned to address the biophysical challenges created by high mutation rates in viruses . Intriguingly , most RNA viruses lack autonomous chaperones or other co-factors to assist\u00a0their proteins\u00a0with folding . Instead , viral proteins engage host chaperones , ( Melville et al . , 1999; Momose et al . , 2002; Naito et al . , 2007; York et al . , 2014; Watanabe et al . , 2010 ) and host chaperone inhibitors have been shown to limit the viability of certain RNA viruses ( Geller et al . , 2007; Heaton et al . , 2016; Taguwa et al . , 2015; Chase et al . , 2008; Geller et al . , 2012 ) . However , the possibility that host chaperones can shape the evolution of viral pathogens has not been investigated . In summary , it is clear that: ( 1 ) high genetic variability is essential to support RNA virus adaptability; ( 2 ) missense mutations important for viral adaptation are often biophysically\u00a0deleterious , constraining the accessible mutational landscape; and ( 3 ) many viruses engage host chaperones to fold their proteins . An important but still untested hypothesis is that host proteostasis modulates RNA virus evolutionary trajectories . Experimentally testing this hypothesis requires methods to regulate the host cell\u2019s proteostasis network without significantly perturbing cell health or the ability of an RNA virus to propagate . Here , we achieve this goal in the context of long-term influenza propagation by using small molecules to either modulate the heat shock response in a stress-independent manner ( Shoulders et al . , 2013; Moore et al . , 2016 ) or to inhibit Hsp90 at sub-lethal concentrations ( Ying et al . , 2012 ) . We find that the resulting perturbations to host proteostasis mechanisms significantly impact both the extent and the nature of selection pressure on the influenza genome . We conclude that host proteostasis is a critical , under-appreciated player in influenza evolution , with significant implications for our ability to predict and prevent the evolution of influenza and other RNA viral pathogens . \n Eukaryotic cells dynamically match proteostasis network capacity to demand via compartment-specific stress responses . Thus , one biologically relevant strategy to create an altered proteostasis environment is to induce such responses . We focused on the heat shock response , ( \u00c5kerfelt et al . , 2010 ) because numerous influenza proteins must fold and/or function in the cytosol and nucleus ( Watanabe et al . , 2010 ) . Typical methods to induce heat shock factor 1 ( HSF1 ) , the master regulator of the heat shock response and thus of cytosolic and nuclear chaperone and quality control protein levels , involve treatment with toxins or acute heat stress . These methods are not useful for our studies because they engender massive protein misfolding stress in host cells that rapidly become apoptotic , preventing influenza propagation . An alternative strategy is to over-express a constitutively active form of HSF1 lacking amino acids 186\u2013202 ( termed cHSF1 ) , ( Voellmy , 2005 ) but high levels of cHSF1 over-expression outside the physiologically relevant regime are typically toxic ( Ryno et al . , 2014 ) . Instead , we took a chemical genetic approach , fusing cHSF1 to a destabilized variant of E . coli dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) ( Shoulders et al . , 2013; Iwamoto et al . , 2010 ) . The DHFR . cHSF1 fusion is targeted for rapid proteasomal degradation and is therefore non-functional ( Figure 1A ) , unless cells are treated with the DHFR-stabilizing pharmacologic chaperone trimethoprim ( TMP ) . We created a stable , clonal Madin Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cell line expressing DHFR . cHSF1 . In these cells , termed MDCKHSF1 cells , we can dosably induce cHSF1 transcriptional activity by TMP treatment in a stress-independent manner within the biologically relevant regime ( Figure 1B ) , avoiding cytotoxicity that would be induced by stressors or cHSF1 overexpression and yet still providing robust access to cells expressing enhanced levels of HSF1 targets ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C ) . To control for any possible unintended consequences of TMP treatment or expression of a DHFR-fusion protein in our evolution experiments , we also created a control MDCK cell line expressing DHFR . YFP ( MDCKYFP ) . This MDCKYFP cell line does not display TMP-dependent upregulation of HSF1-dependent chaperones , indicating that TMP induces HSF1 activity in our MDCKHSF1 cells specifically by stabilizing DHFR . cHSF1 ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . A second approach to create an altered folding environment is to inhibit individual chaperones . Here , we employed the Hsp90 inhibitor STA-9090 , a small molecule capable of targeting multiple Hsp90 isoforms ( Ying et al . , 2012 ) . Notably , Hsp90 inhibition using high concentrations of STA-9090 can cause an undesirable compensatory heat shock response ( Moore et al . , 2016 ) , resulting in activation of HSF1 and upregulation of Hsp70 , Hsp40 , and other HSF1 targets . Such compensatory HSF1 activation would convolute interpretation of our results . Thus , we treated with the highest possible STA-9090 concentration that does not induce a compensatory heat shock response in MDCK cells . We selected the concentration used via a functional assay for all experiments , examining Hsp70 protein levels by immunoblotting to ensure the absence of any heat shock response signature ( Figure 1C ) . To confirm that we are still engaging Hsp90 at the low STA-9090 concentration used in our serial passaging experiments , we performed a cellular thermal shift assay ( Martinez Molina et al . , 2013 ) and observed a small but highly reproducible increase in Hsp90 thermal stability upon STA-9090 treatment ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . Because Hsp90 inhibition can be employed in our MDCKHSF1 cell line , these methods access three distinctive host proteostasis environments in a single cell line dependent only on small molecule treatment . The use of just a single cell line for experiments ( MDCKHSF1 ) and for controls ( MDCKYFP ) minimizes any possible cell line-dependent bias in our evolution experiments . Importantly , monitoring chaperone levels in the context of influenza A/Wuhan/1995 ( H3N2 ) infection shows that , under our infection conditions , influenza itself neither induces heat shock protein transcripts nor interferes with our method to activate HSF1 . Thus , we have full user control of the host proteostasis environment during a progressing infection ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . To further characterize these perturbed host environments , we performed RNA-Seq for each treatment in the MDCKHSF1 and MDCKYFP cell lines . We observed a total of only 118 transcripts whose expression is altered\u00a0\u22652 fold with a p-value\u00a0<10\u20135 in any one or more of the treatments employed , indicating that we are remodeling only a small portion of the transcriptome ( comprehensive quality control and RNA-Seq results are provided in Figure 2\u2014source data 1\u20132 ) . A heat map for these 118 genes highlights that two distinctive cellular environments are indeed created by HSF1 activation and Hsp90 inhibition in MDCKHSF1 cells ( Figure 2A ) . Moreover , only two transcripts meet these cutoffs upon TMP treatment in MDCKYFP cells , confirming that the remodeled proteostasis environment upon TMP treatment of MDCKHSF1 cells is specifically due to HSF1 activation . The volcano plots in Figure 2B show the distribution of differentially expressed genes for HSF1 activation and Hsp90 inhibition in MDCKHSF1 cells , relative to the basal environment , with selected transcripts labeled ( for a list of all transcripts meeting these thresholds see Figure 2\u2014source data 3 ) . As expected , stress-independent HSF1 activation upregulates numerous classic heat shock response genes ( Ryno et al . , 2014 ) , including HSP70 , BAG3 , HSP90AA1 , DNAJB1 , and FKBP4 ( Figure 2B ) . This remodeling of the cellular proteostasis network is limited to nuclear and cytosolic proteostasis mechanisms , as ER proteostasis network components are not induced by TMP treatment of the MDCKHSF1 cells ( Figure 2C ) . Moreover , transcript-level proteostasis network remodeling is not observed upon STA-9090 treatment , with the exception of a 2 . 2-fold induction of HSPB1 , as expected given the low concentration of inhibitor employed . We observe modest upregulation of several transcripts involved in transcription factor regulation and DNA damage upon HSF1 activation , such as CAMK1 , RELB , and PARP3 , consistent with the intimate role of HSF1 in cytoprotection ( Morimoto and Santoro , 1998 ) . STA-9090 slightly upregulates several interferon response-related transcripts , including OAS2 and MX2 ( 2 . 9 and 2 . 2 fold-change , respectively ) , a phenomenon that has been previously reported upon treatment with other Hsp90 inhibitors ( Yang et al . , 2006; Donz\u00e9 et al . , 2001; Shang and Tomasi , 2006 ) . In summary , our RNA-Seq data are fully consistent with the chemically-controlled creation of three unique host cell proteostasis environments in MDCKHSF1 cells . We next serially passaged influenza A/Wuhan/1995 in our three distinctive , small molecule-controlled host environments to test the hypothesis that host proteostasis impacts influenza evolution . Prior to each infection , we split a population of MDCKHSF1 cells and treated with TMP to activate HSF1 , STA-9090 to inhibit Hsp90 , or vehicle ( Figure 3A ) . We infected at a low multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) , ranging from 0 . 001 to 0 . 04 infectious virions/cell , to minimize non-viable variants hitchhiking with functional variants owing to co-infection of a single cell ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . We performed 23 serial passages in biological triplicate in each proteostasis environment . We also performed identical passaging experiments\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0TMP in our MDCKYFP cells to control for any possible off-target effects of TMP treatment or expression of a DHFR-fusion protein in our evolution experiments ( Figure 3B ) . Following each passage , clarified viral supernatant was harvested for hemagglutination titering and subsequent infection to initiate the next passage ( Figure 3C , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Importantly , infectious titering at intermittent passages confirmed that the MOI did not vary systematically between the three distinctive proteostasis environments ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Thus , differences observed in evolutionary trajectories cannot be attributed to either systematically altered rates of viral growth in the three different host proteostasis environments studied here or to gross differences in cell health . Next , we sought to evaluate whether our serial passaging strategy provides a valid platform for modeling influenza evolution . In the absence of a strong exogenous selection pressure , such as an antiviral drug or antibody , we would predict that the influenza genome experiences purifying selection , meaning that most amino acid substitutions result in reduced fitness relative to the wild-type consensus sequence . We assessed the extent of purifying selection by determining the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions at each passage , normalized to the ratio of non-synonymous sites to synonymous sites in the influenza genome ( 3 . 5: 1 ) , defined as Dn/Ds . As expected , non-synonymous mutations are selected against in all folding environments , as indicated by a Dn/Ds\u00a0<\u00a01 throughout our serial passaging ( Figure 3D ) ( Breen et al . , 2012 ) . To comparatively evaluate the selection pressure placed on influenza by our three distinctive host proteostasis environments , we constructed variant frequency distributions ( site frequency spectra; SFS ) for each viral population ( Nielsen , 2005 ) . In the SFS ( Figure 4A\u2013B ) , we separate mutations present above our sequencing error threshold ( 1 . 5% ) in a given viral population into either non-synonymous or synonymous groups . The bars in the SFS charts represent the portion of variants in a viral population that fall within a given frequency bin , averaged across biological triplicates . As expected , the resulting SFS for non-synonymous mutations ( Figure 4A ) show that early passages consist entirely of low frequency variants . As the passaging experiment progresses , the high mutation rate of influenza maintains a substantial population of low frequency variants . However , the proportion of low frequency variants in the viral population decreases as selected mutations increase in frequency and become fixed . This phenomenon is highlighted in later passages as variants begin to occupy high frequency bins and a bimodal , U-shaped distribution emerges . The time resolution afforded by our serial passaging and sequencing strategy provides the opportunity to assess the strength of selection pressure on the influenza genome . Non-synonymous mutations fix latest in the Hsp90-inhibited environment and earliest in the HSF1-activated environment ( Figure 4A; outlined in green ) . For instance , in the Hsp90-inhibited environment , no mutations have exceeded 60% frequency by passage 9 or 80% frequency by passage 11 . In contrast , in the HSF1-activated environment , mutations exceed 80% frequency as early as passage 9 and become fixed ( >90% ) by passage 11 . The basal environment lies between these two extremes , with mutations exceeding only 70% frequency by passage 9 and with no mutations yet being fixed at passage 11 . As mutations in each environment increase in frequency , all the distributions achieve similar U-shaped , bimodal distributions by passage 23 . For the basal and HSF1-activated environments , the distributions become U-shaped by passage 11 , whereas for the Hsp90-inhibited environment , this distribution emerges only after passage 19 . To assess the significance of these differences in the shape of the SFS , we applied the Mann-Whitney test , which is a statistical test for comparing two distributions ( Mann and Whitney , 1947 ) . Indeed , by passage 11 , the first passage at which we observe fixed mutations in any environment , the shape of the non-synonymous SFS for influenza evolved in the Hsp90-inhibited environment is significantly different from that of influenza evolved in the basal and HSF1-activated environments ( Figure 4A ) . This reduced rate of adaptation in Hsp90-inhibited versus basal and HSF1-activated environments is also evident from plotting individual mutation trajectories ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , revealing specific mutations that increase in frequency more gradually when Hsp90 is inhibited . In contrast , the overall shapes of the basal and HSF1-activated SFS are not significantly different . As an internal control , we also examined the SFS and mutation trajectories for synonymous variants ( Figure 4B ) . We find that synonymous mutations for each environment have similar SFS within each passage , and that the Mann-Whitney test cannot distinguish between the synonymous SFS in different proteostasis environments at any stage of the serial passaging experiment ( Figure 4B ) . Moreover , unlike non-synonymous mutations ( see below and also see Figure 4\u2014source data 1 ) , specific synonymous mutations do not fix reproducibly in one particular environment ( Figure 4\u2014source data 2 ) . This observation is consistent with our expectation that , although the influenza genome does undergo selection at the RNA level ( Air et al . , 1990 ) , the host proteostasis-based perturbations of HSF1 activation and Hsp90 inhibition should primarily affect influenza evolution by modulating protein-level folding/function . The similar SFS for synonymous mutations also confirm that differences between folding environments for non-synonymous mutations cannot be attributed to altered viral growth rates . Taken together , these observations draw an intriguing picture of the impact of host proteostasis on viral evolution . On the one hand , there is little effect on strongly deleterious mutations , as illustrated by the similar Dn/Ds ratios across environments ( Figure 3D ) . On the other hand , the rate of adaptation by accumulation of advantageous mutations is significantly reduced in the Hsp90-inhibited environment , as compared to the basal and HSF1-activated environments . This signature of altered selection pressure in distinctive host proteostasis environments highlights the importance of this under-appreciated factor impacting viral evolution . The data in Figure 4 show that the host proteostasis environment is a determinant of the nature of selection pressure placed on the influenza genome . Next , we examined how the mutational landscapes of individual influenza proteins are influenced by these same environments . We anticipated perturbations of HSF1- and Hsp90-mediated proteostasis mechanisms might affect the mutational landscape of polymerase subunits , as their interactions with cytosolic chaperones are well-established ( Momose et al . , 2002; Naito et al . , 2007; Chase et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , our sequencing coverage of the polymerase subunits PA and PB1 was sufficient to rigorously analyze the distribution of mutations in those two genes . We aligned all non-synonymous variants present in passage 23 to the secondary structure , the amino acid relative surface accessibility , and the amino acid conservation score ( or site entropy; Figure 5A\u2013B ) . Using this analysis , we identified regions of PA and PB1 ( outlined in Figure 5A\u2013B ) with a high density of non-synonymous , but not synonymous , mutations with frequencies above our sequencing error threshold ( 1 . 5% ) . We termed these regions mutational hotspots . Most mutational hotspots appear in all host environments , indicating sites under strong positive selection in this experimental setting and/or suggesting inherent mutational tolerance of those protein regions that is independent of host proteostasis . For example , in polymerase PA , residues 590\u2013640 comprise a mutational hotspot present in every host environment ( Figure 5A ) . The region is surface-exposed prior to polymerase complex assembly ( Figure 5A , relative surface accessibility; RSA ) and the mutations largely occur at sites known to be hypervariable ( Figure 5A , site entropy; SE ) ( Pei and Grishin , 2001; Bao et al . , 2008 ) . In contrast , certain other mutational hotspots are specific to or absent from one or more host proteostasis environments . For example , we observe eight mutations in the N-terminal 100 residues of PB1 in the HSF1-activated environment , two mutations in the baseline environment , and only one mutation in the Hsp90-inhibited environment ( Figure 5B ) . The identification of mutational hotspots in the N-terminal domain of PB1 and residues 590\u2013640 of PA is interesting , as their interaction is required for assembly of the mature polymerase complex ( Figure 5C ) ( Reich et al . , 2014; Perez and Donis , 2001; Obayashi et al . , 2008 ) . In particular , residues 9\u201313 of PB1 span the loop portion of a helix-loop-helix motif ( Figure 5B , secondary structure; SS ) that critically defines the interface ( Figure 5C , purple ) with PA ( Figure 5C , red ) ( Reich et al . , 2014; Perez and Donis , 2001; Obayashi et al . , 2008 ) . Our observation that amino acid substitutions in PA at the interface are tolerated in all host environments while substitutions in PB1 at the interface are tolerated only when HSF1 is activated ( Figure 5A\u2013B ) prompted us to further investigate the consequences of these amino acid substitutions . First , we selected mutations that alter amino acid residues known to make direct contacts at the PA\u2013PB1 interface ( Liu and Yao , 2010 ) and that exceed 1 . 5% frequency ( our sequencing error threshold ) for at least two passages ( Figure 5D ) . To estimate their effects on PA:PB1 complex stability , we performed molecular dynamics simulations between wild-type and mutant forms of PAC ( specifically , a C-terminal PA domain covering residues 257\u2013716 ) and PB1N ( an N-terminal PB1 domain spanning the first 15 residues ) ( Liu and Yao , 2010 ) . We observed that the PA variants , which occur in both the HSF1-activated and Hsp90-inhibited environments , have slightly less favorable binding energy with wild-type PB1N ( Figure 5E ) . The PB1 variants , which occur exclusively in the HSF1-activated environment , are also destabilizing , with the K11E substitution very strongly destabilizing the complex ( Figure 5E ) . These data suggest that , whereas our perturbations of host proteostasis may be necessary to accommodate strongly destabilizing mutations in PB1 , they may not be important for moderately destabilizing variants in PA . We note that co-occurrence of certain PA variants ( e . g . , E629K in PA ) can compensate for the strongly destabilizing effects of observed PB1 substitutions ( e . g . , the combination of E629K in PA and K11E in PB1 results in a stable complex; Figure 5\u2014source data 1 ) . However , the mutation frequencies are not strongly correlated in our data and likely occur in distinctive influenza genomes . Cumulatively , these observations indicate that host proteostasis impacts the fitness of destabilizing amino acid substitutions in influenza proteins in a protein-specific manner . Next , we analyzed the mutational trajectories of variants present at high frequency in our founder virus to identify those with significantly altered fitness between proteostasis environments . Such variants had the opportunity to be selected for or against in all environments and thus are less subject to the stochasticity inherent in a serial passaging-based evolution experiment . As we would expect , some non-synonymous variants ( e . g . , HA N262K , NS1 F150S , and PB2 F14S ) follow similar trajectories regardless of host proteostasis ( Figure 4\u2014source data 1 ) . Much more interesting are the HA and PA variants that exhibit divergent trajectories upon serial passaging in distinct folding environments ( Figure 6A\u2013B and Figure 4\u2014source data 1 ) . Notably , we do not observe any synonymous variants with consistently divergent trajectories between environments ( Figure 4\u2014source data 2 ) indicating that the divergent PA and HA trajectories are in fact due to selection at the protein level . In HA , three variants ( N144T , V242I , and M246I ) present at 20% frequency in our founder virus become fixed by passage 19 in all replicates of the HSF1-activated and basal environments , but in only one replicate of the Hsp90-inhibited environment ( Figure 6A ) . Moreover , these variants completely fall out of two replicates of the Hsp90-inhibited environment by passage 9 . All three mutations share identical mutational trajectories and V242I and M246I occur together in sequencing reads . Hence , the trajectory of only one variant , N144T , is shown in Figure 6A . The three mutations occur in the globular head domain of HA that binds cellular sialic acid and has inherently high mutational tolerance ( Thyagarajan and Bloom , 2014 ) . These mutations may increase the affinity of HA for MDCK sialic acid receptors , but may be less fit when Hsp90 is inhibited . HA folding occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum , which contains an Hsp90 isoform ( Grp94 ) that is also inhibited by STA-9090 ( Marzec et al . , 2012 ) . In the absence of active Grp94 , these HA variants may have compromised folding and/or intracellular trafficking , resulting in diminished fitness relative to wild-type HA regardless of any functional advantage they may confer in other host proteostasis environments . In PA , we observed that the H452Q variant is present at 20% frequency in the founder virus and becomes fixed in two replicates of the Hsp90-inhibited environment ( Figure 6B ) . This variant does not become fixed in the basal environment , and is selected against in the HSF1-activated environment . Interestingly , although the H452Q mutation is far from the PA endonuclease site , ( Reich et al . , 2014 ) it is known to occur preferentially in reassorted viruses compared to pure strains , which is indicative of a fitness cost ( Zeldovich et al . , 2015 ) . To unequivocally determine the fitness of the H452Q variant relative to wild-type PA in HSF1-activated and Hsp90-inhibited host cells , we performed reverse genetics to enable head-to-head competition of the variants , thereby quantitatively establishing their relative fitness in our three distinct host proteostasis environments . We prepared wild-type and H452Q PA-containing influenza populations that were otherwise genetically identical . Next , we co-infected host cells displaying HSF1-activated , basal , or Hsp90-inhibited folding environments with equivalent amounts of each virus at low MOI and sequenced the resulting populations after the competition to quantify variant fitness relative to wild-type . We found that Hsp90 inhibition does indeed significantly enhance the fitness of the H452Q variant relative to wild-type PA , while HSF1 activation significantly reduces it ( Figure 6C ) . One likely possibility is that Hsp90 delays subunit assembly or directs destabilized PA variants to degradation , as H452Q has a predicted \u0394\u0394G of\u00a0+1 . 10 kcal/mol relative to wild-type PA ( Yin et al . , 2007 ) . In either scenario , this observation that the fitness of an otherwise deleterious amino acid substitution in a non-autonomous Hsp90 client can be enhanced by chaperone inhibition but reduced by HSF1 activation is provocative . \n Considerable evidence suggests that autonomous chaperone networks can critically influence the evolution of their endogenous client protein partners ( Cowen and Lindquist , 2005; Queitsch et al . , 2002; Lachowiec et al . , 2015; Sangster et al . , 2007 , 2008a , 2008b; Rohner et al . , 2013; Whitesell et al . , 2014; Geiler-Samerotte et al . , 2016; Rutherford and Lindquist , 1998; Tokuriki and Tawfik , 2009b ) . However , prior to this work , the possibility that host chaperones significantly modulate pathogen evolution had not been rigorously investigated . Moreover , in eukaryotic systems , research has focused largely on Hsp90 inhibition . Here , we not only define a new role for host proteostasis in influenza evolution , but we also show that two unique proteostasis perturbations , HSF1 activation and Hsp90 inhibition , have distinctive consequences for client protein evolution . These consequences are revealed at the levels of the whole genome , individual genes , and specific mutations . At the whole\u00a0genome-level , our data indicate that non-synonymous mutations are fixed more slowly when Hsp90 is inhibited and more quickly when HSF1 is activated . Moreover , the overall shape of the Hsp90-inhibited passage 11 SFS is significantly different from that observed in the other two environments . Changes in the rate of adaptation could be caused by buffering of mildly deleterious mutations or by potentiation of advantageous variants ( Cowen and Lindquist , 2005; Queitsch et al . , 2002; Lachowiec et al . , 2015; Sangster et al . , 2007 , 2008a , 2008b; Rohner et al . , 2013; Whitesell et al . , 2014; Geiler-Samerotte et al . , 2016; Rutherford and Lindquist , 1998; Cetinba\u015f and Shakhnovich , 2013 ) . In the case of buffering , the rate of fixation of advantageous variants ( driver mutations ) would be decreased if the effects of mildly deleterious variants linked with the driver ( passenger mutations ) are rendered more damaging by Hsp90 inhibition ( McFarland et al . , 2013 , 2014 ) . In the case of potentiation , Hsp90 activity could necessitate emergence of the observed high frequency variants . Alternatively , Hsp90 activity may reduce weakly deleterious effects of driver mutations on their carrier proteins ( e . g . , disrupted folding caused by an otherwise beneficial mutation ) , thereby increasing the selective advantage provided by the drivers . Though we cannot yet fully resolve which of these factors , or combinations thereof , are at play here , overall , we observe that host proteostasis indeed modulates the pace of influenza evolution . At the level of individual genes , we find that mutational tolerance at the interface of the PA:PB1 influenza polymerase complex , a region essential for polymerase assembly and activity , is impacted by host proteostasis . Interestingly , moderately destabilizing variants in PA are tolerated in all three host proteostasis environments studied . In contrast , amino acid substitutions in the N-terminus of PB1 are observed only when HSF1 is activated . These PB1 variants strongly destabilize the PB1:PA complex and thus may be accessible only in host cells with high chaperone levels . Indeed , polymerase assembly is known to be mediated by cytosolic host chaperones ( Naito et al . , 2007 ) . These observations indicate that the evolution of the influenza polymerase complex may be modulated by host proteostasis in significant ways . At the level of individual mutations , our data demonstrate that host proteostasis impacts the fitness of specific mutations in at least two viral proteins . Intriguingly , the directionality of this effect seems to be specific to a given variant or protein . For example , the apparently destabilizing H452Q PA variant is significantly more fit when Hsp90 is inhibited , but significantly less fit when HSF1 is activated . These results highlight that the impact of proteostasis perturbation on evolution is currently difficult to predict a priori and demands further study , as one might by default assume that chaperone inhibition would enhance the fitness costs of such a mutation . We also identified variants in HA that behave in the opposite manner , displaying apparently enhanced fitness when HSF1 is activated . These divergent effects of host proteostasis on the fitness of individual variants illustrate the complexity of the interactions between viral proteins and host proteostasis mechanisms . Thus , we observe that host proteostasis modulates the nature of selection on the influenza genome , the mutational tolerance of specific influenza proteins , and the trajectories of particular variants . These results are especially compelling because consequences of altered host proteostasis for influenza evolution are emerging in the course of a relatively short-timescale evolution experiment , and without exerting additional selection pressure such as treatment with antiviral drugs . As in previous studies on the role of Hsp90 in the evolution of their endogenous protein clients , our observations may derive from direct interactions between host proteostasis components and influenza proteins , or from indirect consequences of perturbing proteostasis . Untangling these possibilities will require detailed biophysical and mechanistic studies . Regardless of its precise origin , this role for host proteostasis in modulating both the pace and the directionality of influenza evolution is provocative . Our observations raise a number of intriguing questions for future work . How do host proteostasis mechanisms beyond the heat shock response modulate influenza evolution , and what specific chaperones beyond Hsp90 are involved ? Can we quantitatively evaluate the magnitude and ultimately predict the directionality of these effects ? Are these effects direct consequences of host chaperones engaging influenza clients ? If not , what are the mediators ? How does host proteostasis impact the evolution of rapidly evolving viruses beyond just influenza ? Do physiological states involving altered or perturbed proteostasis ( e . g . , fever or host-switching ) impact viral evolution ? Defining the molecular details of this interplay between host proteostasis and viral evolution will be essential to fully elucidate the factors potentiating and constraining viral evolution . Moreover , such studies may eventually enable design of improved antiviral therapeutics and antibodies that are refractory to the evolution of resistance . \n MDCK cells were generously provided by Prof .

The\u00a0rabbit monoclonal anti-HSP90 antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies ( C45G5 ) . MDCKHSF1 cells were seeded at 200 , 000 cells/well in a 6-well plate and treated with 0 . 01% DMSO , 10 \u03bcM TMP , or 10 and 25 nM STA-9090 for 48 hr prior to harvesting cell lysates . 100 \u03bcg of protein lysate was separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE polyacrylamide gel , followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane . Hsp70 , Hsp40 , Hsp90 , and actin protein levels were determined using the antibodies described above . Membranes were incubated with 680 or 800 nm fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies ( LI-COR Biosciences , Lincoln , NE ) prior to detection using a LI-COR Biosciences Odyssey Imager . Band intensity quantification was performed using Image J . MDCKHSF1 cells were seeded at 100 , 000 cells/well in a 12-well plate and treated with 0 . 01% DMSO , 10 \u03bcM TMP , or 10 nM STA-9090 for 24 hr . MDCKYFP cells were treated with 0 . 01% DMSO or 10 \u03bcM TMP for 24 hr , or 100 \u03bcM arsenite for 2 hr as a positive control for heat shock response activation . To monitor chaperone levels during influenza infection , MDCKHSF1 cells were infected with influenza A/Wuhan/1995 at an MOI of 1 for 8 hr to properly mimic the actual environment of a cell infected with a single influenza virion as in our serial passaging experiment . Cellular RNA was harvested using the Omega RNA Extraction kit with Homogenizer Columns . 1 \u03bcg RNA was used to prepare cDNA using random primers ( total reaction volume\u00a0=\u00a020 \u03bcL; Applied Biosystems High-Capacity Reverse Transcription kit ) . The reverse transcription reaction was diluted to 80 \u03bcL with water , and 2 \u03bcL of each sample was used for qPCR with 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Sybr Green ( Roche ) and primers for canis RPLP2 ( housekeeping gene ) , Hsp70 , Hsp40 , Hsp90 , and influenza Matrix ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Hsp transcript levels were normalized to RPLP2 . For qPCR of influenza-infected cells , a standard curve was prepared with a pDZ plasmid backbone containing the Influenza PR8 M segment to determine influenza Matrix copy number , which was used as a positive control for productive infection . For the MDCKHSF1 cell line characterization ( Figure 2 ) , MDCKHSF1 cells were seeded at 100 , 000 cells/well in a 12-well plate and treated with 0 . 01% DMSO , 10 \u03bcM TMP , or 10 nM STA-9090 for 24 hr . MDCKYFP cells were treated with 0 . 01% DMSO or 10 \u03bcM TMP . Each treatment was done in biological triplicate . Cellular RNA was harvested using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kit with QIAshredder homogenization columns . RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina NeoPrep system and were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq SE40 . Quality control: Reads were aligned against canFam3 ( Sept . 2011 ) using bwa mem v . 0 . 7 . 12-r1039\u00a0[RRID:SCR_010910] with flags \u2013t 16 \u2013f . Mapping rates , fraction of multiply-mapping reads , number of unique 20-mers at the 5\u2019 end of the reads , insert size distributions and fraction of ribosomal RNAs were calculated using dedicated perl scripts and bedtools v . 2 . 25 . 0\u00a0[RRID:SCR_006646] ( Quinlan and Hall , 2010;\u00a0Huang et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , each resulting bam file was randomly down-sampled to a million reads , which were aligned against canFam3 and read density across genomic features were estimated for RNA-Seq-specific quality control metrics ( Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . RNA-Seq mapping and quantitation: Reads were aligned against canFam3/ENSEMBL 86 ( Aken et al . , 2017 ) annotation using STAR v . 2 . 5 . 3a with the following flags -runThreadN 8 --runMode alignReads --outFilterType BySJout --outFilterMultimapNmax 20 --alignSJoverhangMin 8 --alignSJDBoverhangMin 1 --outFilterMismatchNmax 999 --alignIntronMin 10 --alignIntronMax 1000000 --alignMatesGapMax 1000000 --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate --quantMode TranscriptomeSAM with --genomeDir pointing to a 75nt-junction canFam3 STAR suffix array ( Dobin et al . , 2013 ) . Gene expression was quantitated using RSEM v . 1 . 3 . 0 [RRID:SCR_013027]\u00a0with the following flags for all libraries: rsem-calculate-expression --calc-pme --alignments -p 8 --forward-prob 0 against an annotation matching the STAR SA reference ( Li and Dewey , 2011 ) . Posterior mean estimates ( pme ) of counts and estimated RPKM were retrieved . Differential expression analysis: Treatments were compared against DMSO for MDCKHSF1 and MDCKYFP cell lines independently . Briefly , differential expression analysis\u00a0was performed in the R statistical environment ( R v . 3 . 2 . 3 ) using Bioconductor\u2019s DESeq 2 package on the protein-coding genes only [RRID:SCR_000154] ( Love et al . , 2014 ) . Dataset parameters were estimated using the estimateSizeFactors ( ) , and estimateDispersions ( ) functions; read counts across conditions were modeled based on a negative binomial distribution and a Wald test was used to test for differential expression ( nbinomWaldtest ( ) , all packaged into the DESeq ( ) function ) , using the treatment type as a contrast . Fold-changes , p-values and Benjamin-Hochberg-adjusted p-values ( BH ) were reported for each protein-coding gene ( Figure 2\u2014source data 2 ) . Transcripts changing\u00a0\u22652 fold with a p-value<10\u20135 are included in Figure 2\u2014source data 3 . For the annotation of these transcripts , the reference gene annotation was canFam3/ENSEMBL 86\u00a0[RRID:SCR_002344] . Canine genes lacking an official gene symbol were manually annotated by individual inspection of the orthology tracks in the UCSC genome browser and reviewing the orthology and paralogy evidence in the ENSEMBL database ( release 89 ) . Presumed genes/gene families were assigned based on the depth of gene model conservation across species and orthologs and paralogs assigned by ENSEMBL . If transcripts not identified in the reference annotation displayed very strong homology across multiple species , transcripts were annotated with a single asterisk \u2018*' or termed \u2018gene , by homology\u2019 in Figure 2B and Figure 2\u2014source data 3 , respectively . Alternatively , if transcripts not identified in the reference annotation fell within paralog gene families with partial homology they were annotated with a double asterisk \u2018**' or termed \u2018gene-like\u2019 in Figure 2B and Figure 2\u2014source data 3 , respectively . For each biological replicate , MDCKHSF1 cells were seeded at 3 , 000 , 000 cells/plate in 15 cm plates and treated with 0 . 01% DMSO or 10 nM STA-9090 for 4 hr . After drug treatment , cells were harvested by trypsinizing , washed twice with PBS , and resuspended in PBS ( with DMSO or STA-9090 ) at a concentration of 20 , 000 , 000 cells/mL . This cell suspension was heated in a thermocycler at a temperature gradient ( 100 \u03bcL per temperature per treatment condition ) for 3 min , followed by 3 min at room temperature ( Martinez Molina et al . , 2013 ) . Samples were then lysed in a modified RIPA buffer without SDS . Lysate was then separated by centrifugation and run ( in technical triplicate ) on an SDS-PAGE gel in reducing loading buffer . Protein\u00a0bands\u00a0were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane , which was probed with an Hsp90 primary antibody ( C45G5 ) . Membranes were incubated with 800 nm fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies ( LI-COR Biosciences ) prior to detection using a LI-COR Biosciences Odyssey Imager . Band intensity quantification was performed using Image J , and the\u00a0signal\u00a0was normalized to the band intensity at 37\u00b0C . Technical replicates were averaged within each biological replicate; biological triplicates were then averaged , with the SEM propagated . Serial passaging experiments were performed on a 12-well scale in biological triplicate , at 100 , 000 cells/well and an MOI of 0 . 002 virions/cell , as estimated\u00a0by hemagglutination\u00a0titering . Cells were pre-treated with TMP or DMSO for 24 hr or with STA-9090 for 90 min prior to influenza infection to establish altered proteostasis environments . All infections were performed in DMEM supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin , glutamine , 1 \u03bcg/mL TPCK-trypsin , and the relevant small molecules for modulating proteostasis capacity . Infections were allowed to proceed for 48 hr , after which the viral supernatant was harvested , cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation , and titered using a hemagglutination assay ( Eisfeld et al . , 2014 ) . Viral supernatant was diluted 2-fold across round-bottom 96-well plates with PBS and incubated with human red blood cells ( 3 . 92\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 RBC/mL; Innovative Research ) for 30\u2013120 min . Wells displaying agglutination were marked influenza-positive , and the titer was determined based on the lowest dilution that was still influenza-positive . Influenza was serially passaged in both the MDCKHSF1 and MDCKYFP cell lines in biological triplicate for each treatment condition ( 0 . 01% DMSO , 10 \u03bcM TMP , and 10 nM STA-9090 ) for 23 passages . Titering was performed in technical duplicate for each biological replicate , with minimal variation observed between technical replicates . We employed a TCID50 assay based on that described by Thyagarajan and Bloom ( Thyagarajan and Bloom , 2014 ) . Briefly , eight 10-fold dilutions of each virus were prepared in quadruplicate in 96-well plates . 5 , 000 MDCKHSF1 cells were then added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 hr , after which the wells were scored for the presence of cytopathic effect . The dilutions of virus displaying cytopathic effect in the MDCKHSF1 cells were then used to calculate the TCID50/\u03bcL using https://github . com/jbloomlab/reedmuenchcalculator as described by Thyagarajan and Bloom , ( Thyagarajan and Bloom , 2014 ) where virions/\u03bcL\u00a0=\u00a00 . 69*TCID50/\u03bcL . The H452Q PA variant was introduced by site directed mutagenesis on a wild-type PA pHW2000 reverse genetics plasmid for the influenza A/Wuhan/1995 H3N2 strain ( generous gift from Prof . Hui-Ling Yen at Hong Kong University ) ( Cheung et al . , 2014 ) . The corresponding mutant and wild-type viruses were made by co-transfection on a co-culture of MDCK and HEK 293T cells , previously described by Hoffman et al ( Hoffmann et al . , 2000 ) . Viruses were titered using a TCID50 assay ( Thyagarajan and Bloom , 2014 ) to perform competition experiments starting with approximately the same amount of wild-type and mutant virus . Competitions were performed under conditions identical to that of the serial passaging experiments , in biological triplicate . RNA from the P0 and P1 viral supernatant was harvested and prepared for sequencing , as described below . RNA was extracted from 140 \u03bcL influenza supernatant from passages P0 , P2 , P9 , P11 , P19 and P23 using the Qiagen RNA Mini Kit and eluted in 40 \u03bcL molecular biology grade H2O . dsDNA was made from 2 . 5 \u03bcL template RNA using universal influenza primers as previously described , ( Zhou et al . , 2009 ) except that the small segments were amplified separately from the polymerase segments and pooled following PCR . The amplicons were separated on a 0 . 8% agarose analytical gel to verify the presence of each influenza genomic segment ( 8 total ) . 1 ng of each sample was prepared using the Illumina NexteraXT Sample Preparation kit , omitting the bead normalization step . The concentration of dsDNA in each sample was quantified by Qubit; samples were pooled in sets of 24 and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq 300v2 cartridge to obtain 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150 base pair paired-end reads . RNA from the reverse genetics competition experiments was sequenced using the same protocol , except primers that specifically amplified\u00a0~900 bp of the PA gene spanning the mutation site were used for PCR ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Sequencing reads were aligned against the influenza\u00a0A/Wuhan/1995 complete CDS sequence , or the influenza\u00a0A/Wuhan/1995 PA sequence ( for reverse genetics sequencing ) , using bwa mem 0 . 7 . 10-r789\u00a0[RRID:SCR_010910] . Allele pileups were generated using samtools v . 0 . 1 . 19 mpileup\u00a0[RRID:SCR_002105] with flags -d 10000000 --excl-flags 2052 , and allele counts/frequencies were extracted ( Li , 2011; Li et al . , 2009 ) . Only positions with greater than 600-fold coverage in all replicates of each sample were included in the analysis . Variant alleles present at greater than 1 . 5% frequency are included in the site frequency spectra ( Figure 4 ) , protein alignment ( Figure 5 ) , and mutational trajectories ( Figure 6 ) analyses . This frequency threshold is the lowest mutation frequency at which a mutation can be reliably detected in a sample that is sequenced in technical duplicate , for our specific sequencing method and instrument . A 600-fold coverage threshold requires that we observe such a mutation a minimum of nine times . All trajectories for mutations that increase in frequency during passaging are included in Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 . Increasing trajectories are those best fitting an increasing exponential model\u00a0aebx , where a\u00a0>\u00a00 and b\u00a0>\u00a00 . 1 . Best fit was determined by comparing least squares regression value . Selected mutations with divergent trajectories between environments are plotted in Figure 6 . Site frequency spectra were generated by binning all mutations meeting our coverage ( 600-fold ) and frequency ( >1 . 5% ) thresholds into 10% frequency bins and averaging the portion of mutations within a given frequency bin across biological triplicates . To quantify differences in the passage 11 site frequency spectra , the Mann-Whitney test was performed using Graph Pad Prism software ( details in statistics section below ) . Alignment analyses were performed by aligning mutations meeting our coverage and frequency thresholds to the corresponding secondary structure and relative surface accessibility using DSSP , ( Kabsch and Sander , 1983; Joosten et al . , 2011; Bloom , 2014 ) as well as to the site entropy , which was computed using all full-length protein sequences from the Influenza Virus Resource for all Influenza A PA and PB1 sequences except bat influenza sequences ( Pei and Grishin , 2001; Bao et al . , 2008; Katoh and Standley , 2013 ) . Observed mutations were also mapped onto the corresponding protein crystal structure ( PA-PB1 PBDID 4WSB ) ( Reich et al . , 2014 ) . Mutational hotspots were manually determined as regions with a high density of exclusively non-synonymous mutations . Sequencing reads from reverse genetics competition experiments were aligned to the PA reference sequence to determine %-frequency of mutant and wild-type alleles . The ratio of mutant to wild-type PA was calculated for each replicate of each proteostasis environment; the resulting ratio was normalized to the average ratio of mutant to wild-type PA in the basal proteostasis environment . Ratios were then averaged for each set of biological replicates and plotted as a bar chart with SEM . An unpaired t-test was used to assess statistical significance between host environments . Mutant protein stability predictions were made using Eris , ( Yin et al . , 2007 ) employing the fixed backbone setting . All experiments were performed in at least biological triplicate , which we define as replicates that are independent for the entirety of the experiment ( i . e . , from plating the cells , to treating the cells , to acquiring the data ) . To quantify differences in the passage 11 site frequency spectra ( Figure 4 ) , the Mann-Whitney test was performed using Graph Pad Prism software ( nonparametric , one-tailed ) . This test was performed on the passage 11 site frequency spectra because this is the first passage at which we observe fixed mutations in any environment . A one-tailed test was used as we expect mutation frequency spectra to shift in a one-directional manner as mutations become fixed and the distribution becomes U-shaped . All mutation frequencies observed in the two distributions ( where each distribution represents three biological triplicate data sets ) to be compared were ranked . Each set of ranks was then compared to determine if the distributions are significantly different . The Mann-Whitney ( Mann and Whitney , 1947 ) U values were: 2109 ( HSF1 ( N\u00a0=\u00a073; median\u00a0=\u00a04 . 92 ) vs . Hsp90-inhibited ( N\u00a0=\u00a071; median\u00a0=\u00a03 . 472 ) non-synonymous ) , 661 ( HSF1 ( N\u00a0=\u00a041; median\u00a0=\u00a04 . 01 ) vs . Hsp90-inhibited ( N\u00a0=\u00a034; median\u00a0=\u00a03 . 212 ) synonymous ) , 2340 ( basal ( N\u00a0=\u00a079; median\u00a0=\u00a04 . 787 ) vs . Hsp90-inhibited ( N\u00a0=\u00a071; median\u00a0=\u00a03 . 472 ) non-synonymous ) , 776 ( basal ( N\u00a0=\u00a048; median\u00a0=\u00a03 . 934 ) vs . Hsp90-inhibited ( N\u00a0=\u00a034; median\u00a0=\u00a03 . 212 ) synonymous ) , 2819 ( HSF1 ( N\u00a0=\u00a073; median\u00a0=\u00a04 . 92 ) vs . basal ( N\u00a0=\u00a079; median\u00a0=\u00a04 . 787 ) non-synonymous ) , 970 ( HSF1 ( N\u00a0=\u00a041; median\u00a0=\u00a04 . 01 ) vs . basal ( N\u00a0=\u00a048; median\u00a0=\u00a03 . 934 ) synonymous ) . To assess statistical significance for the reverse genetics competition experiment ( Figure 6C ) , an unpaired t-test was performed between each set of conditions , each with three biological replicate data sets ( basal vs . HSF1: p-value\u00a0=0 . 0019; t\u00a0=\u00a04 . 192; df\u00a0=\u00a010; basal vs . Hsp90-inhibited: p-value\u00a0=0 . 0091; t\u00a0=\u00a03 . 224; df\u00a0=\u00a010; HSF1 vs . Hsp90-inhibited: p-value\u00a0<0 . 0001; t\u00a0=\u00a012 . 45; df\u00a0=\u00a010 ) . To assess statistical significance for the CETSA ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D ) , the vehicle and STA-9090 conditions were compared across biological triplicates ( technical triplicates for each biological triplicate ) by an F-test ( p-value\u00a0<0 . 0001 , F ( DFn , DFd ) =16 . 48 ( 1 , 194 ) ) . The wild type PAC\u2013PB1N complex was taken from the crystal structure with PDBID 2ZNL ( Obayashi et al . , 2008 ) . PAC is the C-terminal PA domain ( residues 257\u2013716 ) , and PB1N is the N-terminal domain ( residues 1\u201315 ) of PB1 . In 2ZNL there are some missing residues ( residues 349\u2013353; 372\u2013397; 550\u2013557 ) , but they were distant from the PAC\u2013PB1N binding site . As all of these missing residues were far from the binding site they were not added back in . Furthermore , as described below , only residues 398\u2013716 of PAC were allowed to move and the rest of PAC was position-restrained throughout the simulations . For each segment of PAC , the termini were far away from the interaction site and thus were left uncapped . The N-terminus of PB1N was also left uncapped; however , the C-terminus of the short 15-residue PB1N was capped with an N-methyl group to remove the artificial negative charge . All mutations of the wild-type complex were made using the Pymol molecular modeling package ( DeLano , 2002 ) . All MD simulations were performed using the GROMACS 4 . 6 . 7 suite ( Hess et al . , 2008 ) . All simulations were performed using the AMBER99 force field ( Hornak et al . , 2006 ) and TIP3P ( Jorgensen et al . , 1983 ) water . Each initial complex structure ( wild-type and mutant subunits ) was first immersed in a cubic box containing pre-equilibrated water molecules . The dimensions of the water box were 102 \u00c5\u00a0\u00d7109 \u00c5 \u00d7 79 \u00c5 . Counter-ions were added as necessary to neutralize the system . The solvated system was then energy-minimized using the steepest descent algorithm for a maximum of 5000 iterations with a force constant of 1000 kJ mol\u20131 nm\u20132 applied to all non-hydrogen atoms . Next , a further energy minimization was performed without any constraints where the steepest descent method switched to conjugate gradient every 500 steps for a maximum of 2500 total steps . The system then underwent a two-stage equilibration process . The first stage of equilibration was a 100 ps NVT ( isochoric\u2013isothermal ) simulation and consisted of a gentle annealing of the system from 0 to 300 K over the first 50 ps . Throughout the first stage of equilibration , a position restraint was applied to all non-hydrogen atoms with a force constant of 1000 kJ mol\u20131 nm\u20132 . The temperature was maintained at 300 K using the V-rescale thermostat ( Bussi et al . , 2007 ) with a coupling time constant of 1 . 0 ps . The complex and solvent molecules were coupled to separate thermostats to avoid the \u2018hot solvent-cold solute\u2019 problem ( Cheng and Merz , 1996; Lingenheil et al . , 2008 ) . The second stage of equilibration was a 500 ps NPT ( isobaric\u2013isothermal ) simulation where position restraints were applied to all non-hydrogen atoms of residues 257\u2013348 and 354\u2013371 of PAC , as these residues are far from the PAC\u2013PB1N interaction site . The pressure was regulated using the Berendsen barostat ( Berendsen et al . , 1984 ) with a reference pressure of 1 bar and a pressure coupling constant of 2 . 0 ps . The leapfrog algorithm ( Hockney , 1970 ) with a time step of 2 fs was used for dynamics evolution . All bonds\u00a0involving\u00a0hydrogen were constrained using the LINCS algorithm ( Hess et al . , 1997 ) . All neighbor searching , electrostatic interactions and van der Waals interactions were truncated at 1 . 4 nm . Long-range Coulomb interactions were treated using the particle mesh Ewald ( PME ) summation ( Essmann et al . , 1995 ) with a Fourier spacing of 0 . 12 nm and a PME order of 4 . A long-range dispersion correction for energy and pressure was applied to account for the 1 . 4 nm cut-off of Lennard-Jones interactions ( Allen and Tildesley , 1987 ) . All production runs followed the same scheme as the second equilibration stage and were run for 20 ns total . Binding free energy calculations were performed on the last 10 ns of each production simulation . The last 10 ns of each simulation were stripped of water molecules and counter ions . From these , snapshots were extracted every 10 ps giving 1000 snapshots for the last 10 ns . The binding free energy was calculated as described by Liu\u00a0and\u00a0Yao ( Liu and Yao , 2010 ) . Here , the binding free energy was calculated as Htotal , GB = Egas + Gsol , GB , and thus did not contain any contribution from solute configuration entropy . Since our focus here is on the relative order of binding affinities and the complexes have similar binding poses , the solute configuration entropy is thus omitted ( Rastelli et al . , 2010; Hou et al . , 2011a , 2011b; Wang et al . , 2001 ) . The GBSA implicit solvent model ( Still et al . , 1990 ) was used with a dielectric constant of 80 . The OBC ( II ) ( Onufriev et al . , 2004 ) algorithm was used to calculate the Born radii with a frequency of 1 and a cutoff of 1 . 4 nm . A surface tension of 3 . 01248 kJ mol\u20131 nm\u20132 was set using the Ace-approximation . Averages and standard error of mean were calculated based on 200 snapshot increments ."}

Much like an electrical wire , the nerve fiber or axon is coated by a multiple-layered insulation , called the myelin sheath . However , unlike electrical insulation , the myelin sheath is regularly interrupted to expose short regions of the underlying nerve . These exposed regions and the adjacent regions underneath the myelin contain ion channels that help to propagate electrical signals along the axon . Peroxisomes are compartments in animal cells that process fats . Genetic mutations that prevent peroxisomes from working properly can lead to diseases where the nerves cannot transmit signals correctly . This is thought to be because the nerves lose their myelin sheath , which largely consists of fatty molecules . The nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord are known as peripheral nerves . Kleinecke et al . have now analyzed peripheral nerves from mice that had one of three different genetic mutations , preventing their peroxisomes from working correctly . Even in cases where the mutation severely impaired nerve signaling , the peripheral nerves retained their myelin sheath . The peroxisome mutations did affect a particular type of potassium ion channel and the anchor proteins that hold these channels in place . The role of these potassium ion channels is not fully known , but normally they are only found close to regions of the axon that are not coated by myelin . However , the peroxisome mutations meant that the channels and their protein anchors were now also located along the myelinated segments of the nerve\u2019s axons . This redistribution of the potassium ion channels likely contributes to the peripheral nerves being unable to signal properly . In addition , Kleinecke et al . found that disrupting the peroxisomes also affected another cell compartment , called the lysosome , in the nerve cells that insulate axons with myelin sheaths . Lysosomes help to break down unwanted fat molecules . Mutant mice had more lysosomes than normal , but these lysosomes did not work efficiently . This caused the nerve cells to store more of certain types of molecules , including molecules called glycolipids that stabilize protein anchors , which hold the potassium channels in place . A likely result is that protein anchors that would normally be degraded are not , leading to the potassium channels appearing inappropriately throughout the nerve . Future work is now needed to investigate whether peroxisomal diseases cause similar changes in the brain . The results presented by Kleinecke et al . also suggest that targeting the lysosomes or the potassium channels could present new ways to treat disorders of the peroxisomes .", "source": "Impairment of peripheral nerve function is frequent in neurometabolic diseases , but mechanistically not well understood . Here , we report a novel disease mechanism and the finding that glial lipid metabolism is critical for axon function , independent of myelin itself . Surprisingly , nerves of Schwann cell-specific Pex5 mutant mice were unaltered regarding axon numbers , axonal calibers , and myelin sheath thickness by electron microscopy . In search for a molecular mechanism , we revealed enhanced abundance and internodal expression of axonal membrane proteins normally restricted to juxtaparanodal lipid-rafts . Gangliosides were altered and enriched within an expanded lysosomal compartment of paranodal loops . We revealed the same pathological features in a mouse model of human Adrenomyeloneuropathy , preceding disease-onset by one year . Thus , peroxisomal dysfunction causes secondary failure of local lysosomes , thereby impairing the turnover of gangliosides in myelin . This reveals a new aspect of axon-glia interactions , with Schwann cell lipid metabolism regulating the anchorage of juxtaparanodal Kv1-channels . \n Schwann cells , the myelinating cells of the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) , contain peroxisomes in distant cytoplasmic compartments , including myelin channels and cytosolic loop regions close to nodes of Ranvier ( Kassmann et al . , 2011 ) . Peroxisomes degrade fatty acids derived from myelin lipids and generate precursors of myelin plasmalogens ( Waterham et al . , 2016 ) . Lysosomal compartments are\u00a0also present in these nodal regions ( Gatzinsky et al . , 1997 ) , and growing evidence from in vitro studies suggests interactions between both types of organelles ( Baarine et al . , 2012; Chu et al . , 2015; Thai et al . , 2001 ) . Peroxisomal dysfunction is caused by mutations of genes encoding peroxisomal proteins or peroxisomal biogenesis factors ( Waterham et al . , 2016 ) . In humans , loss-of-function mutations of ABCD1 are responsible for the disease X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy ( X-ALD ) . This peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette ( ABC- ) transporter mediates the import of very long-chain fatty acids ( VLCFA ) into the organelle . In consequence , ABCD1-deficient peroxisomes are not capable of importing and degrading VLCFA that are specific substrates of peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation ( Kemp et al . , 2012 ) . A more severe impairment of peroxisomes is caused by lack of the Hsd17b4 gene ( also called multifunctional protein 2; Mfp2 gene ) that encodes\u00a0a central enzyme of peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation . In MFP2-deficient cells , the \u03b2-oxidation of virtually all peroxisome-specific substrates , including VLCFA , is inhibited ( Verheijden et al . , 2013 ) . A complete disruption of the organelle is observed in the absence of peroxisome biogenesis factor peroxin 5 ( PEX5 ) . This cycling receptor recognizes proteins with a peroxisomal targeting sequence type 1 ( PTS1 ) and is involved in their transfer into peroxisomes . PEX5-dependent protein import applies to the majority of peroxisomal enzymes . Thus , PEX5-deletion disrupts peroxisomal function substantially ( Waterham et al . , 2016 ) . Schwann cell lipid metabolism is rate-limiting for myelination and is important for maintenance of axonal integrity ( Saher et al . , 2011; Viader et al . , 2013 ) , which requires in addition to membrane wrapping the assembly of nodal , paranodal , and juxtaparanodal membrane proteins ( Rasband and Peles , 2015 ) . The juxtaparanodal domain of myelinated axons harbors voltage-gated shaker-type potassium channels , Kv1 . 1 ( KCNA1 ) and Kv1 . 2 ( KCNA2; Chiu and Ritchie , 1980; Robbins and Tempel , 2012 ) , which also align the inner mesaxon as a thin band ( Arroyo et al . , 1999 ) . Associated with connexin-29 hemichannels ( Rash et al . , 2016 ) , their clustering and anchoring at juxtaparanodes requires the neuronal membrane proteins CASPR2 and TAG-1 , the latter expressed by glia and neurons ( Poliak et al . , 1999b; Traka et al . , 2003 ) . Kv1 channels have been proposed to play a role in regulating fiber excitability ( Baker et al . , 2011; Glasscock et al . , 2012 ) , but the exact in vivo function of these fast-opening/slowly\u00a0inactivating channels remains unknown ( Arancibia-Carcamo and Attwell , 2014 ) . \n Cnp-Cre::Pex5flox/flox mice , termed cKO or 'mutants' in the following , lack peroxisomal protein import in Schwann cells ( Figure 1a; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a ) . The PNS of these mice is well myelinated and unlike the CNS ( Kassmann et al . , 2007 ) without immune-mediated injury , in agreement with pilot observations ( Kassmann et al . , 2011 ) . Upon closer inspection , we determined about 50% genomic recombination , corresponding to the fraction of Schwann\u00a0cell ( SC ) nuclei in sciatic nerves ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1b ) . Teased fiber preparations , stained for PMP70 , revealed peroxisomes as puncta . In mutant nerves , these were import-deficient 'ghosts' , as evidenced by cytoplasmic catalase , normally a luminal peroxisomal marker ( Figure 1b ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 23332 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 23332 . 007 Peroxisomal dysfunction in myelinating SC was confirmed by lipid mass spectrometry ( Figure 1c , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1c ) , showing reduced plasmalogens ( PEP- ) and its precursor alkylated phosphatidyl-ethanolamines ( PEO-;\u00a0Wanders , 2014 ) . Also VLCFA were increased , indicating the accumulation of peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation substrates ( Figure 1d; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1d ) . We determined nerve conduction velocity ( NCV ) by electrophysiology of isolated sciatic nerves ( to avoid possible contributions of altered muscle endplates ) at the\u00a0age of\u00a02 months ( Figure 1e\u2013g; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2a ) . For all stimulus intensities tested , responses of mutant nerves were different from controls ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2b ) . Compound action potentials ( CAPs ) and NCV were diminished in mutants ( mean: 28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 . 7 m/s ) compared to controls ( 41 . 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 . 6 m/s; Figure 1e ) . Thresholds to evoke a signal were only slightly elevated ( 155\u00b5A versus 135\u00b5A ) , but the maximal response was 50% of control ( Figure 1f , g ) . Also , in vivo recordings revealed significantly reduced compound muscle action potentials ( CMAPs ) in mutant mice ( Kassmann et al . , 2011 ) . This was more enhanced when stimulating proximally than distally , which clinically defines conduction blocks ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2c ) . We suspected that reduced nerve conduction would be explained by demyelination . Surprisingly , by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis structural myelin proteins , including PMP22 , MPZ/P0 , and P2 , were not significantly altered ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3a , b ) . Only PLP , a minor PNS myelin protein , showed significant reduction . Also by electron microscopy ( EM ) , myelin thickness , periodicity , and compaction were indistinguishable ( Figure 1h , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3c ) . Next , we determined internodal length in teased fiber preparations , which was shorter in mutant ( 623 nm ) than in control fibers ( 691 nm; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3d ) , but unlikely sufficiently reduced to cause a slower conduction by itself ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) . Importantly , while the reduced CAP suggested significant axon loss at 2 months , the morphometric analysis of entire nerve cross-sections revealed normal axonal numbers and calibers ( Figure 1i ) . Thus , reduced CAPs were most likely caused by functional conduction blocks rather than physical axon loss . Signs of axonal transport defects ( APP accumulations ) were not observed ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3e ) , and also , indirect signs of neurodegeneration ( neuroinflammation ) were not significantly enhanced in nerves at 2 months ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4a\u2013d ) . Disruptions of axo-glial junctions might cause leak currents and thus conduction failure ( Arancibia-Carcamo and Attwell , 2014 ) . Yet , both neurofascin-155 ( NF155 ) and axonal CASPR , that\u00a0is adhesion proteins that mediate axo-glial contacts ( Desmazieres et al . , 2014; Normand and Rasband , 2015 ) , were normally localized ( Figure 1j ) . By EM , we never found the detachment of paranodal loops ( Figure 1k , l ) , even where abnormally enlarged by accumulated vesicles ( Kassmann et al . , 2011 ) . Next , we examined the distribution of ion channels ( Devaux et al . , 2004; Rasband and Peles , 2015 ) in sciatic nerve teased fibers from 2- and 9-month-old mutants and controls . Nodal Nav1 . 6 and Kv7 . 2 , as well as their anchoring proteins , were normally flanked by CASPR-positive paranodes ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013c ) . Surprisingly , the juxtaparanodal potassium channel protein Kv1 . 1 displayed an abnormal localization , frequently displaced into the adjacent internodal region , and to a minor extent into paranodes . Kv1 . 1 clusters were in the majority of cases still maintained at juxtaparanodes , suggesting that internodal mislocalization is secondary ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1d , e; Figure 2a ) . Indeed , the pathology of internodal Kv1 channels progressively increased with age frequently presenting more than one extra cluster along one internode in aged mutants , while shifts into the nodal direction were not progressive ( Figure 2a , b; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1e ) . We confirmed the observation of displaced juxtaparanodal Kv1 channels using Kv1 . 2 antibody ( data not shown ) . At 9 months , we determined a twofold overall increase of Kv1 . 1 in nerve lysates ( Figure 2c , d ) . However , as most Kv1 . 1 is expressed by unmyelinated fibers , the increase of internodal Kv1 . 1 in myelinated axons may be significantly higher . Neuronal CASPR2 , the cis-anchor for Kv1 channels in the axonal membrane , and TAG-1 on SC are essential for channel clustering at juxtaparanodes ( Hivert et al . , 2016; Poliak et al . , 1999a; Savvaki et al . , 2010 ) . Both proteins colocalized with Kv1 . 1 at regular and ectopic internodal positions ( Figure 2e\u2013g ) . TAG-1 expression was slightly but not significantly elevated ( Figure 2h ) . In contrast , staining for myelin-associated glycoprotein ( MAG ) did not reveal a connection between Schmidt-Lanterman incisures and the ectopic Kv1 . 1/TAG-1/CASPR2-positive clusters ( data not shown ) . Although , we cannot exclude that enhanced expression of TAG-1 contributes to the formation of ectopic protein clusters , the observations suggest that in mutant nerves entire membrane patches of the juxtaparanodal compartment accumulate , break-off , and drift into the internodal region . 10 . 7554/eLife . 23332 . 008Figure 2 .

Only mutant nerves show extra Kv1 . 1+ patches within internodes .

We analyzed sciatic nerve lysates from 9-month-old mutants by lipid mass spectrometry and noted that many more gangliosides contained VLCFA ( a 14-fold enrichment; Figure 2h ) . To determine their subcellular distribution , we stained teased fibers with a fluorescently tagged cholera-toxin subunit B ( CTB ) , which binds GM1 gangliosides . Also by immunostaining , GM1 was restricted to paranodes in wild-type nerves but widely dispersed into the internodal myelin of mutant nerves ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2; Figure 2i ) . Likewise , ganglioside GD1a could be immunostained as enlarged puncta ( >5 \u00b5m ) in internodal myelin of mutant nerves ( Figure 3a ) . These GD1a-containing vesicles that colocalized with LAMP1 were a frequent finding in mutant internodes , but rarely observed in controls ( Figure 3a , left ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 23332 . 011Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 23332 . 013 Paranodal loops in conditional mutants showed vesicular inclusions of variable size and electron-density ( Figure 3b ) . By immune-labeling of ultra-thin cryosections and teased fibers , the majority of these were LAMP1-positive ( Figure 3c , d; Figure 3\u2014source data 1 ) . Even more striking , lysosomal LIMP-2 marked small puncta in controls ( <500 nm ) , but giant compartments within mutant paranodes ( Figure 3e , right ) . Strongly increased abundance of LAMP1 and LIMP-2 was confirmed by Western blotting ( Figure 3f , g ) . Decreased mRNA levels ( Figure 3h ) suggest that the enrichment of LAMP1 and LIMP-2 marks organelle accumulation rather than enhanced lysosomal biogenesis . Lysosomal markers are found in autophagosomes and early/late endosomes ( Saftig and Klumperman , 2009 ) . We thus phenotyped accumulated vesicles with antibodies specific for EEA1 , RAB7 , and ATG5 . Neither marker was increased at mutant paranodes ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013c ) . Therefore , the majority of accumulating vesicles within mutant paranodes are likely bona fide lysosomes , serving the degradation of myelin-associated proteins/lipids , including gangliosides ( Luzio et al . , 2007; Saftig and Klumperman , 2009 ) . To determine the relationship between paranodal lysosomes ( Gatzinsky et al . , 1997 ) and peroxisomes , we immunostained for PMP70 and LAMP1 , revealing a close spatial association ( Figure 3i ) as reported for cultured cells ( Chu et al . , 2015 ) . We determined higher activities of lysosomal \u03b1-mannosidase and \u03b2-hexosaminidase in mutant nerve lysates ( Figure 3j ) , and note that increased compartment size and enzymatic activities are known phenomena of lysosomal disorders ( Sardiello and Ballabio , 2009 ) , yet associated with organelle dysfunction . Theoretically , complete peroxisomal failure in Cnp-Cre::Pex5flox/flox mice could perturb many aspects of SC metabolism in the observed neuropathy . However , we found that Cnp-Cre::Hsd17b4flox/flox mice ( referred to as MFP2 conditional knockout mice in the following ) , which specifically lack peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation ( Verheijden et al . , 2013 ) , share the key features of this novel phenotype , including ectopic internodal Kv1 . 1 clusters ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013e ) , confirming the important role for glial lipid metabolism in maintaining axonal membrane composition , and function . To investigate whether this new pathomechanism , identified in two mouse models with a glia-specific mutation , is also relevant for a human genetic disease , we analyzed ABCD1-deficient mice , a model for X-ALD/AMN ( Forss-Petter et al . , 1997 ) . Sciatic nerve axons and myelin were morphologically intact , even at 22 months of age ( Figure 4a\u2013c ) . However , ABCD1-mutants exhibited a similar mislocalization of Kv1 . 1 positive channels as observed in both conditional ( Pex5 and Mfp2 ) mutants . The quantification showed that mislocalization of internodal Kv1 . 1 was temporally progressive . In accordance with our model of membrane patches drifting into internodes , significant alterations were observed only at 22 months of age , but not yet at 2 months ( Figure 4d\u2013e ) . This pathology was accompanied by lysosomal accumulates in myelinated fibers ( Figure 4f\u2013h ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 23332 . 014Figure 4 .

Hypothetical model for\u00a0lipid turnover of\u00a0the juxtaparanodal anchoring complex of Kv1-channels . Myelin TAG-1 is stabilized by gangliosides ( GS , light green ) within juxtaparanodes ( JXP ) . For normal turnover ( left ) of JXP domains , SC require lysosomes ( purple ) and peroxisomes ( dark green ) that degrade GS ( indicated by curved pink arrow ) . When GS degradation is perturbed ( right ) , indicated by impaired peroxisomes ( red ) , GS accumulate within enlarged lysosomes ( purple ) , storage vesicles ( gray ) , and likely within JXP . Excess GS within JXP stabilize the protein complex containing TAG-1 ( yellow ) , CASPR2 ( red ) and Kv1 . 1 ( blue ) proteins , which thereby escape normal turnover , leading to domains breaking-off and drifting into internodes . Extra clusters possibly allow more K+ ( blue dots ) efflux ( curved gray arrow ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 23332 . 016 \n Our data suggest an important pathomechanism of peroxisomal dysfunction in peripheral nerves is the secondary impairment of lysosomes . For example , gangliosides , which are frequently esterified with VLCFA and 2-hydroxy fatty acids ( Chrast et al . , 2011; Sandhir et al . , 2000 ) , must be degraded in lysosomes . However , subsequent \u03b2-oxidation of VLCFA and 2-hydroxy fatty acids requires peroxisomes ( Foulon et al . , 2005; Wanders , 2014 ) . Thus , our mouse model provides first in vivo evidence for functional interactions between lysosomes and peroxisomes , so far only discussed for cultured cells ( Chu et al . , 2015 ) . One consequence of lysosomal impairment is the perturbation of normal ganglioside turnover . Gangliosides are in close association with Kv1-anchoring proteins ( Loberto et al . , 2003 ) and provide stability to the juxtaparanodal clusters ( Susuki et al . , 2007 ) , which resemble giant membrane 'lipid rafts' . As mechanism for ectopic localization of axonal Kv1 channels , we suggest the following working model ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) : Lack of ganglioside breakdown causes their accumulation in the glial juxtaparanodal membrane . Thereby , clusters of Kv1 and associated anchoring proteins ( TAG-1 and CASPR2 ) on the axonal side gain abnormal stability , break-off , diffuse into the internodal region , and escape from regular turnover . It is likely that also glial TAG-1 remains anchored to the axonal Kv1-/CASPR2-/TAG-1 clusters , but this cannot be distinguished by TAG-1 immunofluorescence . Kv1-channels are fast-opening , voltage-gated channels that are activated by mild voltage-shifts and thought to regulate fiber excitability ( Glasscock et al . , 2012 ) . The integrity of Kv1 channels is also impaired in CASPR2-/- mice , but perturbation of nerve function is not a feature ( Poliak et al . , 2003 ) . Unlike PEX5 mutant nerves , CASPR2-/- nerves do not exhibit elevated levels of Kv1 . 1 channel protein . Also , the ectopic Kv1 . 1+ clusters are situated directly adjacent to juxtaparanodes in CASPR2-deficient fibers , not along the internodes as observed in PEX5 mutants . Considering the severe progressive decline of nerve function in PEX5 mutant mice , which becomes clearly more affected with age ( data not shown ) , it is unlikely that a rather non-progressive pathology , that\u00a0is the shift of Kv1 into paranodes , is the underlying cause of conduction slowing . In contrast , the progressive shift of Kv1 toward internodes correlates well with disease progression . Theoretically , Kv1-mediated currents in the internode could hyperpolarize the axonal membrane and dampen the conductivity of spiking axons . Such \u2018feedback regulation\u2019 might prevent hyperexcitability , which is a feature of mice lacking Kv1 . 1 function ( Zhou et al . , 1998 ) . On the other hand , a \u2018gain-of-function\u2019 effect by opening additional ectopic internodal Kv1 channels , may contribute to a disturbed equilibrium of axonal ions causing slowed NCV and conduction blocks . Direct proof of this model would require patch clamping single axons underneath myelin , which is impossible at present . Peripheral neuropathy has been associated with numerous metabolic diseases , including AMN . In this clinically milder variant of ABCD1 loss-of-function mutations , the reduced NCV was assumed to reflect demyelination , which is a hallmark in the brain of severely affected patients . Similarly , conditional PEX5 knockout mice display a cerebral inflammatory demyelination , while such pathology is absent in sciatic nerves . This remarkable discrepancy between the peripheral and central nervous system pathology is currently unexplained and presumably related to differently responding cell populations ( Kassmann , 2014 ) . Also in ABCD1-deficient nerves neither demyelination nor axon degeneration , but ectopic axonal Kv1 channels was a progressive pathological feature as early as at 2 months of age , preceding the disease onset by more than 1 year ( Pujol et al . , 2002 ) . Our present findings therefore expand the emerging role of myelinating glial cells in maintaining axonal membrane composition and thereby influencing axonal function , independent of myelin itself . \n Cnp1Cre/+ and Pex5\ufb02ox/flox mice with C57/Bl6 genetic background were genotyped as described ( Kassmann et al . , 2007 ) . To check for recombination , genomic DNA was isolated from tail biopsies using the nexttec kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . PCR was performed with sense ( 5\u2019- CCAACGTCTGCCCATTCCTCCACCTG-3\u2019 ) and antisense primers ( 5\u2019- TTTGAGGATGGGAAGCAGTGCT \u22123\u2019 ) generating a 330 bp amplicon after Cre-mediated excision of the floxed Pex5 gene in conditional knockout mice . Hsd17b4\ufb02ox/flox ( Mfp2\ufb02ox/flox ) mice and Abcd1 knockout mice with C57/Bl6 genetic background were genotyped by PCR as described ( Verheijden et al . , 2013; Forss-Petter et al . , 1997 ) . Animals were maintained in individually ventilated cages under SPF conditions . For visualization of gangliosides sciatic nerves of Cnp-Cre::Pex5flox/flox mice and controls were dissected and pre-teased in artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( ACSF; 126 mM NaCl , 3 mM KCl , 1 , 25 mM NaH2PO4 , 26 mM NaHCO3 , 2 mM MgSO4 , 10 mM Glucose , 2 mM CaCla2 ) . Fiber bundles were incubated for 1 . 5 hr at room temperature with antibodies specific for GM1 or GD1a ( kindly provided by Hugh Willison , Glasgow ) . Samples were washed in ACSF , incubated with isotype-specific fluorescent secondary antibodies ( Alexa-488 IGg3 and IG2b goat anti-mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific , Massachusetts , USA ) , again washed in ACSF , fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 5 min , then washed in PBS containing 0 . 1 M glycine , teased on glass slides , air-dried , and stored at \u221220\u00b0C . For other antibody-labeling , sciatic nerves were dissected , teased and stored at \u221220\u00b0C as described previously ( Kassmann et al . , 2011 ) . For staining protein antigens , frozen teased fibers were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 5 min , permeabilized in methanol at \u221220\u00b0C for 3\u20135 min , PBS-washed , and blocked for 1 hr in PBS containing 10% horse serum and 0 . 05% Triton X-100 . Primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution were applied overnight at 4\u00b0C , specimens were washed in PBS , and incubated for 1 hr with fluorescent secondary antibodies Alexa-488 , Alexa-555 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , 1:2000 ) , and DyLight 633 ( 1:1000 , YO Proteins , Sweden ) . Cell nuclei were visualized with 4\u2032 , 6\u2032- diamidino-2-phenylindole ( DAPI; 1:10 . 000 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Fibers were mounted in AquaPolymount ( Polysciences , Pennsylvania , USA ) . Fluorescent images were acquired with an inverted Zeiss Axio Observer . Z1 equipped with an Axiocam MRm ( Zeiss , Germany ) . Mouse sciatic nerves were fixed overnight in 4% PFA , embedded in paraffin , and longitudinally sectioned ( 5 \u00b5m ) . For labeling , Dako LSAB2 system ( Dako , Denmark ) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions . All samples were analyzed by light microscopy ( Zeiss Axiophot ) . Mice were anesthetized with avertin ( 100 \u03bcl/10 g bodyweight ) and perfused intracardially with 15 ml HBSS ( Lonza , Switzerland ) , followed by 30 ml of fixative ( 0 . 2% glutaraldehyde , 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS ) . Sciatic nerves were dissected and post-fixed for 2\u20134 hr in 4% followed by overnight incubation in 1% PFA . Epon embedding of sciatic nerves was performed as described previously ( Kassmann et al . , 2007 ) . Semithin cross-sections ( 500 nm ) of sciatic nerves were incubated with methylene blue/Azur II and axons of entire cross-sections of sciatic nerves were analyzed by light microscopy ( Zeiss Axiophot ) . Quantification of axon number was performed using Fiji software . Preparation of ultrathin cryosections ( 50 nm ) was performed according to the Tokuyasu technique , and immunolabeling was carried out as previously described ( Werner et al . , 2007 ) . Antibody binding was visualized with protein A-gold ( 1:60 , 10 nm ) . Ultrathin sections ( 50 nm ) were contrasted with 1% uranyl acetate and lead citrate . Sections were examined with a LEO EM 912AB electron microscope ( Zeiss ) , and pictures were taken with an on-axis 2048 X 2048 CCD camera ( Proscan ) . Myelin thickness was evaluated using Fiji software by g-ratio analysis ( dividing the axonal by the fiber diameter ) derived from at least 100 randomly chosen fibers per nerve . Sciatic nerves were transferred to 200 \u00b5l ( per nerve ) ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 , 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1% NP-40 , and protease inhibitors ( Complete , Roche , Switzerland ) . Samples were homogenized using Precellys 24 ( VWR International , Dealware , USA ) , centrifuged for 10 min at 1000\u00a0g to remove cellular nuclei , and protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using Lowry assay ( Bio-rad Laboratories , California , USA ) . Blotting membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies . Western Lightning + ECL Kit ( Perkin Elmer , Massachusetts , USA ) was used to label protein bands , which were detected using Intas ChemoCam Image system . At least four biological replicates were analyzed . Quantification was performed in Fiji . 4 . 1G ( 1:100; kindly provided by E . Peles ) AnkG ( 1:100; kindly provided by M .

Nerve lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 15 , 000 g to remove cellular debris and nuclei . The supernatant was incubated with 10 mM of the substrate ( i . e . p-nitrophenyl-a-D-mannopyranosid or p-Nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-\u00df-D-glucosaminide; Sigma ) dissolved in 0 . 2 M citrate buffer , and the reaction was stopped by addition of 500 \u00b5l 0 . 4 M glycine NaOH ( pH 10 . 4; adjusted with 1 M NaOH ) to stop enzyme activity . Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 15 , 000 g , and the supernatants of two technical replicates were measured at 405 nm with an Eon microplate spectrophotometer ( BioTek , Vermont , USA ) . Total RNA was extracted from sciatic nerve lysates as described previously ( F\u00fcnfschilling et al . , 2012 ) . Reactions were performed with four technical replicates of nerves obtained from six different animals per group . PCR primers were specific for \u03b2-actin ( forward 5\u2032-CTTCCTCCCTGGAGAAGAGC and reverse 5\u2032-ATGCCACAGGATTCCATACC ) , Lamp1 ( forward 5\u2019-CCTACGAGACTGCGAATGGT and reverse 5\u2019-CCACAAGAACTGCCATTTTTC ) , Limp-2 ( forward 5\u2019-TGGAGATCCTAACGTTGACTTG and reverse 5\u2019-GGCCAGATCCACGACAGT ) , and Pex5 ( forward 5\u2019-CACATCCGCTTCCTATGACA and reverse 5\u2019-AAAAGGCTGAGGGTGGTCA ) . To quantify PE ( diacyl ) , PE O- ( alkanyl-acyl ) , and PE P- ( alkenyl-acyl ) species , acidic ( PE and PE O- ) or neutral ( PE P- ) lipid extractions were performed as described ( Bligh and Dyer , 1959 ) . Typically , 1\u20135 \u00b5l of a 1:10 dilution of total lysates were measured . As lipid standards , 50 pmol of PE standards and 40\u201360 pmol of a PE P- standards were used . Standard syntheses were performed as described ( \u00d6zbalci et al . , 2013; Paltauf and Hermetter , 1994 ) . After solvent evaporation under a gentle nitrogen flow at 37\u00b0C , lipids were re-suspended in 50 \u00b5l 10 mM ammonium acetate in methanol . PE/PE O- and PE P- species were analyzed in neutral loss or precursor ion mode selecting for class-specific fragments on a QTRAP5500 ( Sciex , Massachusetts , USA ) equipped with a NanoMate devise ( Advion , New York , USA ) , employing MS settings as described ( \u00d6zbalci et al . , 2013 ) . Data evaluation was done using LipidView ( AB\u00a0Sciex ) and an in-house-developed software ( ShinyLipids ) . Species annotated as PE O- mainly contain plasmenylethanoamines but also minor amounts of PE P- species and PE species with odd-numbered fatty acids . Extraction of gangliosides was performed as described ( Sampaio et al . , 2011 ) , with the exception that the first neutral extraction was performed using chloroform:methanol as a 17:1 ( v/v ) solution , followed by a chloroform:methanol 2:1 ( v/v ) extraction .

These stem cells regenerate and repair damaged tissues and organs for the entire lifetime of an animal , contributing to a healthy life . They divide to make daughter cells that become either new stem cells or specialized cells of that organ . Adult stem cells exist in specific areas within tissues known as niches , where they interact with surrounding cells and molecules that inform their behavior . For example , cells and molecules within these niches can signal stem cells to remain in a \u2018dormant\u2019 state , but upon injury , they can mobilize stem cells to form new tissue and repair the wound . So far , it has been unclear how stem cells sense damage and stress and direct their efforts away from their normal duties towards repair . Here , Lay et al . studied the stem cells in the mouse skin that are responsible to regenerate hair . Every hair follicle contains a niche ( the \u2018bulge\u2019 ) , where these stem cells live and share their environment with cells that anchor the hair . The niche tethers to the stem cells through specific adhesion molecules that also help the niche to form a tight seal to prevent bacteria from entering . Lay et al . removed one of the adhesion molecules called E-cadherin , which caused a breach in the niche\u2019s barrier . The stem cells sensed their damaged niche , prepared to multiply , and sent out stress signals to the immune system . The immune cells then arrived at the niche and sent signals back to the stem cells , prodding them to multiply and patch the barrier , while at the same time , keeping the inflammation in check . This remarkable ability of the stem cells to recruit immune cells and initiate a dialogue with them enabled the stem cells to divert their attention from regenerating hair and instead directing it towards the site of the tissue damage . Other stem cells , such as those in the lung or gut , may have similar mechanisms to detect and respond to physical damage . It will be interesting to investigate the underlying mechanism of how immune cells are involved in balancing stem cell regenerative capacity and response to physical damage . A better knowledge of these processes could help to regenerate tissues or even entire organs .", "source": "Adult stem cells are responsible for life-long tissue maintenance . They reside in and interact with specialized tissue microenvironments ( niches ) . Using murine hair follicle as a model , we show that when junctional perturbations in the niche disrupt barrier function , adjacent stem cells dramatically change their transcriptome independent of bacterial invasion and become capable of directly signaling to and recruiting immune cells . Additionally , these stem cells elevate cell cycle transcripts which reduce their quiescence threshold , enabling them to selectively proliferate within this microenvironment of immune distress cues . However , rather than mobilizing to fuel new tissue regeneration , these ectopically proliferative stem cells remain within their niche to contain the breach . Together , our findings expose a potential communication relay system that operates from the niche to the stem cells to the immune system and back . The repurposing of proliferation by these stem cells patch the breached barrier , stoke the immune response and restore niche integrity . \n Adult stem cells reside in most if not all tissues . They are endowed with the ability to self-renew long-term and differentiate into specialized cell lineages in order to maintain , renew and repair tissues . In turn , stem cells are heavily influenced by the tissue microenvironment in which they reside . Together , the tight interaction and cooperativity between stem cells and their niche allow stem cells to perform their critical task of maintaining tissue homeostasis and function throughout the lifetime of the organism . To date , most studies on the niche have focused on the various factors it secretes to control stem cell behavior during normal homeostasis . These factors include both positive and negative signals emanating from a diverse array of niche cells , including stromal cells , blood vessels , nerves and stem cell progeny ( Asada et al . , 2017; Hsu et al . , 2014a; Yu and Scadden , 2016 ) . Far less is known about how stem cells cope with perturbations in niche integrity and orchestrate responses to restore niche homeostasis . For epithelial tissue stem cells , this is particularly important , as they must respond quickly to and repair a breach in their epithelial barrier that excludes harmful microbes and retains essential fluids . In the current study , we tackle this problem by taking advantage of the relatively simple architecture of the hair follicle ( HF ) bulge , the niche in which stem cells of the HF reside ( Cotsarelis et al . , 1990; Hsu et al . , 2014a ) . The main part of the bulge is bilayered . It consists of a single concentric layer of stem cells that is sandwiched between a basement membrane on the outer side and a layer of terminally differentiated epithelial barrier \u2018niche\u2019 cells on the inner side . These \u2018inner bulge\u2019 niche cells are exposed to the external environment through an open channel that enables the hair to protrude from the skin surface ( Figure 1A ) . The cells derive from the stem cells , but they do not do so directly within the bulge . Rather , the barrier cells are generated late in the terminal differentiation pathway of stem cell progeny that produce the new hair ( Hsu et al . , 2011 ) . Indeed , besides forming this epithelial barrier , the bulge stem cells also fuel the episodic bouts of hair follicle ( HF ) regeneration ( \u2018anagen\u2019 ) needed to replenish the protective hair coat of the animal . In between episodic cycles of hair growth , the bulge exists in a resting state ( \u2018telogen\u2019 ) , anchoring the hair made in the previous hair cycle ( Figure 1A ) . At the bulge base ( \u2018hair germ\u2019 ) , quiescent stem cells interact with a specialized underlying mesenchymal structure , called the dermal papilla ( DP ) . This cross-talk is necessary to yield a threshold of activating factors ( BMP inhibitors , WNTs ) that launch a new hair cycle ( Hsu et al . , 2011 ) . Stem cells tether to their inner bulge niche through cadherins , the core transmembrane components of adherens junctions ( AJs ) , which coordinate intercellular adhesion , junctional integrity and proliferation in epithelial tissues ( Stepniak et al . , 2009; Takeichi , 2014 ) . AJs also stabilize tight junctions , which prevent passage of bacteria and other entities across an epithelial sheet ( R\u00fcbsam et al . , 2017; Tunggal et al . , 2005 ) . While bulge stem cells express both E- and P-cadherin , we discovered that the inner bulge niche expresses only E-cadherin . Here , we report that selective loss of E-cadherin within the inner bulge niche triggers a barrier breach that results in microbial invasion . We show that breached niche cells elevate an adhesive and cytoskeletal transcriptome . By contrast , the resident stem cells , which are normally quiescent , begin to proliferate in a fashion that we show is independent of microbial influence . Strikingly , they also activate a transcriptome that , when compared to proliferating anagen-phase stem cells in a normal niche , is similar in cell cycle genes , but differs in a cohort of immune-signaling genes . Moreover , although the cell cycle transcriptome lowers their threshold for quiescence , pushing them into proliferation requires this additional facet of the immune-signaling transcriptome . Indeed , the myriad of chemo-attractants , cytokines and growth factors induced by these stem cells when they experience a damaged niche is required to recruit immune cells into this otherwise purportedly \u2018immune privileged\u2019 site ( Meyer et al . , 2008; Paus and Bertolini , 2013 ) . The outcome of this atypical two-pronged path to stem cell proliferation , namely enhanced immune signaling and cell cycling , is a repurposing of new daughter stem cells from their normal task of tissue regeneration and towards patching the breached barrier . Our findings have strong relevance to a breadth of human skin conditions where progenitor cell proliferation is coupled to barrier breach . Our data reveal that stem cells have the potential to sense defects in the integrity of their niche and respond by activating two branches of a transcriptional program , which together cope with the compromised tissue function surrounding them . Additionally and importantly , we show that the niche is not merely a source of secreted factors that control stem cell activity and tissue growth . Rather , it is a key structural entity whose integrity is closely monitored by its vigilant stem cell residents . \n We became interested in the possibility that cadherins may function critically in HF stem cell niche integrity when we analyzed bulge cadherin expression during the extended , synchronized telogen phase of the second hair cycle in mice ( Figure 1A ) . E-cadherin localized to most epithelial cell-cell boundaries , displaying the strongest immuno-labeling at the interface between niche cells and stem cells . Conversely , P-cadherin specifically concentrated at stem cell intercellular junctions and was absent from niche cells . This was consistent with the\u00a0~20X higher Cdh3 transcript level in the stem cells versus niche cells . Indeed , as judged by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISAs ) on protein lysates of bulge stem cells [purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) of skin cell suspensions] , P-cadherin levels were even higher than E-cadherin ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and B ) . As expected from our expression data and the functional redundancy of these cadherins ( Tinkle et al . , 2008 ) , P-cadherin ( Cdh3 ) null mice ( Radice et al . , 1997 ) displayed a normal hair coat and hair cycle ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . E-cadherin was maintained at all cell-cell junctions within the P-cadherin depleted bulge , and hair germ cells became proliferative on cue during early anagen ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . To explore the functional consequences of E-cadherin loss of function ( loss of function ) in the bulge , we conditionally ablated its gene ( Cdh1 ) in Cdh1fl/fl; Rosa26lox-STOP-lox-YFP reporter mice by using a tamoxifen ( TAM ) -inducible CreER knocked into the endogenous locus of Sox9 . By inducing Cdh1 ablation near the beginning of 2nd telogen ( postnatal day P50 ) , E-cadherin was efficiently depleted throughout the bulge when analyzed 3 weeks later ( Figure 1B ) . Cdh1-null HF stem cells continued to display AJs along stem cell-stem cell borders , reflective of P-cadherin compensation ( Figure 1C and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A and B ) . In fact , by immunoblot analyses and quantifications of proteins from FACS-purified \u03b16+CD34+ HF stem cells , P-cadherin levels in E-cadherin deficient HF stem cells were even higher than normal ( Figure 1D and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C ) , a feature confirmed by knocking down Cdh1 transcripts through shRNA ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D ) . By contrast , the Cdh1-null inner bulge layer lacked P-cadherin and in turn AJs on all cell-cell borders ( Figure 1C ) . Since AJ formation requires intercellular cadherin-cadherin binding , this also left the stem cell-niche interface devoid of AJs . This was best exemplified by the paucity of p120-catenin at this interface ( arrows in Figure 1C ) . Notably , p120-catenin binds directly to classical cadherins and is required for AJ stabilization . Immunoblot analyses confirmed the overall reduction in these other AJ proteins , despite upregulation of P-cadherin in stem cells within the Cdh1-depleted bulge ( Figure 1D ) . AJs form an intercellular network of F-actin across an epithelial sheet of keratinocytes ( Vaezi et al . , 2002; Vasioukhin et al . , 2000 ) . In wild-type HFs , F-actin organization was particularly robust within the inner bulge , suggesting a special role for the cytoskeletal-intercellular networks within this layer of niche cells . However , in the absence of E-cadherin , the actin cytoskeletal organization was markedly perturbed throughout the inner bulge , including the stem cell-niche interface ( Figure 1E ) . Probing deeper , we next examined tight junctions . As shown in Figure 1F and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E , the expression , localization , continuity and stability of tight junction proteins were largely intact in the CD34+\u00a0stem cells , but disrupted in the niche cells of the bulge . Moreover , when we tested for tight junction integrity by exposing HFs to Lucifer yellow , the dye penetrated the inner bulge layer deficient for E-cadherin ( Figure 1G ) . Although our findings underscored the importance of E-cadherin in maintaining AJs , tight junctions and the integrity of the niche , niche cells were not lost from the bulge: desmosomes were still present in seemingly normal morphology , numbers and localization , and intercellular membranes at the niche-stem cell interface were still sealed ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A and B ) . The inner bulge layer also remain adhered to the club hair via \u2018half-desmosomal\u2019 structures as previously described for WT bulge ( Hsu et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C ) . As in the normal hair cycle , telogen-phase stem cells in Cdh1-heterozygous HFs were quiescent until anagen onset , when their proliferation initiated first within the hair germ ( AnaI ) , and several days later within the bulge ( AnaII-III; Figure 2A , first three panels ) ( Hsu et al . , 2014b ) . Upon homozygous Cdh1 ablation , however , telogen-phase bulge stem cell residents began proliferating ( Figure 2A , fourth panel; quantifications at right ) . In striking contrast to the normal hair cycle , this was neither preceded nor accompanied by hair germ proliferation . Normally , whether in homeostasis or in response to a wound , for\u00a0example hair plucking , HF stem cell proliferation results in progeny that exit their niche and launch a new round of hair cycling ( Hsu et al . , 2011; Morris et al . , 2004; Tumbar et al . , 2004 ) . By contrast , the daughters of proliferative events in the telogen Cdh1-null bulge remained within the niche ( Figure 2A ) . Moreover , these HFs actually spent longer than normal in telogen prior to entering a new round of hair growth ( Figure 2B ) . These results indicated that the normal telogen phase cues were still intact , which we later document further . Instead of being utilized to launch a new hair cycle , this telogen-phase stem cell proliferation produced additional bulge layers , readily evident by 5 weeks post-Cdh1 ablation ( Figure 2C ) . Daughters retained stem cell identity as judged by bulge stem cell markers CD34 and LHX2 , and by factors such\u00a0as\u00a0TCF4 and SOX9 , which are expressed but not exclusively by HF stem cells ( Figure 2D and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Quantifications revealed a significant expansion of stem cell numbers within the Cdh1-null bulge ( Figure 2D ) . Despite the increased proliferation in telogen , Cdh1-null HF stem cells were still sensitive to the activating cues of the hair cycle , and returned to a non-dividing state as inhibitory levels rose in subsequent anagen and telogen ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . This further suggested that the normal cues that govern hair cycling were still in place . We next addressed whether the bulge stem cells proliferated because of their own Cdh1 loss or that of the niche . Since changes in AJs can impact proliferation ( Stepniak et al . , 2009 ) , we first considered whether the elevated P-cadherin seen in the Cdh1-null stem cells might be involved . However , when we engineered mice whose skin epithelium was selectively transduced with doxycycline ( Doxy ) -inducible Cdh3 , we saw no significant effect on stem cell proliferation upon induction of P-cadherin over-expression ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Next , we used Krt15-CrePGR mice ( Morris et al . , 2004 ) to selectively ablate Cdh1 in bulge stem cells during the extended 2nd telogen ( Figure 2E and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . Strikingly , the ectopic stem cell proliferation and expansion of bulge layers that we had observed upon Cdh1 ablation in both stem cells and inner bulge , did not occur upon stem cell-specific ablation ( Figure 2F ) . These data pointed to perturbations within the niche as the source of the stimulus for neighboring stem cells to proliferate . Since the inner bulge niche is derived from stem cell progeny that terminally differentiate towards the end of the hair cycle ( Hsu et al . , 2011 ) , we could test our hypothesis by monitoring Krt15CrePGR-activated Cdh1 cKO mice through subsequent hair cycles , when E-cadherin was also lost in the niche ( Figure 2E ) . Indeed , bulge stem cells proliferated and expanded concomitant with E-cadherin loss within the inner bulge ( Figure 2G ) . Finally , by titrating down the TAM dosage administered to Sox9CreER; Cdh1fl/fl; Rosa26lox-STOP-lox-YFP mice , we restricted Cre activity to the inner bulge layer ( Hsu et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . Notably , selective Cdh1 ablation in the inner bulge niche was sufficient to elicit an architectural shift to a triple layered bulge , even though the stem cells were now WT ( Figure 2H ) . Together , these findings suggest that bulge stem cell proliferation may rely at least in part upon the direct interface between the stem cells and their defective inner bulge niche . The inability of the Cdh1 null inner bulge to retain dye ( Figure 1G ) suggested that its integrity is needed to provide a protective barrier to the external environment . Upon testing this possibility , we found that in contrast to controls , Cdh1 cKO HFs were infiltrated with microbes , as shown both by Gram-positive ( deep violet ) and Gram-negative ( pink ) bacterial stains and by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) for a pan-bacterial 16S rRNA ( Figure 3A and B ) . These findings highlighted the importance of a healthy inner bulge niche in guarding its stem cells and the skin against microbial infiltration . A priori , the stem cells might be responding to these microbes that infiltrate the breached barrier , rather than the damaged niche per se . To test for the impact of these infiltrating bacteria , we treated mice with antibiotics to deplete bacteria from the skin . As judged by in situ hybridization for 16S ribosomal RNA , microbes were efficiently thwarted ( Figure 3B ) . Despite efficient microbial clearing , the Cdh1 cKO bulge still remained proliferative and hyper-thickened ( Figure 3C ) . Altogether , while our findings do not discount a role for bacterial signals , they rule them out as the instigating factor in causing stem cell proliferation when the niche barrier was breached . Upon barrier breach , a swarm of immune cells , positive for the pan-leukocyte marker CD45 , selectively surrounded the bulge ( Figure 4A ) . Although CD45+\u00a0numbers per unit area of skin varied , when we quantified the number of CD45+\u00a0cells within a 25 \u03bcm radius of the bulge , we consistently observed a marked and statistically significant increase in immune cells surrounding the Cdh1 null bulge as compared to the WT control bulge ( Figure 4C , Cdh1-null bulge [Sox9CreER] vs control ) . Given the microbial invasion , an immune response was expected . Yet surprisingly , we found that immune cells had already begun to accumulate by D23 post Cdh1 ablation , before the increase in 16S rRNA and shift to a triple layered bulge architecture which were robust only by D35 ( Figures 2C and 4B ) . Moreover , when we depleted bacteria with antibiotics , immune cells were still recruited to the breached niche ( Figure 4C and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . By contrast , when we used Krt15CrePGR-activated mice to selectively ablate Cdh1 from 2nd telogen HF stem cells , immune cells were not recruited until subsequent hair cycles , when the inner bulge layer became Cdh1-null ( Figure 4C and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B and C ) . A robust immune response also encircled the bulge when we ablated Cdh1 selectively in the inner bulge and not in stem cells ( Figure 4C and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . While many immune cells , including dendritic cells ( DCs ) , macrophages , \u03b3\u03b4 dendritic epidermal T cells ( DETCs ) , \u03b3\u03b4 TCR+\u00a0dermal T cells , and \u03b1\u03b2TCR+\u00a0dermal T cells , are known to be residents of the skin ( Naik et al . , 2015; Scharschmidt et al . , 2017; Scharschmidt et al . , 2015 ) , this immune response arising from the breached niche went well beyond the normal surveillance status of the immune system . Moreover , the composition of the CD45+\u00a0immune cells that infiltrated the breached bulge showed clear differences from the normal resident immune cell patterns . Most notable was the increase in immunostaining for CD3+\u00a0T cells and CD11b+\u00a0myeloid lineage cells , including MHC-class II+ dendritic cells and F4/80+\u00a0macrophages ( Figure 4D and E and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . To further characterize , distinguish and quantify these cell types , we used these and additional markers to analyze immune cells by flow cytometry ( Figure 4D\u20134F and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F and G ) . We observed a significant increase in the MHCII+\u00a0CD11c+\u00a0cells ( Figure 4D ) which are defined as dendritic cells since these cells are also negative/low for CD64 , Mertk or Ly6C ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F ) . Additionally , although CD64+\u00a0Mertk+ macrophage numbers were more variable , and hence not statistically significant , they did follow a trend of being higher than normal , and preferentially associating with the breached niche ( Figure 4D and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . Focusing on T cells that were concentrated near breached bulge niches , \u03b3\u03b4 T cell and DETC numbers were comparable between WT and Cdh1 cKO skins , although DETC numbers were quite variable even among control samples ( Figure 4E ) . By contrast , \u03b1\u03b2 T cells showed marked and statistically significant increases in Cdh1 cKO skins ( Figure 4E ) . Many of these T cells were positive for FOXP3 , a marker for regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) , and further quantification revealed statistically significant increases in both absolute numbers and percentages of Tregs relative to the total \u03b1\u03b2 T cell population ( Figure 4F and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1G ) . Moreover , Treg numbers surrounding the bulge were markedly higher than the normal skin resident population ( Figure 4F ) . Our data thus far indicated that the ability to elicit an immune response was independent of microbial presence , but dependent upon the barrier breach within the niche . A priori , this could mean that Cdh1-null inner bulge cells produce the chemokines that recruit the immune cells . Alternatively , upon detecting an AJ-deficient interface with the breached niche , stem cells , whether Cdh1-null or wild-type , might respond by producing and transmitting stress signals to the immune system . To distinguish between these possibilities , we FACS-purified and transcriptionally profiled inner bulge niche cells ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) and stem cells ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C ) from telogen-phase Cdh1 cKO and control littermate bulges . To tease out changes specific to stem cells residing in the breached niche , we also performed RNA-sequencing ( RNA-seq ) on WT bulge stem cells in anagen II/III , that\u00a0is the only time when they naturally proliferate ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Our data were consistent across independent replicates , enabling us to generate molecular signatures of transcripts that were differentially expressed ( p-value<0 . 05 , absolute fold-change [FC]\u22651 . 5 ) in either niche cells ( 1070\u2191 , 1058\u2193 ) or stem cells ( 1194\u2191 , 793\u2193 ) from Cdh1-null versus control bulges ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Scrutinizing the specific genes within each of the top four KEGG pathway categories of the Cdh1-null inner bulge profile , we found that transcripts encoding cell adhesion , proteoglycans and cytoskeletal-associated proteins were featured highly , consistent with a feedback attempt by these junction-compromised cells to restore the barrier , while metabolic pathways were downregulated ( Figure 5A and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . By contrast , cell cycle genes and immune signaling and response genes dominated the most highly changed pathways in the stem cells from Cdh1-null bulge niches ( Figure 5B\u20135D , upper Venn diagram and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E and F ) . Moreover , in contrast to these proliferative stem cells within the telogen Cdh1-null niche , neither proliferative WT stem cells within an Ana II/III WT bulge nor quiescent WT stem cells within a telogen WT bulge showed expression of these immune pathway genes ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G ) . Principal Component Analyses further highlighted these marked distinctions between proliferative bulge stem cells devoted to normal tissue growth and those repurposed here to add cell layers to the damaged niche ( Figure 5E ) . Our analyses also revealed salient differences in the transcriptional responses of niche versus stem cells within the damaged bulge ( Figure 5D , bottom Venn diagram ) . This was true even for categories with some apparent overlap , such as cytokine:cytokine receptor interaction transcripts ( Figure 5A and B ) . Indeed , closer inspection of individual genes within this and related immune cell categories of the niche transcriptome revealed that levels of these niche transcripts were often considerably lower and less significant than in their stem cell neighbors ( Figure 5F ) . By contrast , of the cytokine and chemokine genes that were highly changed in the stem cell transcriptome ( Figure 5C ) , most were substantially more highly expressed by these stem cells than their Cdh1-null niche neighbors , even when the stem cells surrounding a Cdh1-null inner bulge niche were wild-type ( Figure 5G ) . Ccl1 and Ccl2 were the top two most highly upregulated genes in this stem cell cohort ( 184X , 38X; Figure 5C ) , and like most of this transcriptome , were barely expressed by the neighboring breached niche . Notably , CCL1 and CCL2 are established chemokines for both DCs and macrophages ( Cantor and Haskins , 2007; Gombert et al . , 2005; Li and Tai , 2013; Moser et al . , 2004 ) . Importantly , not only were Ccl1 , Ccl2 and many other features of these signatures robustly expressed by the HF stem cells experiencing a breached niche , but this response still occurred even when microbial infiltration was repressed ( Figure 5H ) . This suggested that the stem cells recruited immune cells in direct response to the damaged niche rather than the bacteria that infiltrated . Since CCL2 is an established chemokine for the CCR2 receptor , expressed by both DCs and macrophages , we focused first on the potential interactions between stem cells and these immune cells . To mimic the damaged niche microenvironment in vitro , we used Cdh1-null HF stem cells , which retained elevated Ccl2 in culture ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1H ) . We then tested their ability against WT HF stem cells to recruit bone marrow-derived DCs and macrophages in transwell migration assays . As shown in Figure 5I , a\u00a0significant increase occurred in chemotaxis of bone marrow-derived DCs . Moreover , this difference was abolished when we used DCs that lacked CCR2 . On the other hand , while the migration of macrophages in response to Cdh1-null HF stem cells followed a similar trend , the difference was highly variable and thus not statistically significant . Strikingly , these in vitro patterns of DC and macrophage migration were consistent with our in vivo immune cell profiling ( Figure 4D ) , and revealed that Cdh1-null but not WT stem cells can directly attract DCs , and to a lesser extent macrophages , through a CCL2-CCR2-dependent mechanism . Conversely , CCL1 stimulates CCR8 receptors , which are on the surface of DCs and macrophages . To test the significance of HF stem cell CCL1 , we repeated the cell migration assays as above , this time using a CCR8 blocking antibody to disrupt a potential CCL1-CCR8 interaction . Interestingly , while the reduction in chemotactic response of DCs and macrophages was not as robust as blocking the CCL2-CCR2 axis ( Figure 5J ) , treatment of CCR2-null DCs or macrophages with CCR8 blocking antibody to simultaneously block both CCL1 and CCL2-mediated chemotaxis further reduced their migration to statistically significant levels ( Figure 5I ) . These findings were important as they indicated that HF stem cells experiencing a barrier breach in their niche can activate chemokines and directly recruit the immune cells that we see elevated upon a barrier breach . Why DC recruitment in vivo appeared to be more consistent than macrophage recruitment is not clear . However , it is notable that DCs and macrophages respond to similar chemokines during recruitment , and depending upon the particular cytokine milieu , differentiation of inflammatory monocytes can be skewed to DCs or macrophages ( Geissmann et al . , 2010 ) . We next addressed whether immune cells are required to trigger the stem cell proliferation that generated a thickened bulge . We waited until D18 post-Tam treatment , when Cdh1 was ablated , but immune cells had not yet been recruited to the bulge ( Figure 4B ) . We then administered the immunosuppressant dexamethasone ( Dex ) daily for\u00a0~2 . 5 weeks , and analyzed mice . At this time , untreated counterparts were swarmed by CD45+\u00a0immune cells and the bulge was hyperthickened ( Figure 6A ) . While not eliminating the resident skin immune cells , Dex effectively blocked the immune infiltration that otherwise surrounded the breached niche barrier in Cdh1 cKO HFs ( Figure 6A ) . Significantly , Dex-treated Cdh1 cKO HFs also displayed normal bulge architecture ( Figure 6B ) . Accordingly , both the telogen-phase proliferation displayed by stem cells in their deficient niche , and the concomitant increase in stem cell numbers , were now abolished . This was further reflected by the enhanced BMP-signaling effector phosphorylated-SMAD1 ( Figure 6B ) , which in normal stem cells only diminishes in Anagen II/III when the natural activating cues override BMP quiescence signals from the inner bulge niche ( Hsu et al . , 2014b ) . That said , even in the absence of Dex , there were still signs that the normal telogen signals were intact in the Cdh1-null bulge . Thus , inner bulge-derived BMP6 , a prerequisite for these pSMAD1 signaling dynamics , was still expressed by the Cdh1-null inner bulge cells , and correspondingly , the HF stem cells experiencing the breached niche still expressed BMP target genes , including Nfatc1 and Foxc1 ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Since ablating only one immune component can have a profound effect on the remaining immune cell repertoire , it was necessary to use total immune cell suppression , rather than genetic ablation of specific immune cell populations . Although Dex impacts full-anagen phase HFs by inducing their early entry into the destructive phase ( Kwack et al . , 2017 ) , our study focused on telogen , where no adverse effects of Dex had been reported . However , it was important to assess whether it was suppression of the immune response or Dex itself that was impacting stem cell proliferation . As shown in the growth curves in Figure 6B , Dex alone did not inhibit HF stem cell proliferation directly . Moreover , bacteria were still present in immunosuppressed skin , arguing against their involvement in the proliferation dynamics observed here ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . This finding also added to the evidence that the microbial infiltration arose from the loss of junctional integrity within the Cdh1-null niche , and not from the associated architectural disturbances caused by stem cell proliferation in the Cdh1-null niche . Given these collective results , we focused on immune cell infiltration as the root of stem cell proliferation and expanded bulge structure . Thus far , our immune analyses indicated that DCs and Tregs were elevated prominently and specifically around the breached barrier ( Figure 4 ) . Closer inspection revealed that DCs and Tregs were closely associated with each other when surrounding the breached niche , and Dex treatment markedly blocked their infiltration into the Cdh1-null bulge niche ( Figure 6C ) . Moreover , the immunosuppressive effects of Dex appeared to be specific for the immune infiltration to the bulge , as immune cells elsewhere in the skin remained during the Dex treatment ( Figure 6C ) . In this regard , the Dex-treated Cdh1-cKO pattern of CD3+\u00a0and MHCII+\u00a0immune cells resembled that of untreated control skin ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Since Dex blocked immune infiltration into the breached niche , and since immune infiltration was essential for the specific proliferation of bulge stem cells that we observed , we turned to in vitro studies to address whether DCs or Tregs might directly affect HF stem cell proliferation . For this purpose , we purified and activated DCs as before ( Figure 5I and J ) , and employed established protocols ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) to stimulate freshly isolated splenic na\u00efve CD4+\u00a0T cells with CD3/CD28 antibodies ( conventional T cells; Tconv ) . For Treg induction , we also added TGF\u03b2 ( Fantini et al . , 2007 ) . By compartmentalizing the immune cells , we then assessed the effects of their secreted factors on the proliferation of HF stem cells . As shown in Figure 6D , while DCs showed no appreciable effect on HF stem cells , Tregs appeared to be particularly robust in soliciting a proliferative response . In wild-type skin , resident Tregs , which are positive for NOTCH ligand JAG1 , have been proposed to promote HF stem cell proliferation through direct engagement and activation of Notch target genes ( Ali et al . , 2017 ) . If so , we might have expected to see an elevation of Notch target genes in the stem cells of the Cdh1 null bulge , given the marked elevation of Tregs within close proximity . That said , the most striking canonical NOTCH target gene showing sensitivity to dexamethasone was Hey1 , and in this case , transcripts were up , rather than down when the Treg swarm was diminished ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . We also examined the status of a cohort of HF stem cell genes reported to bind activated NOTCH in a ChIP-seq analysis of a muscle cell line ( Castel et al . , 2013 ) ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . Indeed , most of these and established NOTCH target genes were very lowly expressed in normal telogen phase HF stem cells , consistent with the well-documented role for NOTCH signaling in HF differentiation , rather than bulge stem cell proliferation ( Demehri and Kopan , 2009 ) . Importantly , NOTCH target genes were not elevated appreciably in HF stem cells when the niche barrier was altered and swarmed with Tregs . Rather , we surmise that Tregs\u2019 proliferative effects that we observed on HF stem cells here are more likely to be rooted in amphiregulin and/or keratinocyte growth factor , known to be robustly expressed by Tregs in an inflammatory setting ( Arpaia et al . , 2015; Dial et al . , 2017 ) . Similarly , in some contexts , the tension sensor YAP , is retained by \u03b1-catenin in the cytoplasm and becomes nuclear upon a loss of adherens junctions ( Li et al . , 2016; Neto et al . , 2018; Schlegelmilch et al . , 2011 ) , leading to a marked increase in target genes of the YAP/TEAD transcription factor complex ( Liu and Wang , 2015; Zanconato et al . , 2015; Zhang et al . , 2011 ) . Since the telogen-phase HF stem cells in a Cdh1-mutant niche were proliferative , and YAP is known to influence proliferation , the elevation in Ccne1 and other YAP target genes governing proliferation seemed at first glance to suggest altered YAP activity . However , Dex treatment largely normalized these cell cycle-related differences , and most other YAP target genes showed no major changes in expression irrespective of immune suppression ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . In the absence of expression changes attributable to Cdh1 status , and given the multiple alternative and possibly confounding means by which YAP is known to be regulated ( Deng et al . , 2018; Totaro et al . , 2018 ) , we did not pursue this further . Finally , to identify the portion of the stem cell transcriptome signature that is independent of immune cell infiltration , we performed RNA-seq on stem cells isolated from Dex-treated Cdh1-null and control bulges of telogen-phase HFs and compared their transcriptomes to their non-treated counterparts . A total of 509 genes were found to be significantly upregulated in stem cells from Dex-treated Cdh1-null versus control niches . Of these , 392 genes ( 77% ) were also upregulated in their non-treated counterparts ( Figure 7A ) . Despite stem cells being un-proliferative under Dex treatment , the top KEGG pathway enriched among these 392 overlapping genes was still cell cycle ( Figure 7B ) . Although the expression of these cell cycle transcripts was dampened by immunosuppressive conditions ( Figure 7C , purple vs . red bars ) , they were still significantly upregulated , independent of both Dex treatment ( Figure 7C , purple vs . green bars ) and Cdh1 loss ( Figure 7C , orange vs . blue bars ) . A similar trend was observed for many of the immune response genes , whose expression persisted in HF stem cells in a breached niche even under immunosuppressive conditions ( Figure 7D ) . Taken together , our findings suggested that the necessary threshold level of cell cycle transcripts required to push telogen-phase stem cells into proliferation was contributed in part by the Cdh1-null niche and in part by the ability of these stem cells to recruit immune cells . Seeking why telogen-phase proliferation of stem cells was dependent upon not only immune cells but also niche status , we were drawn once again to the reduction in adherens junction proteins that stem cells experienced when they resided in the Cdh1-null bulge niche ( Figure 1C and D ) . An inverse correlation between adherens junctions and cell proliferation is well-established ( Stepniak et al . , 2009 ) , and our findings here pointed to a potential link at the transcriptional level . Of additional note , many of the immune response transcripts that remained elevated in the HF stem cells of Dex-treated cKO skin were putative NFkB target genes , including Tnfa , Ccl2 , Ccl1 , Csf1 , Cxcl1 and Ccl20 ( Figure 7E ) . Previously , we showed that when p120-catenin ( Ctnnd1 ) is conditionally ablated in skin epithelia , IkB kinase ( IKK ) activity is elevated , resulting in the phosphorylation of IkB\u03b1 and the release of the transcription factor NFkB into the nucleus ( Perez-Moreno et al . , 2006 ) . Intriguingly , by immunofluorescence , NFkB showed nuclear localization in telogen-phase Cdh1-null HF stem cells ( Figure 7F ) , which also had reduced p120 levels ( Figure 1C and D ) . Although dexamethasone has been reported to dampen NFkB signaling by elevating IkB\u03b1 transcription ( Auphan et al . , 1995; Scheinman et al . , 1995 ) , it only had a partial effect in Cdh1-null HF stem cells under conditions where IkB\u03b1 phosphorylation was enhanced ( Figure 7E ) . While further details are beyond the scope of the present study , our results suggest a mechanism whereby when the barrier is breached , reductions in adherens junctions impacts the activity of transcription factors such as NFkB , that can directly alter the transcriptional landscape of the HF stem cells in a way that promotes immune cell recruitment , and reduces , but does not overcome , the threshold for proliferation ( Figure 8 and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2D ) . \n The most important function of the skin epithelium is to provide the barrier that excludes harmful microbes and retains body fluids . When the barrier is breached , it must be repaired expeditiously to restore fitness to the animal . HFs extend deep into the skin , leaving an entry site for pathogens . The bulge niche of HF stem cells is strategically positioned at the base of this orifice that opens to the external environment . In our current study , we show that in addition to its role as a source of inhibitory signals for its stem cells ( Hsu et al . , 2011 ) , the inner bulge provides the barrier that protects stem cells from microbial invasion . In exploring how stem cells cope when their barrier is breached , we learned that by co-expressing P- and E-cadherin , the stem cells themselves are protected from the many situations where E-cadherin levels are naturally downregulated , which includes stem cell activation at the start of the hair cycle ( Lay et al . , 2016 ) . Our new data substantiates this further , as when E-cadherin is lost from HF stem cells , they markedly upregulate P-cadherin . Through their immediate proximity to the inner bulge layer , the HF stem cells are poised to sense a barrier breach . Remarkably , our studies revealed that neither bacteria nor immune cells were required for this sensing to occur . Although the precise details await further investigation , the roots are likely to reside in the inability of stem cells to form adherens junctions with their Cdh1-null niche neighbors , which lack a cadherin backup system . As our data revealed , intercellular cadherin-cadherin junctions are featured prominently at the stem cell-niche interface of healthy HF bulges . Such junctions are known to act as key signaling centers and integrators of proliferation , polarity and the actin cytoskeleton across an epithelial tissue ( Padmanabhan et al . , 2015; Stepniak et al . , 2009 ) , and our current findings add to the mounting evidence that these junctions also serve as key regulators of inflammatory sensors ( Perez-Moreno et al . , 2006 ) . As we learned , once stem cells face a breach in their niche barrier , they trigger a distress transcriptional program that we show occurs even in the face of antibiotics or immune suppressive drugs and is strikingly different from the response elicited in the neighboring niche cells . Our findings are interesting in light of prior studies showing that under a number of different conditions , keratinocytes can express cytokines and chemokines that harbor potential to communicate with the immune system in normal homeostasis and in injury ( Adachi et al . , 2015; Ali et al . , 2017; Chen et al . , 2015; Pasparakis et al . , 2002; Zhang et al . , 2004 ) . Of additional relevance to our study are previous observations that hair plucking enhances hair cycling , an effect which has been postulated on the one hand to be triggered by the loss of the BMP-expressing inner bulge niche cells ( Hsu et al . , 2011 ) but on the other hand to an elevation of Ccl2 and inflammatory macrophages in the skin ( Chen et al . , 2015 ) . While intriguing , none of these prior studies have revealed whether stem cells are specifically capable of altering their transcriptional program in response to perturbations in their microenvironment and if they can , whether this endows them with the ability to adjust their behavior by directly recruiting immune cells . Notably , Ccl2 was also at the top of our changed genes , along with related Ccl1 , underscoring their sensitivity to skin perturbations , and tracing their expression to stem cells . However , in our system , when the entire immune repertoire was analyzed and quantified relative to bulge proximity , DCs were among the most consistently changed early immune respondents . Like M1 macrophages , DCs have surface receptors that respond to CCL1/2 ( Gombert et al . , 2005; Moser et al . , 2004 ) . Moreover , by in vitro co-culture and genetic targeting of the corresponding DC-CCL receptors , we showed that DCs use this crosstalk with HF stem cells to specifically congregate around the bulge . In this case , however , recruitment of DCs and ( more variably ) macrophages did not trigger a new hair cycle , pointing to a major difference between disrupting the barrier function of the BMP6-expressing inner niche layer and removing this layer altogether as in hair plucking which does initiate a new hair cycle . During normal epithelial homeostasis , resident DCs can dialogue with Tregs ( Leventhal et al . , 2016; Seneschal et al . , 2012 ) , and thus may also be capable on their own to shape the adaptive immune response that swarmed the damaged niche . Although our co-localization data and accumulation of Tregs with DCs around the bulge are supportive of this mechanism , our transcriptomics revealed that independently of immune cells , stem cells within a damaged niche are also well-equipped with a complex arsenal of cytokines and chemokines to communicate with both the adaptive and innate immune systems . Such chemokines include CCL1 ( Hoelzinger et al . , 2010; Scharschmidt et al . , 2017 ) and CCL20 , which are both potent stimuli for Tregs . Recently , it was shown that in normal homeostasis , Tregs come into close proximity of the bulge towards the telogen to anagen transition , where in addition to BMP-inhibitors , WNTs and other activating cues , they help to fuel hair regeneration ( Ali et al . , 2017 ) . Although Treg ablation studies suggested a role for Tregs in hair cycling , it has remained unknown whether such effects are direct or indirect . Our findings here showed that proliferative effects of Tregs on HF stem cells can be direct . It is curious that in homeostasis ( Ali et al . , 2017 ) and hair plucking ( Chen et al . , 2015 ) , stem cells are stimulated to proliferate and launch new hair growth , while in the face of a barrier breach , stem cells direct their efforts towards containing the damage . Based upon the evidence at hand , this difference likely resides in the plethora of growth factors , cytokines , reactive oxygen species , and lipid mediators that are generated by immune cells under different conditions ( Demehri et al . , 2008; Yoon et al . , 2016 ) . Although the precise nature of this complex communication between the stem cells and immune cells is beyond the scope of the current study , we have shown that it is considerably more robust and diverse than that which functions in normal hair cycling or transient injury response . That said , the collective evidence points to an important role for stem cells in sensing and responding to their local environment . Their ability to subsequently recruit distinct immune cell repertoires enables stem cells to receive new sets of instructions that deviate from their normal homeostatic state , thereby channeling their efforts in new directions . This intricate feedback mechanism enables the recruited immune cells to repurpose stem cells from their normal job of making hair to instead participate in curbing the breached barrier . This diversion of HF stem cells away from their normal regenerative function had two important outcomes . First , it added a new layer of AJ-competent cells to line/reinforce the damaged bulge . Second , because the activated stem cells transcribed an array of immune signaling genes , their amplification within the niche bolstered the local production of distress signals . Altogether , this captivating communication network appeared to be aimed at patching the breached barrier\u00a0and\u00a0limiting tissue damage that would otherwise be caused by chronic inflammation . Indeed , the ensuing immune\u00a0cell-associated\u00a0\u2018hyperthickening\u2019 phenotype was locally restricted to the site of the barrier breach ( Figure 8 and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2D ) . Since our breached HF barrier model was a genetic one , it was not surprising that the efforts of the HF stem cells to patch the barrier were futile , as evidenced by the bacterial infiltration seen in the Cdh1-null HFs and their surrounding tissue ( Figure 3 ) . Indeed , there are a number of genetic disorders involving breached skin barriers in which stem cells hyper-proliferate and yet are unable to repair the barrier . In this regard , it is intriguing to consider epidermolytic hyperkeratosis patients and mice , which harbor suprabasal epidermal keratin one and/or keratin 10 mutations . In this case , the healthy epidermal stem cells respond to the barrier breach , but they maintain a single layer of proliferative progenitors , while dramatically expanding the ( defective ) layers of terminally differentiating cells ( Fuchs et al . , 1992 ) . By contrast , the proliferative Cdh1 null HF stem cells cannot directly generate the terminally differentiated barrier cells ( Hsu et al . , 2011 ) , and instead generate multiple layers of stem cells . While neither of these responses are successful , they likely reflect a general , evolutionarily conserved mechanism intrinsic within epithelial stem cells to respond to and repair barrier defects wherever they emerge . Studies in Drosophila testis and ovary have long established a role for E-cadherin in adhering germline stem cells to their niche , a process critical to balancing stem cell self-renewal and differentiation ( Song et al . , 2002; Yamashita et al . , 2003 ) . Although the roles of AJs in mammalian stem cell niches have not been studied extensively , the increased HF stem cell proliferation could reflect a direct response to the reduced AJ levels that appeared to emanate from the perturbed inner bulge:stem cell interface . Thus it was surprising that immune suppression kept the ectopic proliferation of telogen HF stem cells largely in check . These findings expose an additional layer of complexity in the proliferative control of HF stem cells not seen in the invertebrate stem cell systems studied to date . Previous reports have described immune , hyperproliferative responses of mammalian epithelial tissues following genetic perturbations in various AJ components ( Perez-Moreno et al . , 2006; Vasioukhin et al . , 2001 ) . However , the responses documented occur directly at the level of genetic alterations and are thus largely cell-autonomous . The specific roles for \u03b1-catenin and p120-catenin in signaling also appear to be independent of barrier function . Notably , as we have shown here , the stem cells displaying a hyperproliferative response can themselves be wild-type and depend upon their border with damaged niche neighbors to trigger the subsequent cascade of events we identified . Despite the critical role that the immune response plays to induce stem cell proliferation , the telogen-phase stem cells within the damaged niche still maintained in part a transcriptome reflective of cell proliferation even when the immune response was repressed . This aspect of their transcriptome paralleled that of their natural proliferative state in the hair cycle . However , in early anagen , the levels of hair cycle stimulatory factors outweigh the quiescence factors emanating from the bulge niche . By contrast , within a damaged telogen-phase niche , the quiescence factors still remained high , and in the absence of anagen-stimulating factors , the reduction in AJs and elevation in cell cycle transcriptome were not sufficient on their own to activate these stem cells . In this way , the proliferative trigger for repurposing the stem cells became contingent upon the unleashing of immune distress signals upon the failure of their niche neighbors to provide a proper barrier . Our studies exposed a fascinating interplay between the terminally differentiated cells that provide the niche barrier , and its neighboring stem cells that fuel regenerative processes in hair cycling and wound repair . Through their ability to respond to their damaged niche , stem cells are able to alter their program of gene expression in a way that both primes the stem cells for proliferation and enables them to recruit immune cells . In turn , the immune cells bestow new keratinocyte growth factors and cytokines on the local niche microenvironment . The strong presence of Tregs may also enable stem cell niches to limit tissue damage that might otherwise be caused by massive inflammation . Our findings suggest that through their elevated cell cycle transcriptome , the primed stem cells within the damaged niche have a reduced threshold for proliferation and therefore selectively respond to recruited immune cells , even though normal homeostatic quiescent controls are still sufficient to keep other nearby cells ( e . g . the hair germ ) in check . This selective self-renewal behavior by stem cells sustains the immune response and also reinforces the damaged barrier with layers of cells whose intercellular junctions are intact . Our findings explain a number of pathological conditions involving perturbations in terminally differentiating cells that are manifested in healthy stem/progenitor cells . \n Cdh3null , Cdh1Flox , Rosa26lox-STOP-lox-YFP , Sox9-CreER , Krt15-CrePGR and Krt14-rtTA were described previously ( Boussadia et al . , 2002; Mao et al . , 1999; Morris et al . , 2004; Nguyen et al . , 2006; Radice et al . , 1997; Soeda et al . , 2010 ) . Sox9-CreER was activated by tamoxifen ( Sigma ) administered either by intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) injection ( 75 \u03bcg/g body weight in corn oil ) once a day for 3 days or by single topical application ( 1 . 5 mg in ethanol ) on hair coat of mice . Krt15-CrePGR was activated by mifepristone ( RU486 , TCI America ) administered by i . p . injection ( 75 \u03bcg/g body weight in sesame oil ) and topically ( 12 mg in ethanol ) on shaved dorsal back of mice once a day for 7 days . Antibiotics treatment was performed by feeding mice with chow containing 0 . 025% trimethoprim and 0 . 1242% sulfamethoxazole; feeding with antibiotics water containing metronidazole ( 500 mg/L , Sigma ) , sulfamethoxazole ( 400 mg/L , Sigma ) , trimethoprim ( 100 mg/L , Sigma ) and cephalexin ( 500 mg/L , Sigma ) with Splenda sweetener to improve the taste of the water; and i . p . injection of vancomycin ( 0 . 75 mg , Sigma ) and metronidazole ( 0 . 75 mg , Sigma ) daily . Sox9CreER mice were treated with antibiotics starting one week post-tamoxifen until time of harvest . Immunosuppression was achieved by daily i . p . injections of dexamethasone at 1 mg/kg body weight . rtTA was activated by feeding mice with doxycycline ( 2 mg/kg ) chow . To track hair cycles ( M\u00fcller-R\u00f6ver et al . , 2001 ) , full-length telogen hairs were trimmed with electric clippers to reveal dorsal skin . HF entry into anagen was determined by darkening of skin and reappearance of hair . Completion of anagen and re-entry into telogen were determined by appearance of full-length hairs and loss of pigmentation in skin . EdU ( 5-ethynyl-2\u2019-deoxyuridine; Thermo Fisher , 25 \u03bcg/g body weight ) was injected i . p . into mice twice a day before obtaining skin biopsies or lethal administration of CO2 . All mice were maintained in a facility approved by The Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care ( AAALAC ) , and procedures were performed with protocols approved by Rockefeller University\u2019s institutional animal care and use committee ( IACUC ) members . Cdh1-shRNA was obtained from the Broad Institute\u2019s Mission TRC-1/2 mouse library and cloned into LV-pLKO-PGK-H2B-RFP vector ( Moffat et al . , 2006 ) . Cdh1-shRNA sequence is CCGAGAGAGTTACCCTACATA . For myc-tagged PCAD overexpression , Cdh3 coding DNA sequence ( CDS ) containing myc tag sequence inserted after its pro-peptide sequence was synthesized and cloned into LV-TRE vector . To tag PCAD with myc at the C-terminal end , Cdh3 CDS was amplified with myc inserted before its STOP codon , then cloned into LV-TRE vector . LV production , concentration and ultrasound-guided transduction of mouse embryos in utero were performed as described previously ( Beronja et al . , 2010 ) . To prepare sagittal skin sections for immunofluorescence microscopy , backskins were either freshly embedded and frozen in OCT , or pre-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C then treated with 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C prior to embedding and freezing in OCT . Backskins were cryosectioned ( 12 \u03bcm ) and sections from freshly embedded tissues were fixed for 10 min in 4% PFA . To prepare whole-mounts for immunofluorescence microscopy , subcutaneous fat was scraped from backskins , which were then incubated ( dermis side down ) on 2 . 5 U/ml dispase\u00a0+20 mM EDTA for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C . Epidermis and HFs were separated from dermis , fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min at room temperature ( RT ) and permeabilized for 30 min in PBS\u00a0+\u00a00 . 5% Triton ( PBST ) . Sections and whole-mounts were blocked for 1\u20132 hr at RT in 2% fish gelatin , 5% donkey serum , 1% BSA and 0 . 2% Triton in PBS . Primary antibody incubation was performed overnight at 4\u00b0C . Incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to rhodamine red-X , Alexa 488 , 546 or 647 was performed for 1\u20132 hr at RT . Mouse antibodies were incubated with M . O . M . block according to manufacturer\u2019s directions ( Vector Laboratories ) . Images were acquired with Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 equipped with ApoTome . 2 through a 20x air objective or Zeiss LSM780 laser-scanning confocal microscope through a 40x water objective . To prepare sagittal skin sections for hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry , backskin was fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C . Subsequent dehydration , paraffin embedding , sectioning and staining were performed by Histowiz Inc . Stained slides were scanned at 40x magnification using Aperio AT2 and visualized using Aperio Image Scope software . Modified Gram staining method has been described by ( Becerra et al . , 2016 ) . Briefly , paraffin sections were applied , in the following order , with crystal violet , Gram iodine , Gram decolorizer and safranin ( Remel ) .

HF stem cells were FACS purified and co-cultured with feeder fibroblasts in 300 \u03bcM Ca2+ as described previously ( Nowak and Fuchs , 2009 ) . For growth curve assays , equal numbers of Cdh1 cKO and control HF stem cells were cultured in triplicates in the absence or presence of 10 nM dexamethasone , and cell numbers were counted every other day from Days 5 to 9 . For transwell migration assay , bone marrow-derived dendritic cells ( BMDCs ) or bone marrow-derived macrophages ( BMDM ) were obtained from femur and tibiae bone marrow of 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice and cultured in BMDC/macrophage medium ( RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine , 10% heat-inactivated FBS , 10 mM HEPES , and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin ) at a density of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells/ml with addition of 20 ng/ml recombinant murine GM-CSF ( R and D Systems ) and 10 ng/mL recombinant murine IL-4 ( R and D Systems ) for BMDC and 10 ng/ml recombinant murine M-CSF ( R and D Systems ) for BMDM derivation .

This process requires chemical signals called \u201cmorphogens\u201d that instruct the cells how to behave during development . The morphogens move across cells and tissues to form gradients of the signal . Cells then respond in different ways depending on how much of the signal they receive . This , in turn , depends on several factors: first , how quickly or slowly the signal moves; second , how well the morphogen binds to responding cells and other molecules in its path; and third , how much signal is lost or destroyed during the movement . Many researchers study morphogen gradients in the transparent zebrafish , since it grows quickly and it is easy to see developmental changes . However , until now it was not fully clear how the well-known morphogen called Nodal moves in live zebrafish as they develop . Wang , Wang et al . have now investigated how well Nodal signals bind to the surface of cells that receive the signal and to a molecule called \u201cLefty\u201d , which is present in the same path and interferes with Nodal signals . Advanced techniques called fluorescence correlation and cross-correlation spectroscopy were used to measure Nodal signals at the level of single molecules in growing zebrafish . The experiments gave insights into how far Nodal signals move and remain active . The results showed that , in addition to Nodal diffusing and binding to receiving cells , one of the most important factors determining how far and quickly Nodal moves is its inactivation and destruction . Lastly , Wang , Wang et al . built computational models to test their observations from live zebrafish . The current work was based on forcing zebrafish to produce molecules including Nodal at locations within the fish that normally do not make them . Therefore future experiments will aim to examine these molecules and their interactions when they are produced at their normal locations in the animal over time .", "source": "The correct distribution and activity of secreted signaling proteins called morphogens is required for many developmental processes . Nodal morphogens play critical roles in embryonic axis formation in many organisms . Models proposed to generate the Nodal gradient include diffusivity , ligand processing , and a temporal activation window . But how the Nodal morphogen gradient forms in vivo remains unclear . Here , we have measured in vivo for the first time , the binding affinity of Nodal ligands to their major cell surface receptor , Acvr2b , and to the Nodal inhibitor , Lefty , by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy . We examined the diffusion coefficient of Nodal ligands and Lefty inhibitors in live zebrafish embryos by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy . We also investigated the contribution of ligand degradation to the Nodal gradient . We show that ligand clearance via degradation shapes the Nodal gradient and correlates with its signaling range . By computational simulations of gradient formation , we demonstrate that diffusivity , extra-cellular interactions , and selective ligand destruction collectively shape the Nodal morphogen gradient . \n In many animals , development from a single cell to a complex multicellular organism requires the graded distribution and activity of diffusible proteins , which are known as morphogens . How morphogen gradients are formed is not fully understood . Studies in many organisms have suggested three major mechanisms to establish morphogen gradients: 1 ) diffusion , 2 ) transcytosis and 3 ) via cytonemes ( Green , 2002; M\u00fcller et al . , 2013; Rogers and Schier , 2011; Wartlick et al . , 2009 ) . For example , the gradient of fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) is established by diffusion and is regulated by extracellular heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( HSPGs ) ( Dowd et al . , 1999; Duchesne et al . , 2012; Makarenkova et al . , 2009; Miura et al . , 2009; Nowak et al . , 2011; Yu et al . , 2009 ) , whereas the gradient of Drosophila Decapentaplegic ( Dpp ) is established not only by diffusion , but also via transcytosis ( Dierick and Bejsovec , 1998; Kruse et al . , 2004 ) and cytonemes ( Hsiung et al . , 2005; Ramirez-Weber and Kornberg , 1999; Roy et al . , 2011 ) . Nodal proteins , which belong to the TGF-\u03b2 family of signaling proteins , play critical roles in vertebrate development ( Arnold and Robertson , 2009; Wakefield and Hill , 2013 ) . They serve as mesendoderm inducers in vertebrates , and are involved in many aspects of embryonic axis formation during development ( Kumari et al . , 2013; Sampath and Robertson , 2016 ) . Nodal proteins are translated as precursors and function as dimers ( Massagu\u00e9 , 1990 ) . The Nodal precursors are cleaved by extracellular convertases , and convertase processing was found to be essential for Nodal activation in zebrafish and mouse embryonic tissues ( Beck et al . , 2002; Le Good et al . , 2005 ) . A recent report found that FurinA convertase activity regulates long range signaling by the zebrafish left-right patterning Nodal , Southpaw ( Spaw ) , but not other Nodal factors ( Tessadori et al . , 2015 ) . Upon activation , Nodal proteins form complexes with type II and type I Activin receptors ( Acvr1b; Acvr2a/b ) , which are serine/threonine kinases ( Reissmann et al . , 2001; Yan et al . , 2002; Yeo and Whitman , 2001 ) and activate the Nodal pathway ( Jia et al . , 2008; Kumar , 2000; Massagu\u00e9 et al . , 2005; Whitman , 1998 ) . Nodal target genes include nodal itself and lefty , which encodes a feedback inhibitor of Nodal signaling ( Branford and Yost , 2002; Meno et al . , 1999 ) . In zebrafish , of the three nodal homologs , cyclops ( cyc ) , squint ( sqt ) and southpaw ( spaw ) , sqt and cyc are expressed in an overlapping pattern in the gastrula margin where presumptive mesoderm and endoderm cells are located ( Erter et al . , 1998; Feldman et al . , 1998; Gritsman et al . , 2000; Long et al . , 2003; Rebagliati et al . , 1998a; 1998b; Sampath et al . , 1998;\u00a0van Boxtel et al . , 2015 ) . However , Sqt and Cyc elicit differential responses in target cells: Sqt acts at long-range whereas Cyc only affects cells immediately adjacent to the source of the signal ( Chen and Schier , 2001; Jing et al . , 2006; M\u00fcller et al . , 2012; Tian et al . , 2008 ) . So far , there is no evidence for a requirement for transcytosis and cytonemes in distributing the Nodal factors and the Nodal morphogen gradient has been proposed to be established by simple diffusion ( Williams et al . , 2004 ) . The diffusion coefficient of a molecule is a measure of its ability to move freely across a defined region . The free diffusion coefficient of the zebrafish Nodals has been suggested to be faster than their effective diffusion coefficient ( M\u00fcller et al . , 2012; 2013 ) , resulting in fast diffusion over short distances but slow diffusion over longer distances presumably by morphogen trapping at high affinity binding sites . These observations led to the hypothesis that Nodal diffusion is hindered either by cell surface interactions or by molecules in the extracellular matrix ( M\u00fcller et al . , 2013 ) . How Nodal diffusion is hindered , and to what extent it shapes the Nodal gradient is unclear . In contrast to the differential diffusion model , a recent study suggested that a temporal signal activation window created by microRNA-430 ( miRNA-430 ) delays translation of the Nodal antagonist Lefty to determine the dimensions of Nodal signaling in the gastrula ( van Boxtel et al . , 2015 ) . Repression by miRNA-430 likely plays a key role in regulation of Nodal signaling . However , miRNA-430 is not exclusive to lefty1 but also targets nodal/sqt ( Choi et al . , 2007 ) . Moreover , reporter\u00a0protein expression and ribosome-profiling data from zebrafish embryos indicate that Nodal/Sqt and Lefty1 are translated in a similar temporal window in the early gastrula ( Choi et al . , 2007;\u00a0Bazzini et al . , 2012; Chew et al . , 2013 ) . As such , it is unclear how the proposed temporal activation window might be converted into a spatial Nodal gradient . Some studies have suggested that in addition to diffusion , the gradient of a morphogen is related to the rate of ligand clearance or stability ( Callejo et al . , 2006; Chamberlain et al . , 2008; Gregor et al . , 2007; Kicheva et al . , 2007; Wartlick et al . , 2009 ) , and a role for stability and clearance of Nodals in vivo\u00a0has been proposed ( Jing et al . , 2006; Le Good et al . , 2005; Tian and Meng , 2006 ) . Previously , we reported an atypical lysosome-targeting region located in the pro-domain of Cyc , which targets this Nodal protein for destruction , and regulates target gene induction ( Tian et al . , 2008 ) . How the lysosome-targeting region regulates Nodal clearance and how it influences the Nodal morphogen gradient was not known . In this study , we have examined the diffusion coefficient of Nodals in live zebrafish embryos by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) . FCS is a widely used single molecule sensitive technique that can quantitatively measure diffusion and concentrations in vivo by determining how fast particles diffuse through a fixed observation volume ( Shi et al . , 2009c; Yu et al . , 2009 ) . We estimated the affinity of Nodals to the type II receptor Acvr2b on the cell surface and to Lefty inhibitors in the extracellular space by single wavelength fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy ( SW-FCCS ) . SW-FCCS uses a single laser to excite proteins labeled with spectrally different fluorophores within the observation volume ( e . g . , the confocal volume ) ( Shi et al . , 2009a ) . By analyzing the correlated movement of various labeled proteins ( ligands/receptor/inhibitor ) , we determined the fraction of the proteins that were free or bound , and calculated the dissociation constants in live zebrafish embryos . We also investigated the contribution of ligand stability in forming the Nodal gradient . By analyzing diffusion and binding in vivo\u00a0and from computational simulations , we show that diffusivity alone is insufficient to generate the Nodal morphogen gradient . Our findings show that in order to generate and maintain a robust Nodal morphogen gradient , ligand clearance by degradation is balanced against the binding and release of Nodal ligands with the receptor and inhibitors . \n To visualize Nodal ligands in vivo , we fused the enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) with Sqt , Cyc , SqtCyc2 and Cyc\u03942 . The Cyc\u03942mutant , which lacks a lysosomal targeting region in the Cyc pro-domain , shows significantly increased stability and signaling range over wild type Cyc protein ( Tian et al . , 2008 and Figure 1 ) . SqtCyc2 chimeric protein harbors the atypical lysosome-targeting region from Cyc , and shows reduced stability and signaling range in comparison to Sqt ( Tian et al . , 2008 ) . We tested the activity of the fusion proteins by comparing nodal target gene induction by the various fusion proteins to that of their untagged counterparts , and found similar activity ( Figure 1A\u2013D and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13879 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13879 . 005 The diffusivity of extracellular signaling molecules can determine their distribution and activity range . To examine the diffusivity of the Nodal ligands , we determined the diffusion coefficients of Sqt- , Cyc- , Sqt Cyc2- and Cyc\u03942-EGFP fusion proteins in vivo using FCS . EGFP-tagged Nodal fusion proteins were expressed from a localized source and FCS measurements were acquired in the extracellular space at various distances from the source cells ( Figure 1 and Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . All the Nodal-GFP fusions , including Sqt , Cyc , SqtCyc2 and Cyc\u03942 , as well as Lefty1 and Lefty2 fusions show very similar diffusion coefficients ( Figure 1F ) . These results suggest that the free diffusivity alone is unlikely to differentiate the range and activity of the Nodal proteins . Cell surface receptors of extracellular signaling molecules can bind to the diffusible ligands , and thereby reduce their distribution range . In this scenario , the mobility of ligands that bind with higher affinity to the receptors will be more effectively retarded . To quantitate the binding affinity of Nodal ligands to the receptors , we determined the apparent dissociation constant ( Kd ) of Sqt and Cyc in vivo ( Foo et al . , 2012b ) with the predominant Nodal receptor Acvr2b , using FCCS . To uncouple binding from signaling events within the cytoplasm , we fused the extracellular and trans-membrane domains of Acvr2b lacking the intracellular kinase domain , to a red fluorescent protein , mCherry ( Figure 2A\u2013C ) . Sqt-EGFP , Cyc-EGFP or control secreted eGFP ( sec-EGFP ) fusion proteins were expressed from a localized source in embryos that uniformly expressed Acvr2b-mCherry , and correlation curves were obtained to infer the Kd . Surprisingly , the Kd of Sqt-Acvr2b is 65 \u00b1 7 nM and the Kd of Cyc-Acvr2b is 124 \u00b1 12 nM ( Figure 2D\u2013I ) . This result suggests Sqt binds with Acvr2b with an approximately twofold higher affinity compared to Cyc . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13879 . 006Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13879 . 006 The Nodal antagonist Lefty prevents Nodal proteins from binding to their receptors and has the potential to influence the distribution of Nodal ligands . To test if binding to the inhibitor affects Nodal ligand distribution , we determined the affinity of Sqt and Cyc to Lefty2 in vivo\u00a0by co-expressing Lefty-mCherry with Sqt-EGFP or Cyc-EGFP from a localized source and measuring the Kdin the extracellular space of embryonic blastula cells at various distances from the source ( Figure 3A\u2013C ) . The Kd of Sqt-Lefty2 is 29 \u00b1 1 . 2 nM and Cyc-Lefty2 Kd is 50 \u00b1 3 nM ( Figure 3D\u2013I ) , indicating an approximately twofold higher affinity of Sqt-Lefty2 binding in comparison to Cyc-Lefty2 binding . The differential affinity of the Nodals for Lefty could fine-tune their activity range by removing freely diffusing Nodals from the signaling pool . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13879 . 007Figure 3 .

Consistent with findings by M\u00fcller et al . , Sqt-EGFP was found to reach the edges of the blastula with no more than 50\u201360% loss in intensity , whereas the intensity of Cyc-EGFP fusion protein falls steeply from the source ( Figure 4B and Figure 4\u2014source data 1 ) . Interestingly , the gradient of the deletion mutant , Cyc\u03942-EGFP , which has a longer signaling range than Cyc-EGFP , was significantly shallower than that of Cyc , and the gradient of the SqtCyc2-EGFP chimera ( which has reduced signaling range compared to Sqt ) was steeper than that of Sqt-EGFP ( Figure 4B and Figure 4\u2014source data 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13879 . 008Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13879 . 010 To determine the relative stability of Sqt , Cyc , Cyc\u03942 and SqtCyc2 , we expressed FLAG-tagged versions of the proteins in HEK293T cells and examined the amount of secreted protein in the supernatant after various periods ( Figure 4C , D and S2 ) . By fitting the normalized band intensity acquired from immune-blots with an exponential decay model , we inferred the degradation rates ( 0 . 166 \u00d7 10\u22124 /s for Cyc-FLAG , 0 . 093 \u00d7 10\u22124 /s for Cyc\u03942-FLAG 0 . 090 \u00d7 10\u22124 /s for SqtCyc2-FLAG and 0 . 003 \u00d7 10\u22124 /s for Sqt-FLAG ) . The decay rate of these proteins shows a trend consistent with their gradient profile and their signaling range ( Figure 4A\u2013D , Figure 4\u2014source data 1 , Figure 1 and S2 ) . These results indicate a strong correlation between Nodal ligand stability and the gradient . To test the validity of our measurements , we performed simulations to model the Nodal gradient . Modeling of the Nodal morphogen gradient requires a range of different parameters , of which some have been measured in vivo and are available , and we have in this study determined binding affinities , and inferred concentrations ( Table 1 ) . We found the dissociation constants , KD , of Sqt and Cyc to their major cell surface receptor Acvr2 , to be ~60 and 120 nM , respectively . In addition , we determined the diffusion coefficients of the Nodals to be ~60 \u03bcm2/s . From the amplitude of our FCS measurements , we estimated the concentration of the Nodal factors to be on the order of 102 nM . We determined that the degradation rate for Cyc is higher than that for Sqt , confirming previous work ( Tian et al . , 2008; Jing et al . , 2006 ) . Nonetheless , because our degradation rate values were estimated from cell culture , in our simulations we use the values of 0 . 0001/s and 0 . 0005/s for Sqt and Cyc , respectively , documented in or estimated from previous reports ( Jing et al . , 2006; M\u00fcller et al . , 2012 ) . In the simulations we produced particles with 0 . 07/s to 0 . 7/s in the simulation volume ( corresponding to a production rate of 0 . 3\u20133 pM/s ) to obtain sufficient number of particles for statistical analysis . The number of particles at equilibrium is given by the ratio of production over degradation rate , which was 700\u20137000 for a degradation rate of 0 . 0001/s and 140\u20131400 for 0 . 0005/s . Importantly , the production rate itself does not change the gradient shape and only the gradient amplitude is altered . Therefore , the gradient shape is determined by the degradation rate and diffusion . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13879 . 011Table 1 .

This is referred to as tortuosity by M\u00fcller et al . ( 2013 ) and reduces diffusion maximally by a factor 2 ( M\u00fcller et al . , 2013 ) . In agreement with this , we determined that for cells with 10\u2009\u03bcm diameter and cell membrane-to cell membrane distance of 2\u2009\u03bcm , we obtain a reduction of diffusion by a factor 1 . 84 ( Figure 5D ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13879 . 012Figure 5 .

( D ) Comparison of the spread of the particles as a function of the distance from the source ( the left border in panels A\u2013C ) . The concentration curves were fit with a bell curve that describes the diffusion of particles from the source . For free diffusion ( A ) we recover a diffusion coefficient of D = 63 . 4 \u03bcm2/s close to the input value , and in the presence of cells ( B ) this reduces to an effective diffusion coefficient of Deff = 33 . 8 \u03bcm2/s , demonstrating the effect of tortuosity . ( E ) Simulations of diffusion in the presence of cells , and with different amounts of binding . The simulated diffusion coefficient was D = 60 \u03bcm2/s . The concentration curves were fit with Equation 8 .

( F ) Gradient formation using the effective diffusion coefficients determined from graph E and degradation rates of 0 . 0001/s and 0 . 0005/s , respectively . The blue curve represents Cyc , the red curve Sqt . Although Sqt has higher binding affinity and consequently a lower free mobile fraction , its lower degradation rate ensures that Sqt has a less steep gradient . The data was fit with an exponential function yielding gradients of 19 \u03bcm for Cyc and and 30 \u03bcm for Sqt , respectively .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13879 . 014 Secondly , we determined how binding affects the effective diffusion coefficient ( Figure 5C , E and Video 3 ) . For quantitative analysis , we simulated particles whose diffusion coefficient was recued from 60 to 30 \u03bcm2/s due to tortuosity and assumed that a fraction of the particles is bound to binding sites that are homogeneously distributed . The effective diffusion coefficient is reduced more for higher affinities , i . e . when more particles are bound on average . For instance , when 90 or 99% of particles are bound , morphogen diffusion is reduced by a factor 10 or 100 , respectively . The actual amount of bound ligand depends on the total concentration of ligand ( Lt ) , receptor ( Rt ) and the KD: ( 1 ) fbound=Kd+Lt+Rt2Lt\u2212 ( Kd+Lt+Rt ) 24Lt2\u2212RtLt Thirdly , for the simulations we assume that Sqt and Cyc share the receptors , and a ligand concentration of 100 nM is used for both Nodal ligands . The receptor concentration is on the order of 10\u2009\u03bcM or more ( see next paragraph ) , and is much higher than that of the ligands . As such , the exact ligand amount does not change the outcome significantly for ligand concentration changes within a factor of ~5 . The differences in the gradient length are therefore , a result of diffusion , differential binding of Sqt and Cyc , as well as different degradation rates . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13879 . 015Video 3 . Particle movement is hindered further by binding . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13879 . 015 Next , we determined the effective diffusion coefficient that results in a Sqt gradient length consistent with our measured values of about 30\u2009\u03bcm . The gradient length is described by a model previously used for Fgf8 diffusion in zebrafish embryos ( M\u00fcller et al . , 2013; Yu et al . , 2009 ) : ( 2 ) \u03bb=D/kR/Kd+1 where \u03bb is the gradient length , D is the free diffusion coefficient , k is the clearance rate which is assumed constant , R is the concentration of the receptor , and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant , respectively ( Table 1 ) . Using a gradient length of about 30\u2009\u03bcm and the other values as given in Table 1 , we estimate the effective diffusion coefficient to be on the order of 0 . 045 \u03bcm2/s . With a Kd of 60 nM for Sqt and an Lt of 100 nM , this requires a bound fraction fbound of 99 . 85% and a receptor concentration of ~40\u2009\u03bcM . The estimation of the receptor number of 40\u2009\u03bcM is based on the value of Deff required to establish the gradient of appropriate dimensions for Sqt . At this time it is not clear whether this concentration comprises only membrane receptors or whether additional binding sites ( e . g . , in interstitial spaces between cells ) contribute to it as shown for Fgf8 ( Yu et al . , 2009 ) . Any corrections in binding affinities for the receptor or different affinities for additional binding sites would alter the required concentration . Importantly , this number is dependent on the clearance/degradation rates that we have based upon previous reports , and which could change with more precise in vivo measurements . Based on the above , we assume that 40\u2009\u03bcM is the upper limit for the receptor concentration . At this receptor concentration , Cyc , with a Kd of 120 nM will have a bound fraction of 99 . 7% and an effective diffusion coefficient of 0 . 09 \u03bcm2/s . Finally , we used these effective diffusion coefficients and the degradation rates of 0 . 0001/s and 0 . 0005/s for Sqt and Cyc , respectively , to simulate gradient formation ( see simulation parameters in Table 1 ) . Using these parameters , Sqt produced a gradient of ~30\u2009\u03bcm length and Cyc gradient was ~19\u2009\u03bcm ( Figure 5F ) . These values are consistent with actual in vivo measurements ( Figure 4B and Figure 4\u2014source data 1 ) , and support our hypothesis . \n In our study , we found that the diffusion coefficients of free Nodal and Lefty proteins measured by FCS are very similar ( ~60 \u00b5m2/s ) , consistent with their similar apparent molecular weight and with previous reports ( M\u00fcller et al . , 2013 ) . However , their mobility is too great to account for the sharp gradients observed in developing embryos . The diffusion coefficient values determined by FCS are ~3 to 85 times higher than the effective diffusion coefficients reported using FRAP ( 18 . 9 \u00b1 3 . 0 \u00b5m2/s for Lefty2 , 3 . 2 \u00b1 0 . 5 \u00b5m2/s for Sqt and 0 . 7 \u00b1 0 . 2 \u00b5m2/s for Cyc ) ( M\u00fcller et al . , 2013 ) . FCS and FRAP produce different readouts because they measure diffusion in different contexts , time windows and scales . FCS determines diffusion within a small volume ( <1 \u00b5m3 ) and on a short timescale ( <1\u2009s ) , whereas FRAP measures net diffusion over a large area ( >1 , 000 \u00b5m3 ) over a longer time period ( >>10\u2009s ) . FCS has been very useful to determine local diffusion , to infer the concentration of molecules within a defined confocal volume , and to determine the affinity of molecular interactions within the defined confocal volume . FRAP has been very useful for examining large-scale movement of molecules in tissues . The diffusion coefficients determined by the two techniques are known to vary dramatically . For example , in Drosophila imaginal discs , the measured diffusion coefficient of Dpp-GFP is 10 \u00b1 1\u00a0\u00b5m2/s from FCS measurements ( Zhou et al . , 2012 ) , and 0 . 1 \u00b1 0 . 05\u00a0\u00b5m2/s by FRAP ( Kicheva et al . , 2007 ) . This difference is thought to arise from other factors ( e . g . , by degradation of the molecules during diffusion ) . Taken together , these findings strongly suggest there must be other molecules and mechanisms in the embryo that refine and shape the Nodal morphogen gradient . The diffusional movement of morphogens can also be altered by transient binding to other molecules such as receptors or to components of the extracellular matrix ( Baeg et al . , 2004; Belenkaya et al . , 2004; Han et al . , 2004; Lander et al . , 2002; Wang et al . , 2008; Yu et al . , 2009 ) , so that one possible mechanism to shape the gradient is transient binding of Nodal proteins to immobilized diffusion regulators , as found for the fibroblast growth factor Fgf8 ( Yu et al . , 2009 ) . To explain the long range distribution of Sqt compared to Cyc , it was also proposed that Sqt might have a lower binding affinity to its receptors , ( M\u00fcller et al . , 2012 ) . However , we find that Sqt in fact binds in vivo to Acvr2b with a higher affinity than the short-range Nodal , Cyc . Sqt also binds to Lefty with higher affinity , raising the possibility that Lefty-binding might alter Sqt activity . Another potential mechanism for gradient formation is rapid clearance of molecules during diffusion , as observed for Dpp in Drosophila ( Kicheva et al . , 2007 ) . Our measurements and calculations strongly support this mechanism . Previous studies have suggested that the Nodal gradient might be influenced by its stability: Le Good et al . showed that increasing the stability of mouse Nodal protein increases its range of activity ( Le Good et al . , 2005 ) ; Tian et al . found a lysozyme targeting signal in Cyc that accelerates its degradation and reduces the signaling activity of chimeric SqtCyc2 protein ( Tian et al . , 2008 ) ; Jing et al . determined the half-life of Sqt and Cyc to be ~8\u2009hr ( ~480 min ) and ~2\u2009hr ( ~120 min ) , respectively , which somewhat correlates with the difference in target induction by the two proteins ( Jing et al . , 2006 ) . However , the difference in clearance rates of Sqt , Cyc , Lefty1 and Lefty2 determined by photo-conversion assays is not pronounced enough to explain their very different decay lengths ( M\u00fcller et al . , 2012 ) . Interestingly , M\u00fcller et al . found that their fluorescent Cyc fusion protein was expressed at very low levels in the extracellular matrix , but exhibited an unusual punctate distribution close to the plasma membrane and in the cytosol , whereas their Sqt fusion showed a strong , uniform and mainly intracellular distribution . The punctate distribution of Cyc suggests that Cyc might undergo a much faster and/or sustained endocytosis process compared to Sqt . This supports our finding that cells selectively destroy Nodal ligands by recognizing the lysosome-targeting signal , since the ligands have to be internalized . Simulations of the Nodal gradient show that Sqt generates a gradient of 30\u2009\u03bcm and Cyc 19 . 1\u2009\u03bcm , consistent with our measurements of 29 . 5 \u00b1 5\u2009\u03bcm for Sqt and 19 . 7 \u00b1 2\u2009\u03bcm for Cyc ( from Figure 4B ) , as well as the estimated signaling range of these proteins ( Chen and Schier 2001; Tian et al . , 2008 ) . In the simulations , 80% and 95% of steady state levels for Cyc is achieved at 0 . 7 and 1 . 25\u2009hr , respectively , which is consistent with the timing of mesoderm induction in the gastrula . By the same predictions , Sqt reaches the 80% and 95% levels at ~4\u00a0hr and 7\u00a0hr , respectively , which is longer than expected . However , these simulations have not taken into consideration cell divisions or binding to other factors that could influence the gradient . Despite some differences in absolute values , the overall agreement between our experimental results , theory , and simulation supports our conclusion that the Nodal gradient is dependent upon diffusion , binding , and degradation of the morphogen . An important point to note from Equation ( 2 ) is that the clearance rate k and the receptor concentration R are inversely related to each other . Thus , a higher clearance rate would predict a lower receptor concentration and vice versa . It will be interesting to determine these values with higher accuracy in live zebrafish embryos . In addition , some aspects of the system have not been taken into account in our simulations . In particular , we found that Lefty binds the Nodals with high affinity . This may not influence gradient formation as the Sqt/Lefty and Cyc/Lefty complexes likely diffuse very similarly to Sqt and Cyc given that their size difference is within a factor of two . However , Lefty will influence Sqt and Cyc signaling when in complex , even if this is not directly evident in the gradient of fluorescent molecules . We also have not considered how the Nodal co-receptor ( Yan et al . , 1999 ) influences gradient formation . It will be interesting to determine how Oep/Cripto co-receptors and Lefty shape the active signaling gradient . The extracellular matrix ( ECM ) has been shown to play a key role in regulating diffusion of FGFs , presumably via interactions with heparan sulphate proteoglycans ( HSPGs ) ( Makarenkova et al . , 2009;\u00a0Yu et al . , 2009 ) . It is not known if the ECM or HSPGs play a role in modulating the Nodal morphogen gradient although sulfated proteoglycans have been proposed to provide directional cues for left-asymmetric Nodal in Xenopus ( Marjoram and Wright . , 2011 ) . In conclusion , we find that in addition to hindered diffusion via binding to the receptors and inhibitors , the differential stability of Nodal ligands play key roles in shaping the Nodal gradient and activity range . Our experimental findings together with theoretical and computational simulations show that diffusion , extracellular interactions i . e . , Nodal-receptor binding , Nodal-Lefty inhibitor binding , and selective ligand destruction collectively shape and refine the Nodal morphogen gradient . \n All the constructs were PCR amplified and cloned into pCS2+ vector with Kozak sequence gccacc immediate 5\u2019 of the start codon . For Cyc and Cyc\u03942 fusions , EGFP or 3xFLAG ( DYKDHDGDYKDHD-IDYKDDDDK ) tag was inserted 4 amino acids after the cleavage site ( RRGRR ) . For Sqt and SqtCyc2 fusions , EGFP or 3xFLAG tag was inserted 1 amino acid after the cleavage site ( RRHRR ) . For Lefty1 and Lefty2 fusions , EGFP or 3xFLAG tag was fused to the C-terminus of the protein as previously described ( M\u00fcller et al . , 2012 ) . For Acvr2b fusion , mCherry was fused to the C-terminus of Acvr2b ( 1\u2013188 aa ) . For generating the sec-EGFP construct , the EGFP tag was fused to the C-terminus of 4 amino acids after the cleavage site ( RRGRR ) of Sqt . For sec-EGFP-3xFLAG construct , 3xFLAG tag was fused to the C-terminus of Sec-EGFP ( Yu et al . , 2009 ) . Wild-type ( AB ) fish were maintained at 28 . 5\u00b0C and embryos were obtained from natural matings according to standard procedures and in accordance with institutional animal care regulations . The plasmids were linearized with NotI restriction endonuclease ( NEB ) and transcribed using the mMessage mMachine SP6 Kit ( Ambion ) to produce capped RNA . Synthetic RNA was purified with P-30 Bio-Spin columns ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation , and RNA concentration was quantified by Nanodrop ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) and estimation of agarose gel electrophoresis bands . To test overall inductivity of the various Nodal fusions , 5 ng of the RNA was mixed with 0 . 25% phenol red ( Sigma , Aldrich , St Louis , MO ) and injected into the yolk of 1-cell stage AB wild type embryos . To test the signaling range of the Nodal fusions , single cells of de-chorionated 128-cell stage embryos were injected with 2 . 5 pg RNA and 0 . 25% 10kDa biotin-Dextran ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Un-injected embryos from the same batch were used as controls and as reference for staging the embryos . Embryos were fixed at the 50% epiboly stage in 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS at 4\u00b0C for at least 24\u2009hr . The embryos were subjected to in situ hybridization to detect gsc and ntl expression levels as previously described ( Le Good et al . , 2005; M\u00fcller et al . , 2012; Tian et al . , 2008 ) . To generate clones of cells expressing Nodal or Lefty , Sqt , Cyc , Lefty1 or Lefty2 -EGFP RNA ( 2 . 5 pg ) was injected into single cells of 32\u2013128-cell stage embryos . To determine the dissociation constant of Nodal and Acvr2b , 50 pg RNA encoding Acvr2b-mCherry was injected into 1-cell stage embryos prior to clone generation . The embryos were mounted on glass-bottom dishes ( World Precision Instruments ) in 0 . 75% low melting temperature agarose ( in 30% Danieau\u2019s solution ) at the 30% epiboly stage for confocal imaging and FCS/FCCS measurements . HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding 3xFLAG tagged proteins using FuGene HD ( Promega , Madison , WI ) transfection reagent . The medium with transfection reagent was removed and replaced with fresh Opti-MEM medium ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) 24\u2009hr after addition of transfection reagent . Cell culture supernatants were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen 24\u2009hr after the removal of the transfection reagent . Small aliquots of frozen supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody ( Sigma ) and protein G dynabeads ( Life Technologies ) , and eluted with 3xFLAG peptide ( Sigma ) . The samples were immunobloted with the same antibody and the signals were detected with a Syngene PXi gel imaging system . The band intensity was quantified using ImageJ . To determine the clearance rate of the proteins , the remaining supernatant was diluted to the same concentration as supernatants from non-transfected cells , mixed with sec-EGFP-3xFLAG supernatant for input control , added to dishes with non-transfected cells and collected at different time points . Proteinase inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , Switzerland ) was added immediately after the supernatants were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen . The supernatants were enriched and detected as described above . The intensity of individual protein bands was normalized against EGFP to correct for differences in sample volume and immunoprecipitation , and normalized to time 0 for relative changes . A custom-built single wavelength fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy ( SW-FCCS ) system was used for the FCS and FCCS measurements as described ( Shi et al . , 2009a; 2009b ) . We obtained the correlation curve of the various fusion proteins by focusing the detection volume on the cell membrane at various distances from the source ( Figure 2A\u2013C ) . The correlation curves were analyzed and fitted with a bimolecular binding model to calculate the Kd . We co-expressed Lefty-mCherry with Sqt-EGFP or Cyc-EGFP from a localized source and measured the Kd\u00a0in the extracellular space of blastula cells at various distances from the source . The experimental raw auto-correlation data was fitted with defined correlation function models . In FCS , a one-component 3D diffusion model with triplet state was used for free diffusing molecules: ( 3 ) G3D , 1C , 1trip ( \u03c4 ) =1N[1+ ( Ftrip1\u2212Ftrip ) e\u2212\u03c4/\u03c4trip] ( 1+\u03c4\u03c4d ) \u22121[1+ ( \u03c90z0 ) 2\u03c4\u03c4d]\u22121/2+G\u221e , where N is the number of particles in the confocal volume; Ftrip is the fraction of the particles that have entered the triplet state; \u03c4trip is the triplet state relaxation time; \u03c4d is the average time required for one particle to diffuse through the confocal volume , \u03c90 and z0 are the radial and axial distances where the excitation intensity reaches 1/e2 of its value from the center of the confocal volume; and G\u221e is the convergence value of the ACF for long times . In FCCS , a one-component 2D diffusion model and a two-component 3D model were used for the membrane anchored receptors and Nodal ligands , respectively: ( 4 ) G2D , 1C , 1trip ( \u03c4 ) =1N[1+ ( Ftrip1\u2212Ftrip ) e\u2212\u03c4/\u03c4trip] ( 1+\u03c4\u03c4d ) \u22121+G\u221e ( 5 ) G3D , 2C , 1trip ( \u03c4 ) =1N[1+ ( Ftrip1\u2212Ftrip ) e\u2212\u03c4/\u03c4trip]{\u2211i\u2061Fi ( 1+\u03c4\u03c4di ) \u22121[1+ ( \u03c90z0 ) 2\u03c4\u03c4di]\u22121/2}+G\u221e where \u03c4di and Fi are the diffusion time and the amplitude of the ith component . The cross-correlation data was fitted by a one-component 2D model: ( 6 ) G3D , 1C , 1trip ( \u03c4 ) =1N ( 1+\u03c4\u03c4d ) \u22121+G\u221e Data was fit with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm using the described models in Igor Pro 6 . 0 ( WaveMetrics ) ( Wohland et al . , 2001 ) . The procedure of calibration and quantification of diffusion coefficient and dissociation constants were as previously described ( Foo et al . , 2012a; Shi et al . , 2009a ) . EGFP fusion proteins were excited with a 488 nm laser beam and the emitted fluorescence was collected through a 10X objective lens ( Olympus , UPLSAPO NA = 0 . 40 ) and a long-pass 505 emission filter with a 2 . 5X digital zoom . Images were acquired in planes ~15\u2009\u03bcm below the enveloping layer of the embryos at 512\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0512 pixels with a corresponding size of 1 . 4 \u03bcm2/pixel . Acquired images were analyzed using the ImageJ package . A rectangular region of interest ( ROI ) with a fixed height of 50 . 4\u2009\u03bcm ( 36 pixels ) adjacent to the source was drawn . The width of the ROI differed depending on the size of the embryo . Windows of 7 \u00d7 50 . 4 \u03bcm2 ( 5 \u00d7 36 pixels ) were binned and the average intensity of each binned window was calculated . Background auto-fluorescence was estimated from images of un-injected embryos and subtracted from all measurements . The data was normalized to the value closest to the source boundary , plotted on the intensity-distance coordinate with ImageJ . The data was pooled and fitted , or individual data sets were fitted and the gradient length was calculated as the mean of all fits . Both procedures yielded similar results . Fits were performed with an exponential decay: ( 7 ) C ( x ) =A\u2217exp[\u2212x\u03bb]+C where A is the amplitude of the gradient , \u03bb is the gradient decay length and C is a possible offset . Simulations were performed with Mathematica 10 . 0 ( Wolfram , Champaign , IL ) . Initial simulations to determine effective diffusion coefficients in the presence of cells as obstacles ( tortuosity ) and morphogen binding were conducted in 3D . For this purpose , we simulated a 3D slab of 2\u2009\u03bcm height ( z-axis ) , 44\u2009\u03bcm width ( y-axis ) , and 86 . 7\u2009\u03bcm length ( x-axis ) , for 5 s ( Figure 5A , B ) . We used a diffusion coefficient of D = 60 \u03bcm2/s , and created 1000 particles at the left border of the simulation volume . The particles were allowed to perform a random walk for 5 s with a time resolution of 5 ms per step . At the left and right borders ( along the x-axis ) , particles were reflected . At the other four borders we used periodic boundary conditions . Based upon actual measurements from early gastrula embryos , we assumed that the space is packed with cells of ~10\u2009\u03bcm diameter , and an intercellular space ( cell membrane-to-cell membrane distance ) of ~2\u2009\u03bcm . As the height of the simulation volume was only 2\u2009\u03bcm , we used cylinders to represent the cells within this space . Under these circumstances , ligand diffusion was reduced by a factor of 1 . 84 . This value is consistent with the findings of M\u00fcller et al . who reported tortuosity to reduce diffusion maximally by a factor of 2 ( M\u00fcller et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , for further modeling we assumed the effective diffusion coefficient of the Nodals to be ~30 \u03bcm2/s . In the case of binding we used the values in Table 1 and Equation 1 to determine the average number of free particles at each step . All concentration profiles were normalized and fitted by the following equation to determine the effective diffusion coefficient: ( 8 ) C ( x , t ) =exp[\u2212x24Defft] Here C ( x , t ) is the concentration profile , x is the coordinate along which the particle diffusion is observed , t is the time at which the profile is measured ( i . e . , 5 s ) , and Deff is the effective diffusion coefficient . Final simulations , including continuing particle production and degradation , used the values given in Table 1 and were run in 1D with an extent of 200\u2009\u03bcm , assuming a reduced diffusion coefficient of 30 \u03bcm2/s due to tortuosity , and an average number of particles bound as determined by Equation 1 . . To ensure that the gradients reached equilibrium , the simulation time was 16\u00a0hr 40\u2009min . The normalized concentration gradients C ( x ) were fitted with a simple exponential function to determine the gradient length \u03bb . ( 9 ) C ( x ) =exp[\u2212x\u03bb]"}

But too much blood sugar can be poisonous . The body regulates blood sugar balance using the hormone insulin , which triggers the removal of sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells . This removal process involves a pore in membranes at the surface of muscle and fat tissue , called a glucose transporter , through which the sugar molecules can pass . During fasting , the glucose transporter remains inside muscle and fat . But after a meal , insulin acts to release the transporter from its storage area to the surface of the tissue . How efficiently this process happens reflects how efficiently sugar can be removed from the blood . When this pathway breaks down , it can lead to diabetes . In humans , a protein called CHC22 is needed to deliver the glucose transporter to its storage area . In mice , CHC22 is absent . The question arises: do different animals' eating habits influence CHC22's role in controlling blood sugar ? The evolutionary history of CHC22 in a number of different animals could reveal what is special about glucose transport after a meal in humans , and how it might fail in diabetes . By analyzing the genomes of several different species , Fumagalli et al . found that the gene encoding CHC22 first evolved around the time animals began developing a backbone and complex nervous systems . Afterwards , it was lost by some animals \u2013 including mice , sheep and pigs . Fumagalli et al . also discovered that CHC22 varies between individual people . A new form of CHC22 , which first appeared in ancient humans , is less effective at holding the glucose transporter inside muscle and fat \u2013 leading to a tendency to reduce blood sugar levels . This new form became more common in humans over a period witnessing the introduction of cooking , and later farming; both of these technologies are associated with increased sugar in the diet . But not everyone has this new variant of the gene \u2013 both the old and newer variants are present in people today . The history of CHC22 suggests that it was useful for early humans to hold the glucose transporter inside muscle and fat , keeping blood sugar levels high , which contributed to the development of a large brain . But as humans became exposed to higher dietary levels of sugar the newer form of CHC22 allowed blood sugar to be lowered more readily . People with different forms of CHC22 are likely to differ in their ability to control blood sugar after a meal . In some cases , this could lead to heightened blood sugar levels , which in turn can lead to diabetes .", "source": "CHC22 clathrin plays a key role in intracellular membrane traffic of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 in humans . We performed population genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the CHC22-encoding CLTCL1 gene , revealing independent gene loss in at least two vertebrate lineages , after arising from gene duplication . All vertebrates retained the paralogous CLTC gene encoding CHC17 clathrin , which mediates endocytosis . For vertebrates retaining CLTCL1 , strong evidence for purifying selection supports CHC22 functionality . All human populations maintained two high frequency CLTCL1 allelic variants , encoding either methionine or valine at position 1316 . Functional studies indicated that CHC22-V1316 , which is more frequent in farming populations than in hunter-gatherers , has different cellular dynamics than M1316-CHC22 and is less effective at controlling GLUT4 membrane traffic , altering its insulin-regulated response . These analyses suggest that ancestral human dietary change influenced selection of allotypes that affect CHC22\u2019s role in metabolism and have potential to differentially influence the human insulin response . \n Clathrin-coated vesicles ( CCVs ) are key players in eukaryotic intracellular membrane traffic ( Brodsky , 2012 ) . Their characteristic lattice-like coat is self-assembled from cytoplasmic clathrin proteins , captures membrane-embedded protein cargo and deforms the membrane into a vesicle . This process enables CCVs to mediate protein transport to and from the plasma membrane and between organelles . The triskelion-shaped clathrin molecule is formed from three identical clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) subunits . Humans have two genes ( CLTC and CLTCL1 ) that respectively encode CHC17 and CHC22 clathrins ( Wakeham et al . , 2005 ) . CHC17 clathrin , which has three bound clathrin light chain ( CLC ) subunits , is expressed uniformly in all tissues and forms CCVs that control receptor-mediated endocytosis , as well as lysosome biogenesis and maturation of regulated secretory granules . These pathways are conventionally associated with clathrin function and are mediated by clathrin in all eukaryotic cells ( Brodsky , 2012 ) . In humans CHC22 clathrin is most highly expressed in muscle and adipose tissue and forms separate CCVs that are not involved in endocytosis ( Dannhauser et al . , 2017 ) . In these tissues , CHC22 CCVs regulate targeting of the glucose transporter 4 ( GLUT4 ) to an intracellular compartment where it is sequestered until released to the cell surface in response to insulin ( Vassilopoulos et al . , 2009 ) . This insulin-responsive GLUT4 pathway is the dominant mechanism in humans for clearing blood glucose into muscle and fat tissues after a meal ( Shepherd and Kahn , 1999 ) . In addition to its distinct tissue expression pattern and biological function , CHC22 does not bind the CLC subunits that associate with CHC17 clathrin , even though the CHC protein sequences are 85% identical ( Dannhauser et al . , 2017; Liu et al . , 2001 ) . This remarkable biochemical and functional divergence evolved since the gene duplication event that gave rise to the two different clathrins during the emergence of chordates ( Wakeham et al . , 2005 ) . Notably , however , the CLTCL1 gene encoding CHC22 evolved into a pseudogene in the Mus genus , although mice maintain an insulin-responsive GLUT4 pathway for clearing blood glucose . This observation suggests that , despite the importance of the CLTCL1 gene product , backup pathways have evolved to compensate for loss of the CHC22 protein . To understand the evolution of the specialized function of CHC22 , and the potential selective processes involved , we here explore the phylogenetic history of the CLTCL1 gene in vertebrates and its population genetics in humans , non-human primates and bears . Ecological shifts create selective forces that filter variation in cellular genes . These include changes in nutritional conditions ( Babbitt et al . , 2011 ) , as well as encounters with pathogens ( Fumagalli et al . , 2011 ) ; both documented as selective forces that affect membrane traffic genes ( Elde and Malik , 2009; Liu et al . , 2014 ) . Recent studies of the evolution of genes involved in membrane traffic have focused on an overview of all eukaryotes with the goals of establishing the origins of membrane-traffic regulating proteins in the last common eukaryotic ancestor and defining the species distribution of various families of traffic-regulating proteins ( Rout and Field , 2017; Dacks and Robinson , 2017 ) . These studies have identified common features of proteins that regulate membrane traffic ( Rout and Field , 2017 ) and revealed that extensive gene duplication has allowed lineage-specific diversification of coat proteins and other membrane traffic regulators , such as the Rab GTPases ( Diekmann et al . , 2011; Guerrier et al . , 2017 ) . Our earlier study of available annotated genomes in 2005 suggested that the gene duplication giving rise to the two CHC-encoding genes occurred as a result of one of the whole genome duplications contributing to vertebrate evolution ( Wakeham et al . , 2005 ) . Here we focus on the more recent evolutionary history of these genes , as well as analyze the increased number of fully annotated vertebrate genomes . We establish that the loss of CLTCL1 in the Mus genus is not unique in vertebrates , identifying at least one additional independent gene loss event in the clade of Cetartiodactyla affecting pigs , cows , sheep , porpoise , and possibly additional related species . Nonetheless , there is strong evidence for CHC22 sequence conservation amongst those species that retain CLTCL1 ( Wakeham et al . , 2005 ) . This evolutionarily recent gene loss in some lineages and retention of the functional form in others suggested that CLTCL1 may still be under purifying selection , so we examined CLTCL1 variation between individuals within vertebrate populations . Comparing populations , we found CLTCL1 to be considerably more polymorphic than CLTC , which encodes the clathrin found in all eukaryotes , with evidence for strong ancient purifying selection for CHC17 clathrin function and relaxed purifying selection on CHC22 function . Additionally , we identified two common allotypes of human CHC22 , which have different functional properties . The derived allele arose in ancient humans and is more frequent in farming populations when compared to hunter-gatherers . We previously observed that CHC22 accumulates at sites of GLUT4 retention in the muscle of insulin-resistant patients with type two diabetes ( Vassilopoulos et al . , 2009 ) in addition to its active role in membrane traffic of GLUT4 . Thus , CHC22 variation has potential to differentially affect membrane traffic pathways involved in insulin resistance , as well as alter normal glucose metabolism within human and other vertebrate populations . The analyses reported here lead us to propose that variation in the CHC22 clathrin coat may be a response to changing nutritional pressures both between and within vertebrate species . \n Identification of CHC-encoding genes in 62 vertebrate and non-vertebrate species ( ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) indicates a dynamic history of gene duplications and losses ( Figure 1 ) . The CLTCL1 gene was detected only in jawed vertebrates ( bony vertebrates and cartilaginous fish ) , while the two jawless vertebrate genomes available \u2013 lamprey ( Petromyzon marinus ) and hagfish ( Eptatretus burgeri ) \u2013 have only one CHC-encoding gene . This distribution refines the timing of the CHC-encoding gene duplication to the period after the Agnatha split off the vertebrate lineage , estimated at 493 . 8MYA ( 95% HPD: 459 . 3 , 533 . 8 ) , and before the evolution of jawed vertebrates 450 . 8MYA ( 95% HPD: 432 . 1 , 468 . 1 ) ( Hedges et al . , 2015; dos Reis et al . , 2015 ) . Of the ten species of bony fish that split off the spotted gar ( Lepisosteus oculatus ) lineage ( Amores et al . , 2011 ) , whose genomes are generally tetraploid , all had two versions of CLTC and at least one CLTCL1 gene , except for cave fish ( Astyanax mexicanus ) apparently lacking CLTCL1 . Eight additional species of vertebrates with high genome coverage and reliable annotation had the CLTC gene but no identifiable CLTCL1 gene . CLTCL1 genes are present in the Caviomorpha and Sciuridae rodent suborders , and lost in the Muroidea suborder from the entire Mus genus ( Wakeham et al . , 2005 ) and from rat ( Rattus norvegicus ) . The Cetartiodactyla clade also appears to have lost CLTCL1 , as CLTCL1 is absent from the four representative genomes in our dataset ( pig ( Sus scrofa ) , sheep ( Ovis aries ) , cow ( Bos taurus ) , Yangtze finless porpoise ( Neophocaena asiaeorientalis ) ) . This suggests a loss event before the Cetartiodactyla lineage split , independent of the loss event preceding split of the Muroidea lineage . The absence of CLTCL1 in rat clarifies why CHC22 could not be biochemically identified in rat and indicates that antibodies against CHC22 that react with rat cells must cross-react with other proteins ( Towler et al . , 2004 ) . CLTCL1 was also not detected in the genomes of the little brown bat ( Myotis lucifugus ) and the duck-billed platypus ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus ) . Assuming the genome annotations for the species analyzed are reliable , these data indicate that there have been at least five independent losses of CLTCL1 that are clade- or species-specific . The intermittent loss of CLTCL1 and the retention of CLTC raises the question of whether their patterns of evolution are typical for genes with related functions that duplicated in the same time frame as CLTC/CLTCL1 . CLTC and CLTCL1 are located on paralogous regions of human chromosomes 17 and 22 , respectively . For these two genes , the evolutionary rates ( rate of non-synonymous substitutions to rate of synonymous substitutions; dN/dS ) across vertebrates at each position were determined and plotted along the length of the protein sequences ( Figure 2A\u2013B ) . Several adjacent paralogs have been maintained in these chromosomal regions , some of which are involved in membrane traffic , including the gene pair of MTMR4 and MTMR3 , encoding myotubularin lipid phosphatases . Also , CLC subunits of CHC17 clathrin are encoded by paralogous genes on different chromosomes ( CLTA and CLTB ) that arose from a local gene duplication , mapped to the same time frame as the CHC-encoding duplication ( Wakeham et al . , 2005 ) . Comparison of the distribution of dN/dS ratios for the three pairs revealed stronger purifying selection on the CLTC/CLTCL1 genes than on MTMR4/MTMR3 and CLTA/CLTB ( Figure 2C\u2013E ) , suggesting the CHC-encoding clade is more evolutionarily constrained . This observation is consistent with our previous identification of conserved signature residues in CLTCL1 using DIVERGE analysis ( Wakeham et al . , 2005 ) and indicates conserved functions for both the CLTC and CLTCL1 gene products . Furthermore , there is a striking difference in the distribution and average of evolutionary rates , as measured by dN/dS , between CLTC and CLTCL1 ( Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value<2 . 2e-16 ) , with CLTC being significantly more constrained by purifying selection than CLTCL1 . In contrast , there is minimal difference in the distribution and average of evolutionary rates between the two paralog pairs MTMR4/MTMR3 and CLTA/CLTB ( Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields p-values 0 . 003643 and 0 . 9959 , respectively ) . To follow up the indication that CLTC and CLTCL1 are subject to different degrees of purifying selection , we investigated their variation in human populations . We analyzed 2504 genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project database , phase 3 ( 1000 Auton et al . , 2015 ) and identified alleles resulting from non-synonymous substitutions for CLTC and CLTCL1 . This dataset included individuals from each of five human meta-populations: European ( EUR , 503 ) , East Asian ( EAS , 504 ) , Admixed American ( AMR , 347 ) , South Asian ( SAS , 489 ) and African ( AFR , 661 ) . Individual populations with their abbreviations are listed in Supplementary file 1a . The reference sequences for chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) and pseudo-references for two archaic humans , Altai Neanderthal and Denisovan , were also included to relate allelic variation to the ancestral state . A median-joining network for all the inferred CLTC human alleles showed a very common allele ( sample frequency 0 . 997 ) with only five low-frequency variants generating a total of six alleles ( Figure 3A ) . Each allele encodes a variant of a CHC ( allotype ) , which includes one or more single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) . In contrast to CLTC , we identified 46 non-synonymous SNPs in CLTCL1 , present in 52 distinct haplotypes ( referred to here as alleles , following the definition given above , Supplementary file 2b-c ) . A median-joining network for the most common CLTCL1 alleles showed that they are widely distributed within the human meta-populations ( Figure 3B ) . Each meta-population tends to have private , less frequent alleles . Nevertheless , all the meta-populations comprised two main allelic clades , together constituting a sample frequency of 77% . These two main alleles differ by a single methionine to valine substitution at position 1316 ( M1316V ) in the protein sequence ( SNP ID rs1061325 with genomic location chr22:19184095 on hg19 assembly ) . The valine at position 1316 is predicted to have a functional effect on the protein since it was categorized as \u2018probably damaging\u2019 with a probability of 0 . 975 by PolyPhen ( Adzhubei et al . , 2010 ) and as \u2018damaging\u2019 by SIFT ( Kumar et al . , 2009 ) . Sequences in chimpanzee and archaic humans have the M1316 allotype , suggesting that M1316 is likely to represent the ancestral state . To further investigate this , we inspected raw sequencing data from both Altai Neanderthal and Denisovan ( Supplementary file 1d ) . We inferred the most likely genotype to be homozygous for the M1316 amino acid ( minimum sequencing depths equal to 40 and 28 , respectively ) . We then extracted sequencing data for an additional 13 archaic and ancient humans ( Supplementary file 1d ) . We found that the V1316 amino acid is present in Pleistocene hunter-gatherers and Neolithic farmers but not in other Neanderthals or Holocene hunter-gatherers in this limited data set . The equivalent residue in human CHC17 ( encoded by CLTC ) is also methionine , suggesting that methionine at this position likely pre-dated the initial duplication generating CLTCL1 . For the non-human species analyzed ( Figure 1 ) , all CHC-encoding genes present would produce clathrins with M1316 , further indicating its ancient and conserved role in CHC structure or function . To quantify the levels of nucleotide and allelic diversity for non-synonymous sites within human populations , several summary statistics of diversity were calculated . For populations within each meta-population , we separately calculated Watterson\u2019s and Nei\u2019s estimators of genetic diversity ( TW and PI , respectively ) , Tajima\u2019s D ( TD ) , Fu and Li\u2019s D* ( FLDs ) and F* ( FLFs ) , the sum of squared allele frequencies including the most common allele ( H1 ) and excluding it ( H2 ) , and the normalized ratio between H2 and H1 ( H2H1 ) ( Supplementary file 2a ) . To assess whether observed summary statistics are expected or not under neutral evolution in each population , we calculated the empirical null distribution from a set of 500 control genes with the same coding length as CLTCL1 ( Supplementary file 2b ) . High or low percentile rank values for CLTCL1 in the empirical distribution indicate that the summary statistic for CLTCL1 is unlikely to occur by mutation and neutral genetic drift alone . Summary statistics and populations were then clustered according to their empirical ranks and plotted on a heat map ( Figure 4 ) . All populations tend to display high genetic diversity for CLTCL1 , as summarized by PI and TW , and an unusually high frequency for the second most common allele , as summarized by H2 and H2H1 . Such configuration is likely to occur under balancing selection ( Charlesworth , 2006 ) or because of a soft sweep ( Messer and Petrov , 2013 ) . That CLTCL1 was low ranking in all populations for H1 , a statistic representing the frequency of the most common allele , also supported diversifying selection rather than hard sweeps . On the other hand , all populations display negative TD values with many populations exhibiting negative FLDs and FLFs values . These values are consistent with low diversity within common alleles and an excess of low-frequency variants . Finally , we calculated a measure of genetic differentiation ( fixation index FST ) between pairs of canonical reference populations , namely Yoruba from Nigeria ( YRI ) , North Americans with European ancestry ( CEU ) , and Han Chinese from Beijing ( CHB ) . We did not find any evidence that FST values for CLTCL1 ( YRI-CEU 0 . 15 , YRI-CHB 0 . 077 , CEU-CHB 0 . 065 ) are outliers in the empirical distribution of control genes . Such inconsistent patterns could be partly explained by the fact that we considered only non-synonymous changes , and the limited number of SNPs considered per gene may create a larger variance in the empirical distributions , especially for allele-based statistics . We therefore further examined the high frequency of the second most common allele by investigating whole genomic variation , including silent SNPs . We observed a local increase of H2 statistics in CLTCL1 for European populations , which already shows a large value based on non-synonymous changes ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This analysis also indicates that any selection signatures are restricted to a local genomic region encompassing CLTCL1 . Another reason for the summary statistics not being strong outliers in the empirical distribution is the high recombination rate ( sex-average rate of 2 . 5 cM/Mb ) inferred for the genomic region encompassing CLTCL1 ( Kong et al . , 2002 ) . We therefore performed coalescent simulations under neutrality of a putative 100kbp genomic region surrounding the SNP encoding the M1316V variation , taking into account the local recombination rate and a previously proposed demographic model for Africans ( YRI ) , Europeans ( CEU ) and East Asians ( CHB ) ( Gutenkunst et al . , 2009 ) with a mutation rate of 1 . 5 \u00d7 10\u22128 per base pair per generation . The observed values for TW and PI were significantly greater than expected under neutral evolution for all populations ( p-values<0 . 001 ) , while TD was greater than expected for CHB only , although with a marginally non-significant statistical support ( p-value 0 . 056 ) . All these results are suggestive of a genetic diversity higher than expected under neutrality for a region encompassing M1316V , although possible complex evolutionary scenarios may limit the power of summary statistics to detect such selective events . One plausible explanation of the high genetic diversity and frequency of the two major alleles of CLTCL1 that occur in all modern human populations ( Figure 3B , Supplementary file 1b ) is balancing selection ( Charlesworth , 2006 ) . Such a distribution of allele frequency was confirmed using a different data set of more than 50 sampled human populations ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . In several populations , we also observed an apparent excess of heterozygosity at SNP rs1061325 ( Supplementary file 2c ) , compatible with heterozygote advantage ( overdominance ) for the two encoded allotypes differing at residue 1316 . Specifically , all European populations show a ratio of observed versus expected ( assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ) heterozygosity greater than 1 , with the highest value of 1 . 24 ( chi-squared test nominal p-value 0 . 047 ) for Iberic Spanish ( IBS ) ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Selective pressures that might be acting on CLTCL1 , irrespective of population distribution , could be changes in human diet , a number of which have been inferred over the last 2 . 6 million years ( Hardy et al . , 2015 ) . Perhaps the best known of these dietary transitions are the introduction of cooking\u00a0~450 KYA , the\u00a0development of farming\u00a0~12 , 500 YA , and more recently industrialized food processing , which gradually and then dramatically increased carbohydrate availability and consumption by humans . As CHC22 clathrin , the gene product of CLTCL1 , is required for formation of the intracellular pathway critical for an insulin response , its genetic history could potentially be influenced by these changes . To address the hypothesis that nutritional habits conferred selective pressure on CLTCL1 , we compared the frequency of SNP rs1061325 ( M1316V ) in farming versus hunter-gatherer population samples from ancient and modern humans . Although the appearance of SNP rs1061325 predates the advent of farming ( Supplementary file 1d ) , the observed frequencies of this allele , which encodes the CHC22-V1316 allotype , are consistent with a tendency for it to increase once farming became common practice for a population ( Figure 5 ) , although the\u00a0small sample size for modern humans limits the power to reach statistical significance . The highest difference in allele frequency was observed between early farmers and hunter-gatherers from West Eurasia . However , as these two populations are highly diverged , it remains possible that this significant difference in allele frequency is due to genetic drift shaped by population history , rather than natural selection . To test this model , using the same dataset , we extracted 2500 control SNPs with a global minor allele frequency similar to rs1061325 ( M1316V ) ( up to an error of 5% ) and minimum global sequencing depth of 100X . We obtained statistical significance ( p-value 0 . 036 ) when testing the difference in derived allele frequency in farmers compared to hunter-gatherers ( +26 . 58% ) , while we found no statistical support ( p-value 0 . 080 ) when testing the absolute difference in allele frequency between these two populations . We analyzed allelic variation for CLTC and CLTCL1 in the genomes of 79 individuals representing six species of great ape , two species each for chimpanzees , gorillas and orangutans ( Pan troglodytes , Pan paniscus , Gorilla beringei , Gorilla gorilla , Pongo abellii , Pongo pygmaeus ) . After data filtering and haplotype phasing , we found no non-synonymous SNPs for CLTC and 64 putative non-synonymous SNPs for CLTCL1 ( Supplementary file 3a ) . In three species of great apes analyzed , one of the non-synonymous changes in CLTCL1 leads to a premature stop-codon at amino position 41 , with an overall frequency of 36% . However , sequences containing the stop-codon exhibited only a marginal increase of nucleotide diversity ( +4 . 7% as measured by Watterson\u2019s index; Watterson , 1975 ) compared to the full-length sequences , suggesting that these are relatively new variants . Notably , for all the non-human primates analyzed , CLTCL1 variants do not encode the V1316 allotype , which appears private to humans . However , in all three types of great ape we found a common but different substitution , threonine ( T1316 ) , at the same amino acid position . To further investigate variation in non-human primates , we increased the sample size per species by analyzing CLTC and CLTCL1 variation in 70 chimpanzee and bonobo genomes , including four subspecies of chimpanzee . While no variation was observed for CLTC ( Figure 3C ) , a median-joining network for the inferred 8 CLTCL1 alleles ( Supplementary file 3b ) showed a major allele common to different species and subspecies with less frequent alleles primarily restricted to individual ones ( Figure 3D ) . In this chimpanzee data set , we observed considerable diversity , with a potential tendency towards multiple variants . However , amino acid 1316 was not covered in this data set , possibly due to poor data mapping quality associated with the high nucleotide diversity observed . In another data set of 20 individuals ( Teixeira et al . , 2015 ) , we found a frequency of 10% for the T1316 allotype in chimpanzees but not in bonobos . We further investigated CLTCL1 variation in polar bears ( Ursus maritimus ) and their closest related species , brown bears ( Ursus arctos ) . These two species , which diverged 479\u2013343 KYA ( Liu et al . , 2014 ) , have very different diets ( Liu et al . , 2014; Bojarska and Selva , 2012 ) and are phylogenetically closer to each other than chimpanzees and humans . Polar bears subsist on a high fat , low carbohydrate diet , whereas brown bears consume a more varied diet of carbohydrate , protein and fat . Analysis of 21 bear genomes ( seven polar bears and 14 brown bears ) ( Benazzo et al . , 2017 ) , revealed three positions ( 1267 , 1389 , and 1522 ) which are fixed in polar bears but are either polymorphic or have a different residue in brown bears ( Supplementary file 3c ) . Genetic differentiation between polar and brown bears , as measured by FST , is markedly higher for CLTCL1 ( 0 . 56 ) than for CLTC ( 0 . 26 ) ( Liu et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , a phylogenetic tree of both bear species in our sample exhibits more diversification for CLTCL1 compared to CLTC ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This sample of bear populations may support the emergence of multiple CLTCL1 variants within a species and a potential role for diet-related selection . One expectation for selection of the human-specific CLTCL1 allele encoding the CHC22-V1316 allotype is that this amino acid change might confer a functional change in the clathrin lattice . This was predicted by the PolyPhen and SIFT analyses , highlighting the change as potentially structure-altering . As many humans are heterozygous for the M1316 and V1316 allotypes ( 44% based on all individuals from 1000 Genomes project ) , there may potentially be special properties for mixed lattices formed from the two protein allotypes . To address the possibility that the M1316V polymorphism affects protein function , we used MODELLER ( Benjamin and Sali , 2014 ) to produce a homology model of the two CHC22 allotypes based on the crystal structure of CHC17 clathrin ( PDB 1B89 ) ( Ybe et al . , 1999 ) , taking advantage of the 85% protein sequence identity between human CHC17 and CHC22 ( Figure 6 ) . Modeling using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) showed that residue 1316 is found at a key interface between triskelion legs in assembled clathrin ( Figure 6A and top of panel B ) . If M1316 is substituted by V1316 , the smaller side chain creates a void that would be energetically unfavorable ( Figure 6 , bottom of panel B ) , such that the triskelion leg might twist slightly to close the void . In the clathrin lattice , the legs have a torque that rotates the assembly interface along the protein sequence ( Wilbur et al . , 2005 ) , so a further twist could slightly adjust the interface , altering assembly interactions . Changes in the assembly interface could affect integrity of the lattice and potentially influence kinetics of assembly and disassembly . Mixed lattices of the two CHC22 allotypes would therefore have different properties from CHC22 coats formed in homozygotes for the two major CLTCL1 alleles . CHC22 is needed for the traffic of GLUT4 to its intracellular storage compartment , where GLUT4 awaits release to the plasma membrane in response to insulin . However , CHC22 also accumulates at the GLUT4 storage compartment ( GSC ) when it expands due to impaired GLUT4 release in cases of insulin-resistant type two diabetes ( T2D ) ( Vassilopoulos et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , genetic variation of CHC22 could alter rates of retention and release of GLUT4 in both healthy and disease states . To test whether the evolutionary change from M1316 to V1316 in CHC22 clathrin alters its properties , three aspects of CHC22 biochemistry and function were compared for the two allotypes . HeLa cells were transfected with constructs encoding each CHC22 variant or CHC17 , tagged with green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) . Atypically for their epithelial cell origin but not for transformed cells , HeLa cells express CHC22 clathrin ( they are homozygous for the M1316 allotype ) ( Adey et al . , 2013; Landry et al . , 2013 ) . We observed that the transfected fluorescently tagged CHC22 allotypes were both concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cell , similar to endogenous CHC22-M1316 detected by antibody , and did not overlap with endogenous CHC17 ( Figure 7A ) . Conversely , transfected GFP-CHC17 did not overlap with endogenous CHC22 , so expression of the transfected CHCs reflected their natural distribution ( Dannhauser et al . , 2017 ) . Using these constructs , the dynamics of membrane association for the two allotypes of CHC22 and for CHC17 was assessed by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching ( FRAP ) . To assess clathrin turnover , as an indicator of clathrin coat stability , cells expressing fluorescent proteins were photobleached in the perinuclear area ( Figure 7B ) and their rate of fluorescence recovery was measured . Recovery of CHC17 fluorescence was the fastest , consistent with its more soluble properties compared to CHC22 ( Dannhauser et al . , 2017 ) . CHC22-M1316 showed the slowest recovery and CHC22-V1316 was intermediate ( Figure 7C\u2013E ) , suggesting that it is more exchangeable in the CHC22 coat than the M1316 allotype . The impact of CHC22 variation on GLUT4 retention was then assessed . Because HeLa cells express CHC22 , they can form a GSC , when transfected to express GLUT4 . These cells sequester GLUT4 intracellularly , and then release it to the plasma membrane in response to insulin , behaving like muscle and adipocytes , though with more modest insulin response ( Camus et al . , 2018; Trefely et al . , 2015; Haga et al . , 2011 ) . To detect GLUT4 release to the cell surface , we used a construct expressing GLUT4 tagged with mCherry and a hemagglutinin ( HA ) epitope embedded in an exofacial loop of the transporter ( HA-GLUT4-mCherry ) . Appearance of surface GLUT4 in response to insulin was detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) using an antibody to the HA epitope ( Figure 8A ) . Transfection of HeLa cells with siRNA depleting CHC22 ablates this insulin-responsive pathway ( Camus et al . , 2018 ) ( Figure 8A ) . We then assessed if siRNA inhibition of insulin-responsive GLUT4 release can be rescued by expression of CHC22-M1316-GFP or CHC22-V1316-GFP . These constructs , the same as characterized in Figure 7A , are siRNA-resistant , as well as being GFP-tagged . We observed that , when endogenous CHC22 was depleted , CHC22-M1316 was able to restore the insulin response but CHC22-V1316 was not , when the rescue constructs were expressed at the same levels in cells ( measured by intensity of GFP fluorescence ) ( Figure 8A ) . CHC17 expression also did not rescue insulin-induced GLUT4 expression , as shown previously ( Vassilopoulos et al . , 2009 ) . However , CHC22-V1316 is functional for trapping GLUT4 intracellularly because CHC22-transgenic mice that express CHC22-V1316 in muscle , using the natural human promoter , show excessive GLUT4 sequestration in muscle compared to wild-type mice without CHC22 , leading to higher blood glucose in the transgenic animals ( Vassilopoulos et al . , 2009 ) . To analyze GLUT4 sequestration in another way , cells depleted for CHC22 and then transfected with mCherry-GLUT4 plus either CHC22 allotype or CHC17 were each divided into three populations expressing equivalently low , medium and high levels of the transfected CHC-GFP . Then , the total GLUT4 content of the cells was measured by mCherry fluorescence . We observed higher levels of GLUT4 in CHC22-depleted\u00a0cells expressing CHC22-M1316-GFP , compared to cells expressing either CHC22-V1316-GFP or CHC17-GFP at both medium and high levels of CHC expression ( Figure 8B ) . This suggests that GLUT4 is sequestered more effectively from degradative membrane traffic pathways when trafficked by CHC22-M1316 than by CHC22-V1316 , indicating that the M1316 variant is more efficient at targeting GLUT4 to the GSC . As indicated by their weak insulin response compared to muscle or fat cells , HeLa cells are only just able to form a functional GSC from which GLUT4 can be released . For these cells , the less effective CHC22-V1316 is inadequate to restore GSC formation when their endogenous CHC22-M1316 is depleted . Use of this HeLa model was necessitated by the lack of natural models for the CHC22-dependent GLUT4 pathway in myoblasts and adipocytes , as well as a lack of antibodies that detect surface GLUT4 . Nonetheless , these experiments demonstrate a functional difference between CHC22-M1316 and CHC22-V1316 and suggest that CHC22-V1316 is less efficient at GLUT4 sequestration . \n We studied the phylogenetics and population genetics of CHC22 clathrin to understand the functional variation of this protein in relation to its evolutionary history . CHC22 clathrin is a key player in post-prandial blood glucose clearance in humans through its role in intracellular packaging of the GLUT4 glucose transporter in muscle and fat , the tissues in which CHC22 and GLUT4 are expressed ( Vassilopoulos et al . , 2009 ) . The CHC22 pathway positions GLUT4 for cell surface release in response to insulin and consequent uptake of glucose into these tissues ( Bryant et al . , 2002 ) . The CLTCL1 gene encoding CHC22 resulted from gene duplication that we have now dated to 494\u2013451 MYA , early in vertebrate evolution when jawed vertebrates emerged . We had previously shown that CLTCL1 is a pseudogene in mice ( Wakeham et al . , 2005 ) . Expanding analysis to 56 jawed\u00a0vertebrate genomes ( >5X coverage ) we could not detect CLTCL1 in nine of\u00a0them . Six of these absences can be ascribed to two independent gene loss events in branches of the Rodentia and the Cetartidactylae . The three others may represent additional gene losses or incomplete genome annotation . All vertebrate and non-vertebrate eukaryotes considered here have retained the parent CLTC gene encoding CHC17 clathrin , which mediates endocytosis and other housekeeping membrane traffic pathways . The analysis described here establishes that CLTC is under strong purifying selection . Notable is our evidence for purifying selection on CLTCL1 in the species in which it has been retained , supporting its functional importance in those species . Compared to CLTC , extensive allelic diversity was observed for CLTCL1 in all species for which populations were analyzed , including humans , chimpanzees and bears . Variant alleles were species-specific in most cases . In all human populations , two allelic variants of CLTCL1 are present in high frequency , differing only at one nucleotide , resulting in CHC22 protein with either methionine or valine at position 1316 . The V1316 allotype appears specific to humans , but some non-human primates have a different variation at the position 1316 . Analysis of ancient humans dated the appearance of the V1316 variant to 500\u201350 KYA and indicated that M1316 , which is fixed in CHC17 clathrin , is the ancestral state . Analyses of human population genetic data provided support for the maintenance of high genetic diversity and two allotypes of CHC22 . We hypothesize that selective pressure on CHC22 clathrin comes from its role in nutrient metabolism . Consistent with this hypothesis , we observed functional differences between the two CHC22 allotypes in their capacity to control GLUT4 membrane traffic , as predicted by structural modeling and differences in cellular dynamics of the two allotypes . Retention of CLTC in all vertebrate species is consistent with the encoded CHC17 mediating cellular housekeeping clathrin functions shared by all eukaryotes . On the other hand , CHC22 , encoded by the paralogous gene CLTCL1 , operates in the specialized insulin-responsive GLUT4 pathway to make the pathway more efficient in those species that retained CLTCL1 . Data presented here ( Figure 8 ) and our recent mapping of a novel intracellular location for CHC22 function ( Camus et al . , 2018 ) indicate that , in human cells , CHC22 clathrin promotes transport from the secretory pathway to the insulin-responsive GSC . This CHC22 pathway complements the endocytic pathway for GLUT4 targeting to the GSC , so species without CHC22 can rely primarily on endocytosis for GLUT4 trafficking to the GSC , while species with CHC22 use both pathways . Thus , we hypothesize that species with functional CHC22 clathrin are more efficient at intracellular GLUT4 sequestration , resulting in lower surface GLUT4 in the absence of insulin , and tighter regulation of GLUT4 release in response to insulin . The trade-off is that these species have an inherent increased tendency to insulin resistance as their GLUT4 is sequestered more effectively . The two main vertebrate branches that have lost CHC22 comprise the Muridae ( mice and rats ) who are incessant herbivores and the Cetartiodactyla ( sheep , cattle , porpoise and pigs ) which include the ruminants ( sheep and cattle ) whose muscle uptake of glucose is critical for muscle function , but is not a main pathway for glucose clearance ( Hocquette et al . , 1995 ) . These two groups of species require greater availability of GLUT4 on their cell surfaces , so that more efficient GLUT4 sequestration by CHC22 would not be favorable to their nutritional needs . The fact that CHC22 alters the balance of membrane traffic to the GSC means that species losing CLTCL1 could evolve compensatory pathways more compatible with their diets . Thus , transgenic mice expressing CHC22 over-sequester GLUT4 in their muscle and develop hyperglycemia with aging ( Vassilopoulos et al . , 2009 ) . The cave fish , which appears to lack CLTCL1 , has independently evolved mutations in the insulin receptor , creating natural insulin resistance , such that the presence of CHC22 on top of this mechanism might be detrimental ( Riddle et al . , 2018 ) . The loss of CLTCL1 from cave fish is consistent with the insulin responsive GLUT4 pathway being a target for natural selection driven by diet , which might also explain CLTCL1 variation or loss for additional vertebrate species during vertebrate evolution . The allelic variation reported here for CLTCL1 in human and bear populations further supports the hypothesis that CLTCL1 has undergone continued selection during vertebrate evolution in relation to diet . While purifying selection appears to be operating on CLTCL1 in those species that retain it , CLTCL1 is far more variable than CLTC in these species . In humans , we find two major and functionally distinct alleles at remarkably similar frequencies in all populations studied . Statistical analysis comparing early farmer and hunter-gatherer populations shows an apparent increase of the V1316 variant , suggesting a correlation with regular consumption of digestible carbohydrate . Notably , the SNP distinguishing these alleles is human-specific and likely arose 550\u201350 KYA ( i . e . post-Neanderthal split , pre-Neolithic ) . Other dramatic increases in digestible carbohydrate utilization have been inferred for humans in this timeframe; in particular the advent of cooking ( which gelatinizes crystalized starch , making it much easier to digest ) , salivary amylase gene copy number increase ( allowing increased starch digestion capacity ) and accelerated brain size increase ( which would increase demands for blood glucose ) ( Hardy et al . , 2015 ) . While the co-evolution of these cultural and genetic traits was originally proposed to have occurred some 800 KYA , recent studies indicate a time frame of 450\u2013300 KYA years for cooking ( Shahack-Gross et al . , 2014 ) , increased oral amylase activity ( Inchley et al . , 2016 ) and accelerated brain size increase ( Dunbar , 2019 ) . The fact that the two major human CLTCL1 alleles are functionally distinct is consistent with diversifying selection operating on CLTCL1 , with a balancing selection possibly caused by heterozygote advantage . While population genetic signatures for balancing or overdominant selection were not entirely robust , some summary statistics were suggestive of an increased diversity that was unlikely to have occurred under neutrality . Other statistics , such as the ones based on allele frequencies , would not be expected to gain significance within the timeframe of the human-specific diversifying selection we detect . The allelic diversity of CLTCL1 in other primate species could have the potential effect of diluting its function . Whilst chimpanzees are omnivores and gorillas herbivores , both rely for nutrition on extensive foraging for carbohydrate . Also notable is that polar bears , who have a very low carbohydrate diet compared to their brown bear relatives , have distinct CHC22 variants with unknown functionality , again consistent with CLTCL1 undergoing selection driven by nutritional ecology . Clathrins are self-assembling proteins and function as a latticed network in the protein coat that they form on transport vesicles . Our structural modeling predicts that the single amino acid difference between the two main human CHC22 allotypes could influence the strength of molecular interactions in the CHC22 clathrin lattice , as position 1316 occurs at a lattice assembly interface ( Figure 6 ) . When expressed in cells , both CHC22 variants gave the same overall intracellular distribution , but CHC22-V1316 shows faster turnover from membranes than CHC22-M1316 ( Figure 7 ) and is less effective at GLUT4 sequestration ( Figure 8B ) . These properties are consistent with the methionine to valine change attenuating GLUT4 retention . This interpretation is further supported by a GLUT4 translocation assay , which indicates that the V1316 variant is less effective in forming the insulin-responsive GSC than the ancestral M1316 form of CHC22 ( Figure 8A ) . Thus , mixed lattices occurring in heterozygous individuals , potentially reflect balancing selection and overdominance , might reduce GLUT4 sequestration compared to M1316 homozygotes . This would have the effect of improving glucose clearance . It can be argued that human consumption of digestible carbohydrate on a regular basis ( Hardy et al . , 2015 ) , requiring increased glucose clearance , might be a selective force driving this genetic adaptation . This view is consistent with the increased frequency of the V1316 variant in early farmers . It is also possible that some forms of polar bear CHC22 are super-active at GLUT4 sequestration , providing a route to maintain high blood glucose , as occurs through other mutations in the cave fish ( Riddle et al . , 2018 ) . Regulators of fundamental membrane traffic pathways have diversified through gene duplication in many species over the timespan of eukaryotic evolution . Retention and loss can , in some cases , be correlated with special requirements resulting from species differentiation , such as the extensive elaboration of genes in the secretory pathway of Tetrahymena ( Dacks and Robinson , 2017; Bright et al . , 2010 ) . The evolutionary history of CLTCL1 , following vertebrate-specific gene duplication , suggests that differentiation of nutritional habits has shaped selection for the presence and absence of CLTCL1 in some vertebrate species , and its diversification in humans and potentially other species . Though its highest expression is in muscle and adipose tissue , transient expression of CHC22 during human brain development has also been documented ( Nahorski et al . , 2015 ) . This was noted in a study of a very rare null mutant of CLTCL1 that caused loss of pain sensing in homozygotes and no symptoms for heterozygotes ( Nahorski et al . , 2015 ) . Attenuated CHC22 function of the V1316 variant might lead to a spectrum of pain\u00a0sensing in humans but this is unlikely to be a strong selective force affecting reproductive success , whereas glucose homeostasis , as suggested by our analysis , is more likely . By exerting efficient control of blood glucose levels , the presence of CHC22 clathrin was likely beneficial in providing the nutrition required to develop the large human brain , as well as affecting reproduction by influencing glucose availability during pregnancy ( Hardy et al . , 2015 ) . However , over the last 12 , 500 years in association with farming , or perhaps over the last 450 , 000 years in association with cooking , salivary amylase activity and starch digestion ( Hardy et al . , 2015; Shahack-Gross et al . , 2014; Inchley et al . , 2016 ) , readily available carbohydrate has increased our need to clear glucose from the blood , such that selection continues to act on CLTCL1 in humans . Our cell biology studies have also demonstrated that CHC22 increases GLUT4 retention . While we would not expect the major CLTCL1 polymorphism to directly influence the development of T2D , CHC22 accumulates on the expanded GSC that forms in cases of insulin-resistant T2D ( Vassilopoulos et al . , 2009 ) , so its variation could potentially exacerbate insulin resistance to different degrees . The genetic diversity that we report here may reflect evolution towards reversing a human tendency to insulin resistance and have relevance to coping with increased carbohydrate in modern diets . \n Vertebrate genomes as well as genomes of Drosophila melanogaster , Caenorhabditis elegans , Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi were downloaded from Ensembl ( Yates et al . , 2016 ) , all accessed on 23/04/2016 except for pig ( 14/12/2017 ) , marmoset and hagfish ( both 09/08/2018 ) , excluding vertebrate species sequenced below five-fold genome coverage , that\u00a0is with less than five reads per site on average . In addition , we downloaded the genomes of the elephant\u00a0shark ( Venkatesh et al . , 2014 ) , whale\u00a0shark ( Read et al . , 2017 ) , marmot ( The Alpine Marmot Genome , BioProject PRJEB8272 on NCBI ) and porpoise ( Yuan et al . , 2018 ) . All potential orthologs for the human isoforms of CLTC/CLTCL1 , MTMR4/MTMR3 , and CLTA/CLTB , in the above genomes were retrieved via BLAST ( Boratyn et al . , 2013 ) . An e-value threshold of 0 . 001 with additional constraints applied by default in InParanoid version 7 ( Ostlund et al . , 2010 ) were used ( at least 50% of the sequences are covered by the alignment , and at least 25% of the residues are aligned ) . The polar bear ( Ursus maritimus ) ( Liu et al . , 2014 ) , brown bear ( Ursus arctos ) ( Benazzo et al . , 2017 ) and black bear ( Ursus americanus ) CHC17 and CHC22 protein sequences were manually added . For CLTCL1 only the elephant and horse sequences ( XP_023397213 . 1 and XP_023502410 . 1 respectively ) were manually added . The sequences corresponding to the longest transcripts were aligned with MAFFT ( Katoh and Standley , 2013 ) and phylogenetic trees generated with PhyML ( Guindon et al . , 2010 ) . The last two steps were repeated after manually removing outlier sequences lying on long branches ( CLTC/CLTCL1: ENSTNIP00000007811 . 1 , ENSTGUP00000014952 . 1 , XP_023397213 . 1 , XP_023502410 . 1; CLTA/CLTB: ENSPSIP00000012669 . 1 ) and , in the case of genomes not retrieved from Ensembl ( therefore lacking the gene-to-transcript mapping ) , sequences most likely corresponding to alternative transcripts ( XP_015350877 . 1 , XP_007899998 . 1 , XP_007899997 . 1 , XP_007904368 . 1 , XP_007904367 . 1 , XP_020375861 . 1 , XP_020375865 . 1 , XP_020375862 . 1 , XP_020392037 . 1 , XP_020375864 . 1 , XP_020375859 . 1 ) . Trees were manually reconciled based on the Ensembl species tree extended by elephant\u00a0shark , whale shark , brown\u00a0bear , black bear , porpoise and marmot with TreeGraph ( St\u00f6ver and M\u00fcller , 2010 ) . Branch lengths were estimated based on the multiple sequence alignment ( MSA ) with PhyML fixing the manually reconciled topology , with options \u2018-u\u2019 and \u2018--constraint_file\u2019 . With this approach no support values for splits are calculated . The resulting trees were used as input to generate a new phylogeny-aware MSAs with PRANK ( L\u00f6ytynoja and Goldman , 2005 ) . Branch lengths of the reconciled topologies were then re-estimated based on the MSA generated by PRANK . To compute evolutionary rates , the sequences and subtrees corresponding to CLTC and CLTCL1 clades after duplication ( i . e . excluding non-vertebrates ) were extracted and sequences from species without either CLTC or CLTCL1 were removed . The same procedure was performed for MTMR4/MTMR3 and CLTA/CLTB . A phylogeny-aware MSA was computed with PRANK on the remaining sequences , and the amino acid alignment was converted to a codon alignment with PAL2NAL ( Suyama et al . , 2006 ) . Finally , dN/dS ratios ( i . e . the ratio of the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions to the rate of synonymous substitutions ) were inferred based on the codon alignments with PAML ( Yang , 2007 ) for the six proteins independently using the site model M7 . Model M7 fits a Beta-distribution to the site rates by estimating the two Beta parameters shape and scale . Rates are estimated per site over the entire phylogeny , and therefore represent time averages . Phylogenetic trees of consensus amino acid sequences for bear samples only were computed using PhyML 3 . 1 ( Guindon et al . , 2010 ) with default values as implemented in Phylogeny . fr ( Dereeper et al . , 2008 ) . Phased genotypes were obtained by querying Variant Call Format ( VCF ) files ( Danecek et al . , 2011 ) from the 1000 Genomes Project database Phase 3 ( 1000 Auton et al . , 2015 ) for all available 2504 samples . Only high-quality variants were retained using vcflib ( https://github . com/vcflib/vcflib ) with options \u2018VT\u00a0=\u00a0SNP and QUAL\u00a0>\u00a01 and AC\u00a0>1 and DP\u00a0>5000\u2019 . Missing genotypes were assigned to homozygotes for the reference alleles . Finally , only sites with a recorded annotated function of being missense , nonsense , stop-loss or frame-shift for tested genes according to the UCSC Table Browser were retained ( Speir et al . , 2016 ) ( tables snp150 and snp150CodingDbSnp ) . For each retained position , the reference sequence for chimpanzee from the UCSC Table Browser ( Speir et al . , 2016 ) ( table snp150OrthoPt5Pa2Rm8 ) was initially used to infer the putative ancestral state . For ambiguous or multiallelic states in the chimpanzee sequence , the human reference base was used as an initial proxy for the ancestral state . The predicted functional impact of amino acid replacements was obtained by using Polyphen ( Adzhubei et al . , 2010 ) and SIFT ( Kumar et al . , 2009 ) . Additional frequency information for a single mutation of interest in more than 50 human populations was retrieved from the HGDP CEPH Panel ( Cann et al . , 2002 ) from\u00a0http://hgdp . uchicago . edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/HGDP/ . Genotype data for farmer and hunter-gatherer individuals were collected from the Simons Genome Diversity Project Dataset ( Mallick et al . , 2016 ) . Populations were merged based on their assigned geographical region with the following classification for hunter-gatherers: Africa ( Biaka , Ju|\u2018hoan North , Khomani San , Mbuti ) , Central Asia and Siberia ( Aluet , Chukchi , Eskimo Chaplin , Eskimo Naukan , Eskimo Sireniki , Even , Itelman , Tlingit , Tubalar , Ulchi , Atayal ) , East and South Asia ( Atayal , Kusunda ) . Farmer and hunter-gatherer allele frequencies were compared following a previously described approach ( Raineri et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly , we analytically computed the probability that the V allele is more frequent in farmers than in hunter gatherers while fully accounting for the uncertainty in the individual frequency estimates . V allele frequencies were inferred from allele counts of M and V in a Bayesian framework with a conjugate Beta uniform prior . We recorded maximum a posteriori estimates with 95% highest posterior density credible intervals computed with the Smisc R library , version 0 . 3 . 9 . We collected further published ancient DNA data from Western Eurasia and classified into three genetic grouping: hunter-gatherer ( HG ) , early farmer ( EF ) and steppe , using supervised ADMIXTURE ( Alexander et al . , 2009 ) as previously described ( Mathieson and Mathieson , 2018 ) . These are genetic groups and not directly based on differences in material culture or subsistence , but importantly in the case of HG and EF , these genetic classifications correspond closely to hunter-gatherer and agricultural subsistence strategies ( Haak et al . , 2015; Skoglund et al . , 2014; Skoglund et al . , 2012 ) . We then restricted analysis to samples dated between 10 , 000 and 5 , 000 years before present that were classified as either HG or EF , leading to a dataset of 119 HG and 316 EF of which 85 and 188 respectively had coverage at rs1061325 . Frequencies for South-East Asians and ancient Eurasians were down-sampled to ensure numerical stability . The HeLa genomic data were accessed through the NIH database of Genotypes and Phenotypes ( dbGaP at http://www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/sites/entrez ? db=gap ) through dbGaP accession number phs000640 . High-coverage VCF files for 79 individuals from six species of great apes were retrieved ( Prado-Martinez et al . , 2013 ) . Data was filtered using vcflib on the combined data set with the options \u2018QUAL\u00a0>\u00a032 and DP\u00a0>50 and DP\u00a0<7000 and FS\u00a0<27 and MQ\u00a0>\u00a025 and AC\u00a0>1\u2019 , similarly to the original manuscript describing this data set ( Prado-Martinez et al . , 2013 ) . To retrieve nonsynonymous changes , only variants where the translated proteins for each allele differ were retained . We finally phased the data and assigned individual haplotypes using shapeit v2 . r837 with the options \u2018-burn 50 -prune 20 -main 100 -window 0 . 5 -effective-size 20000\u2019 . Additional 110 genomes of chimpanzees and bonobos were analyzed ( Teixeira et al . , 2015; de Manuel et al . , 2016 ) . Data filtering , functional annotation and haplotype phasing were performed as described above . Full genome VCF files for two high-coverage archaic humans , namely one Altai Neanderthal ( Pr\u00fcfer et al . , 2014 ) and one Denisova were retrieved ( Meyer et al . , 2012 ) . Low-quality sites were filtered out using vcflib with the options \u2018QUAL\u00a0>\u00a01 and DP\u00a0>10\u2019 . A pseudo-reference sequence for each archaic human was constructed by replacing the heterozygous sites with the previously inferred human ancestral state . Sequencing data information for additional ancient human samples were obtained from previously published high-quality whole genome sequences ( Skoglund et al . , 2014; Broushaki et al . , 2016; Hofmanov\u00e1 et al . , 2016; Lazaridis et al . , 2014; Olalde et al . , 2014; Raghavan et al . , 2014; Seguin-Orlando et al . , 2014; Fu et al . , 2014 ) . Genotype likelihoods were calculated using the standard GATK model ( McKenna et al . , 2010 ) . Median-joining network plots were generated in R using pegas package ( Paradis , 2010 ) . Several summary statistics were calculated on the inferred alleles to describe their levels of nucleotide diversity . Specifically , for each population separately , Watterson\u2019s estimator of population mutation parameter ( TW ) ( Watterson , 1975 ) , Nei\u2019s genetic diversity index ( PI ) ( Nei , 1973 ) , Tajima\u2019s D ( TD ) ( Tajima , 1989 ) , Fu and Li\u2019s D* ( FLDs ) and F* ( FLFs ) ( Fu and Li , 1993 ) , the sum of squared allele frequencies including the most common allele ( H1 ) and excluding it ( H2 ) and their normalized ratio ( H2H1 ) ( Garud and Rosenberg , 2015; Garud et al . , 2015 ) were calculated . We also computed genetic differentiation ( FST ) ( Reynolds et al . , 1983 ) between pairs of canonical reference populations , namely Yoruban ( YRI ) , Europeans ( CEU ) , and Han Chinese ( CHB ) . To assess whether the observed summary statistics are expected under neutral evolution , genes with a coding length approximately equal ( \u00b15% ) to the one observed for the tested gene , CLTCL1 , were selected . For this analysis , the longest isoform for each gene , and its annotation was considered according to refGene table from the UCSC Genome Browser . We discarded genes on chromosome six and on sex chromosomes , as well as CLTA , CLTB and CLTC . This set was further reduced to the first 500 genes with the closest genomic length to CLTCL1 . As summary statistics can be calculated only in case of genetic variability , genes showing no non-synonymous SNPs within each population were discarded . For each summary statistic , the empirical percentile rank for the value observed in CLTCL1 compared to the whole distribution of control genes was calculated . Low or high values are suggestive of CLTCL1 being an outlier in the empirical distribution . For plotting purposes , summary statistics and populations were clustered according to a dendrogram inferred from their respective distances based on the calculated matrix of empirical percentile ranks . That is , populations clustering together exhibit similar patterns of percentile ranks , and thus of summary statistics . The underlying dendrograms are not reported . The heatmap plot was generated using the function heatmap . 2 in R with the package gplots . Cells with an empirical percentile rank lower than 0 . 10 or greater than 0 . 90 were filled with the exact rank value . We also obtained a null distribution of summary statistics by performing coalescent simulations using msms ( Ewing and Hermisson , 2010 ) under a previously derived demographic model for human populations ( Gutenkunst et al . , 2009 ) . MODELLER v9 . 13 ( Benjamin and Sali , 2014 ) was used to model the structure of the proximal leg segment of CHC22 , using the crystal structure of bovine CHC17 ( PDB 1B89 ) ( Ybe et al . , 1999 ) as a template . The model of the M1316V mutant was derived in a similar way using a mutated sequence . Structure visualization and analysis of residue interactions at the mutation site M1316 were performed using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . The wild type and mutant homology models were positioned in the cryo-electron microscopy map of the bovine clathrin lattice ( EMD: 5119 ) ( Fotin et al . , 2004 ) by structural superposition on the atomic model originally fitted in the map ( PDB\u00a01XI4 ) ."}

When changes , or mutations , occur within these genes , malfunctioning proteins that are damaging to the cell may be produced . Researchers of human genetics have tried to spot the genetic mutations that are associated with illnesses , for example heart diseases . However , they found that most of these mutations are actually located outside of genes , in the \u2018non-coding\u2019 areas that make up the majority of our genome . These mutations do not modify proteins directly , which makes it challenging to understand how they may be related to heart conditions . One possibility is that the genetic changes affect regions called enhancers , which control where , when and how much a gene is turned on by physically interacting with it . Mutations in enhancers could lead to a gene producing too much or too little of a protein , which might create problems in the cell . Yet , it is difficult to match an enhancer with the gene or genes it controls . One reason is that a non-coding region can influence a gene placed far away on the DNA strand . Indeed , the long DNA molecule precisely folds in on itself to fit inside its compartment in the cell , which can bring together distant sequences . Montefiori et al . take over 500 non-coding areas , which can carry mutations associated with heart diseases , and use a technique called Hi-C to try to identify which genes these regions may control . The tool can model the 3D organization of the genome , and it was further modified to capture only the regions of the genome that contain genes , and the DNA sequences that interact with them , in human heart cells . This helped to create a 3D map of 347 genes which come in contact with the non-coding areas that carry mutations associated with heart diseases . In fact , deleting those genes often causes heart disorders in mice . In addition , Montefiori et al . reveal that 90% of the non-coding regions examined were influencing genes that were far away . This shows that , despite a common assumption , enhancers often do not regulate the coding sequences they are nearest to on the DNA strand . Pinpointing the genes regulated by the non-coding regions involved in cardiovascular diseases could lead to new ways of treating or preventing these conditions . The 3D map created by Montefiori et al . may also help to visualize how the genetic information is organized in heart cells . This will contribute to the current effort to understand the role of the 3D structure of the genome , especially in different cell types .", "source": "Over 500 genetic loci have been associated with risk of cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs ) ; however , most loci are located in gene-distal non-coding regions and their target genes are not known . Here , we generated high-resolution promoter capture Hi-C ( PCHi-C ) maps in human induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes ( CMs ) to provide a resource for identifying and prioritizing the functional targets of CVD associations . We validate these maps by demonstrating that promoters preferentially contact distal sequences enriched for tissue-specific transcription factor motifs and are enriched for chromatin marks that correlate with dynamic changes in gene expression . Using the CM PCHi-C map , we linked 1999 CVD-associated SNPs to 347 target genes . Remarkably , more than 90% of SNP-target gene interactions did not involve the nearest gene , while 40% of SNPs interacted with at least two genes , demonstrating the importance of considering long-range chromatin interactions when interpreting functional targets of disease loci . \n A major goal in human genetics research is to understand genetic contributions to complex diseases , specifically the molecular mechanisms by which common DNA variants impact disease etiology . Most genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) implicate non-coding variants that are far from genes , complicating interpretation of their mode of action and correct identification of the target gene ( Maurano et al . , 2012 ) . Mounting evidence suggests that disease variants disrupt the function of cis-acting regulatory elements , such as enhancers , which in turn affects expression of the specific gene or genes that are functional targets of these elements ( Wright et al . , 2010; Musunuru et al . , 2010; Cowper-Sal lari et al . , 2012; Smemo et al . , 2014; Claussnitzer et al . , 2015 ) . However , because cis-acting regulatory elements can be located kilobases ( kb ) away from their target gene ( s ) , identifying the true functional targets of regulatory elements remains challenging ( Smemo et al . , 2014 ) . Chromosome conformation capture techniques such as Hi-C ( Lieberman-Aiden et al . , 2009 ) enable the genome-wide mapping of long-range chromatin contacts and therefore represent a promising strategy to identify distal gene targets of disease-associated genetic variants . Recently , Hi-C maps have been generated in numerous human cell types including embryonic stem cells and early embryonic lineages ( Dixon et al . , 2012 , 2015 ) , immune cells ( Rao et al . , 2014 ) , fibroblasts ( Jin et al . , 2013 ) and other primary tissue types ( Schmitt et al . , 2016 ) . However , despite the increasing abundance of Hi-C maps , most datasets are of limited resolution ( >40 kb ) and do not precisely identify the genomic regions in contact with gene promoters . More recently , promoter capture Hi-C ( PCHi-C ) was developed which greatly increases the power to detect interactions involving promoter sequences ( Schoenfelder et al . , 2015; Mifsud et al . , 2015 ) . PCHi-C in different cell types identified thousands of enhancer-promoter contacts and revealed extensive differences in promoter architecture between cell types and throughout differentiation ( Schoenfelder et al . , 2015; Mifsud et al . , 2015; Javierre et al . , 2016; Freire-Pritchett et al . , 2017; Rubin et al . , 2017; Siersb\u00e6k et al . , 2017 ) . These studies collectively demonstrated that genome architecture reflects cell identity , suggesting that disease-relevant cell types are critical for successful interrogation of the gene regulatory mechanisms of disease loci . In support of this notion , several recent studies utilized high-resolution promoter interaction maps to identify tissue-specific target genes of GWAS associations . Javierre et al . generated promoter capture Hi-C data in 17 primary human blood cell types and identified 2604 potentially causal genes for immune- and blood-related disorders , including many genes with unannotated roles in those diseases ( Javierre et al . , 2016 ) . Similarly , Mumbach et al . interrogated GWAS SNPs associated with autoimmune diseases using HiChIP where they identified\u00a0~10 , 000 promoter-enhancer interactions that linked several hundred SNPs to target genes , most of which were not the nearest gene ( Mumbach et al . , 2017 ) . Importantly , both studies reported cell-type specificity of SNP-target gene interactions . Cardiovascular diseases , including cardiac arrhythmia , heart failure , and myocardial infarction , continue to be the leading cause of death world-wide . Over 50 GWAS have been conducted for these specific cardiovascular phenotypes alone , with more than 500 loci implicated in cardiovascular disease risk ( NHGRI GWAS catalog , https://www . ebi . ac . uk/gwas/ ) , most of which map to non-coding genomic regions . To begin to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which genetic variants contribute to CVD risk , a comprehensive gene regulatory map of human cardiac cells is required . Here , we present high-resolution promoter interaction maps of human iPSCs and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes ( CMs ) . Using PCHi-C , we identified hundreds of thousands of promoter interactions in each cell type . We demonstrate the physiological relevance of these datasets by functionally interrogating the relationship between gene expression and long-range promoter interactions , and demonstrate the utility of long-range chromatin interaction data to resolve the functional targets of disease-associated loci . \n We used iPSC-derived CMs ( Burridge et al . , 2014 ) as a model to study cardiovascular gene regulation and disease genetics . The CMs generated in this study were 86\u201394% pure based on cardiac Troponin T protein expression and exhibited spontaneous , uniform beating ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A , Video 1 ) . To demonstrate that iPSCs and CMs recapitulate transcriptional and epigenetic profiles of matched primary cells , we conducted RNA-seq and ChIP-seq for the active enhancer mark H3K27ac in both cell types and compared these data with similar cell types from the Epigenome Roadmap Project ( Kundaje et al . , 2015 ) . RNA-seq profiles of iPSCs clustered tightly with H1 embryonic stem cells , whereas CMs clustered with both left ventricle ( LV ) and fetal heart ( FH ) profiles ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Furthermore , we observed that matched cell types exhibited three-fold greater overlap in the number of promoter-distal H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks than non-matched cell types ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C , D ) , indicating that both iPSCs and CMs recapitulate tissue-specific epigenetic states of human stem cells and primary cardiomyocytes , respectively . To further validate our system , we analyzed differentially expressed genes between iPSCs and CMs . Among the top 10% of over-expressed genes in CMs were genes directly related to cardiac function including essential cardiac transcription factors ( GATA4 , MEIS1 , TBX5 , and TBX20 ) and differentiation products ( TNNT2 , MYH7B , MYL7 , ACTN2 , NPPA , HCN4 , and RYR2 ) ( fold-change\u00a0>1 . 5 , Padj\u00a0<0 . 05 , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C ) . Gene Ontology ( GO ) enrichment analysis for genes over-expressed in CMs relative to iPSCs further confirmed the cardiac-specific phenotypes of these cells with top terms relating to the development of the cardiac conduction system and cardiac muscle cell contraction ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D ) . To comprehensively map long-range regulatory elements in iPSCs and CMs , we performed in-situ Hi-C ( Rao et al . , 2014 ) in triplicate iPSC-CM differentiations; importantly , we used the four-cutter restriction enzyme MboI which generates ligation fragments with an average size of 422 bp , enabling enhancer-level resolution of promoter contacts . We enriched iPSC and CM in situ Hi-C libraries for promoter interactions through hybridization with a set of 77 , 476 biotinylated RNA probes ( \u2018baits\u2019 ) targeting 22 , 600 human RefSeq protein-coding promoters ( see Materials and methods ) and sequenced each library to an average depth of\u00a0~413 million ( M ) paired-end reads . After removing duplicates and read-pairs that did not map to a bait , we obtained an average of 31M and 41M read-pairs per replicate for iPSC and CM , respectively . We used CHiCAGO ( Cairns et al . , 2016 ) , a computational pipeline which accounts for bias from the sequence capture , to identify significant interactions and further filtered for those significant in at least two out of three replicates ( see Materials and methods ) . Finally , we exclusively focused on interactions that were separated by a distance of at least 10 kb . This criterion addresses the high frequency of close-proximity ligation evets in Hi-C data , which are difficult to distinguish as random Brownian contacts or functional chromatin interactions ( Cairns et al . , 2016 ) . In total , we identified 350 , 062 promoter interactions in iPSCs and 401 , 098 in CMs . A large proportion ( ~55% ) of interactions were shared between the two cell types , indicating that even at high resolution many long-range interactions are stable across cell types ( Figure 1A ) . Approximately 20% of all interactions were between two promoters , demonstrating the high connectivity between genes and supporting the recently suggested role of promoters acting as regulatory inputs for distal genes ( Dao et al . , 2017; Diao et al . , 2017 ) ( Figure 1B ) . Most interactions were promoter-distal , with a median of\u00a0~170 kb between the promoter and the distal-interacting region ( Figure 1C ) . To compare the PCHi-C maps with known features of genome organization , we sequenced our pre-capture Hi-C libraries to an average depth of 665M reads per cell type and identified topologically associating domains ( TADs ) with TopDom ( see Materials and methods ) . TADs are organizational units of chromosomes defined by\u00a0<1 megabase ( Mb ) genomic blocks that exhibit high self-interacting frequencies with a very low interaction frequency across TAD boundaries ( Dixon et al . , 2012; Nora et al . , 2012 ) . Notably , this organization is thought to constrain the activity of cis-regulatory elements to target genes within the same TAD , as disruption of TAD boundaries has been shown to lead to aberrant activation of genes in neighboring TADs ( Nora et al . , 2012; Lupi\u00e1\u00f1ez et al . , 2015; Franke et al . , 2016; Symmons et al . , 2016; Tsujimura et al . , 2015 ) . We found that the majority of PCHi-C interactions occurred within TADs ( 73 and 77% in iPSCs and CMs , respectively; Figure 1D and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A ) . TAD-crossing interactions ( \u2018inter-TAD\u2019 ) contained proportionally more promoter-promoter interactions than intra-TAD interactions , and were more likely to overlap promoter-distal CTCF sites; however , they were similarly enriched for looping to distal H3K27ac sites , a mark of active chromatin ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2013D ) . Inter-TAD interactions had slightly lower CHiCAGO scores , reflecting a lower number of reads supporting these interactions , and spanned greater genomic distances than intra-TAD interactions ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3E , F ) . Additionally , promoters with inter-TAD interactions were preferentially located close to TAD boundaries ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3G ) and had higher expression levels compared to promoters with intra-TAD interactions , particularly in CMs ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3H ) . These observations are consistent with previous studies which demonstrated that highly expressed genes , specifically housekeeping genes , are enriched at TAD boundaries ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ) . To illustrate the utility of high-resolution PCHi-C interaction maps , we highlight the GATA4 locus in Figure 1D and E . GATA4 is a master regulator of heart development ( Watt et al . , 2004; Pikkarainen et al . , 2004 ) and the GATA4 gene is located in a TAD structure that is relatively stable between iPSCs and CMs ( Figure 1D ) . However , PCHi-C identified increased interaction frequencies between the GATA4 promoter and several H3K27ac-marked regions , including four in vivo validated heart enhancers from the Vista enhancer browser ( Visel et al . , 2007 ) , specifically in CMs and coincident with strong up-regulation of GATA4 ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . Although TAD-based analyses help define a gene\u2019s cis-regulatory landscape , high-resolution promoter interaction data provides the resolution necessary to precisely map enhancer-promoter interactions in the context of cellular differentiation . To validate the CM interaction map as a resource for cardiovascular disease genetics we next extensively characterized several important aspects of genetic architecture in CMs . We compared CMs with iPSCs in each analysis as a measure of cell-type specificity . These analyses serve as benchmarks that build on established features of genome organization and aid interpretations of the roles that long range interactions play in gene regulation . Distal enhancers activate target genes through DNA looping , a mechanism that enables distally bound transcription factors to contact the transcription machinery of target promoters ( Pennacchio et al . , 2013; Miele and Dekker , 2008; Deng et al . , 2012 ) . To assess whether this feature of gene regulation was reflected in the iPSC and CM interactions , we conducted motif analysis using HOMER ( Heinz et al . , 2010 ) on the set of promoter-distal interacting sequences in each cell type . We initially focused on interactions for genes differentially expressed between iPSCs and CMs ( fold-change\u00a0>1 . 5 , Padj\u00a0<0 . 05 ) . We identified CTCF as the most enriched motif in each case ( Figure 2A , B ) , consistent with the known role of this factor in mediating long-range genomic interactions ( Phillips and Corces , 2009; Phillips-Cremins et al . , 2013; Nora et al . , 2017 ) . Among the other top motifs , we identified the pluripotency factor motifs OCT4-SOX2-TCF-NANOG ( OSN ) and SOX2 as preferentially enriched in distal sequences looping to genes over-expressed in iPSCs ( Figure 2A , C ) , whereas top motifs in distal sequences looping to genes over-expressed in CMs included TBX20 , ESRRB and MEIS1 ( Figure 2B , C ) . TBX20 and MEIS1 transcription factors are important regulators of heart development and function ( Cai et al . , 2005; Sakabe et al . , 2012; Mahmoud et al . , 2013 ) and ESRRB was previously identified as a potential binding partner of TBX20 in adult mouse cardiomyocytes ( Shen et al . , 2011 ) . We also observed that distal interactions unique to either iPSCs or CMs were similarly enriched for tissue-specific transcription factor motifs ( Figure 2D ) . In line with a recent report that AP-1 contributes to dynamic loop formation during macrophage development ( Phanstiel et al . , 2017 ) , both iPSC- and CM-specific interactions were enriched for AP-1 motifs ( Figure 2D ) , suggesting that AP-1 transcription factors may represent a previously unrecognized genome organizing complex . Functionally active cis-regulatory elements are characterized by the presence of specific histone modifications; active enhancers are generally associated with H3K4me1 and H3K27ac ( Creyghton et al . , 2010; Heintzman et al . , 2009 ) , whereas inactive ( e . g . poised or silenced ) elements are often associated with H3K27me3 ( Rada-Iglesias et al . , 2011; Erceg et al . , 2017 ) . In support of the gene-regulatory function of long-range interactions , we found that the promoter-distal MboI fragments involved in significant promoter interactions were enriched for these three histone modifications in both iPSCs and CMs ( Figure 3A\u2013C ) . When promoters were grouped by expression level , we observed that this enrichment increased with increasing expression for H3K27ac and H3K4me1 , and decreased with increasing expression for H3K27me3 , consistent with an additive nature of enhancer-promoter interactions ( Schoenfelder et al . , 2015; Javierre et al . , 2016 ) , and validating that PCHi-C enriches for likely functional long-range chromatin contacts . A strong correlation ( Pearson correlation coefficient r\u00a0>\u00a00 . 7 ) between the degree of histone modifications and gene expression was first reported nearly 10 years ago ( Karli\u0107 et al . , 2010 ) ; however , that analysis only considered histone modifications within 2 kb of promoters . To understand whether this relationship extends beyond promoter-proximal regions , we correlated the number of histone ChIP-seq peaks within 300 kb of promoters with the promoter\u2019s expression level ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . H3K27ac and H3K4me1 both positively correlated with expression level ( Spearman\u2019s \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00 . 22 and 0 . 16 , respectively in iPSC and \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00 . 23 and 0 . 24 , respectively in CMs , p<2 . 2\u221216 ) ; in contrast , H3K27me3 negatively correlated with expression level in CMs ( Spearman\u2019s \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120 . 20 , p<2 . 2\u221216 ) ; however , this relationship was not present in iPSCs ( Spearman\u2019s \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00 . 02 , p=0 . 06 ) . Although moderate , these correlations could partially explain why higher expressed genes show stronger enrichment for promoter interactions overlapping histone peaks when using a genome-wide background model ( see Materials and methods ) , and lends support to the notion that active genes are located in generally active genomic environments ( Stevens et al . , 2017; Gilbert et al . , 2004 ) . We next investigated the relationship between cell-type-specific interactions and enrichment for tissue-specific CTCF , H3K27ac , and H3K27me3 marks , hypothesizing that interactions unique to iPSCs or CMs would be most enriched for tissue-specific chromatin features . Indeed , we observed that cell-type-specific interactions preferentially involved H3K27ac peaks from the matched cell type , and were either not enriched ( iPSC ) or depleted ( CM ) for H3K27ac marks that were specific to the non-matched cell type ( Figure 3E , middle panel ) . However , the strongest enrichment was for cell-type-specific interactions to overlap chromatin features that were present in both cell types ( Figure 3E ) . Additionally , interactions that were shared between iPSCs and CMs were most enriched for shared chromatin features . These results suggest that all interactions , whether shared or unique to one cell type , preferentially contact regulatory regions that are active in both cell types , whereas cell-type-specific interactions are not likely to occur in regions specifically marked in the non-matched cell type . An example of a gene that encompasses these observations is the atrial natriuretic peptide gene NPPA ( Figure 3F ) which is specifically expressed in cells of the heart atrium and is upregulated in CMs ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . NPPA makes numerous cell-type-specific interactions to a distal region that is only marked with active chromatin ( H3K27ac and H3K4me1 ) in CMs; furthermore , functional characterization showed that this region corresponds to an in vivo enhancer recapitulating NPPA\u2019s endogenous expression in the developing heart ( Visel et al . , 2007 ) . Taken together , these results illuminate the complex relationship between long-range promoter interactions and gene regulation and provide evidence that promoter architecture reflects cell-type-specific gene expression . As a final benchmark of our datasets , we analyzed large-scale differences in genome organization between iPSCs and CMs . The first Hi-C studies revealed that the genome is organized in two major compartments , A and B , that correspond to open and closed regions of chromosomes , respectively ( Lieberman-Aiden et al . , 2009; Rao et al . , 2014 ) . Although most compartments are stable across different cell types , some compartments switch states in a cell-type-specific manner which may reflect important gene regulatory changes ( Dixon et al . , 2015 ) . To assess whether capture Hi-C data , which is more cost-effective for capturing promoter-centered interactions , is able to identify A/B compartments , we compared our capture Hi-C data with pre-capture , genome-wide Hi-C libraries . A/B compartments identified using HOMER ( Heinz et al . , 2010 ) were remarkably similar in the whole-genome and PCHi-C datasets ( 97% correspondence , Figure 4A , top panel , and Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2 ) , demonstrating that PCHi-C data contains sufficient information to identify broadly active and inactive regions of the genome . As an example , we highlight a 10 Mb region on chromosome 4 containing the CAMK2D gene locus ( Figure 4A ) . Compartments were relatively stable across this region in iPSCs and CMs; however , the CAMK2D gene itself was located in a dynamic compartment that switched from inactive in iPSCs to active in CMs . Correspondingly , this gene was highly upregulated during differentiation to CMs ( Figure 4A , inset ) . We observed this effect on a global level , as genes located in A compartments were expressed at significantly higher levels than genes located in the B compartments in both iPSCs and CMs ( Figure 4B ) . Additionally , genes that switched A/B compartments between cell types were correspondingly up- or down-regulated ( Figure 4C ) . GO analysis of the 1008 genes that switched from B to A compartments during iPSC-CM differentiation revealed enrichment for terms such as \u2018cardiovascular system development\u2019 and \u2018heart contraction\u2019 ( Figure 4D , Supplementary file 5 ) . Importantly , these genes were identified based solely on their location in a dynamic genomic compartment and not from gene expression data . GO analysis for genes that switched from A to B compartments during iPSC-CM differentiation related to non-cardiac processes , such as skin development , epithelial cell differentiation and sex determination ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3 , Supplementary file 5 and 6 ) . These data show that PCHi-C accurately captured tissue-specific interactions and indicate that compartmentalization of genes in spatially regulated regions of the nucleus may be one mechanism to ensure tissue-specific gene expression ( Dixon et al . , 2015 ) . In summary , our analyses demonstrated that CM promoter interactions recapitulate key features of cardiac gene regulation and function , validating the CM map as an important tool to investigate CVD genetics . A particularly relevant application of high-resolution promoter interaction maps is to guide post-GWAS studies by identifying the target genes of disease-associated variants . We employed this approach to link GWAS SNPs for several major cardiovascular diseases to their target gene ( s ) using the CM interaction map . We compiled 524 lead SNPs from the NHGRI database ( https://www . ebi . ac . uk/gwas/ ) for three important classes of CVDs: cardiac arrhythmias , heart failure , and myocardial infarction ( Table 1 , Supplementary files 7 and 8 ) . Because of linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) patterns , the true causal SNP could be any SNP in high LD with the lead variant . Therefore , we expanded this set of SNPs to include all variants in high LD ( r2\u00a0>0 . 9 , within 50 kb of lead SNP ) , increasing the number of putatively causal variants to 10 , 475 ( hereafter called LD SNPs ) . We found that 1999 ( 19% ) of the LD SNPs were located in promoter-distal MboI fragments that interacted with the promoters of 347 genes in CMs ( Supplementary file 8 ) , hereafter referred to as target genes . The majority ( 89% ) of LD SNP-target gene pairs were located within the same TAD , with a median distance of 185 kb between each SNP-target gene pair ( Figure 5A ) . Importantly , 90 . 4% of SNP-target gene interactions skipped at least one gene promoter and 42% of SNPs interacted with at least two different promoters ( Figure 5B ) . To confirm that the CM PCHi-C interactions linked SNPs to CVD-relevant target genes , we performed GO analysis and found that target genes were highly and specifically enriched for biological processes related to cardiac function , such as membrane repolarization and cardiac conduction ( Figure 5C , left panel and Supplementary file 5 and 6 ) . As a control , we used iPSC interactions to link the same SNPs to target genes and observed a completely different set of unrelated biological processes for these genes ( Figure 5C , right panel ) . To further characterize the biological relevance of target genes , we mined mouse knock-out data from the Mouse Genome Informatics ( MGI ) database ( Blake et al . , 2017 ) , which revealed that a statistically significant number of target genes resulted in a cardiovascular phenotype when knocked-out in the mouse ( 78 genes ( 22 . 4% ) , p=1 \u00d7 10\u22125 , Figure 5D ) . Finally , we examined expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTL ) data from human left ventricle ( LV ) tissue obtained as part of the Genotype-Tissue Expresion ( GTEx ) Project ( Carithers et al . , 2015 ) and found that of the 1999 LD SNPs in interactions , 410 ( 20 . 5% ) corresponded to LV eQTLs; in comparison , only 12 . 2% of the full set of LD SNPs corresponded to LV eQTLs ( p<0 . 00001 , Figure 5E ) . We next assessed whether eQTLs loop to their associated gene . For this analysis , we considered the full set of LV eQTLs , as the 410 LD SNP eQTLs represent too small of a proportion of the full set ( <0 . 1% of all LV eQTLs ) to fully ascertain significance . On a genome-wide level , LV eQTLs in promoter-distal interactions were significantly more likely to loop to their associated gene than expected by chance ( p<0 . 00001 , Figure 5F , left panel ) . Importantly , this significance decreased when LV eQTLs were analyzed with iPSC promoter interactions ( p=0 . 035 , Figure 5F , right panel ) . Taken together , these results indicate that CM promoter interactions identify a subset of disease-relevant SNPs most likely to be functional and support the use of the CM map to assign distal CVD-associated SNPs to putative target genes . Based on an enrichment of target genes with known cardiac function , we next assessed whether expression level is an informative metric to further prioritize functional follow-up studies . We examined the expression level of the 347 target genes and found that they were moderately over-expressed in CMs compared to iPSCs ( median log2 fold change\u00a0=\u00a01 . 08 , mean log2 fold change\u00a0=\u00a01 . 44 , mean TPM values were 40 . 6 in iPSCs and 60 . 1 in CMs , p=0 . 12 , Figure 6A and B ) . Although not significant , this result reflects the enrichment of known cardiac-related genes that interact with CVD loci . However , because a subset of target genes was over-expressed in iPSCs relative to CMs ( Figure 6C ) , we predicted that gene expression level alone may be an insufficient metric to gauge the relevance of target genes to CVD biology . Indeed , we found that 21 of the 78 target genes ( 27% ) that cause cardiovascular phenotypes when knocked-out in mice were overexpressed in iPSCs compared to CMs ( Supplementary file 8 ) . This result indicates that putatively causal genes may not appear as obvious candidates based solely on gene expression data . To illustrate this point , we highlight two genes: TBX5 , a gene directly linked to cardiac arrhythmia ( Figure 6D ) ( Smemo et al . , 2012; Arnolds et al . , 2012 ) , and LITAF , a gene that , until recently , had no obvious role in cardiac biology ( Moshal et al . , 2017 ) ( Figure 6E ) . Both genes formed long-range interactions to LD SNPs identified in arrhythmia GWAS , making both genes candidate functional targets of the GWAS associations . TBX5 , which is over-expressed in CMs ( Figure 6C ) , is the most likely target gene of the LD SNPs nearby based on the interaction data but also because of its known role in directing proper development of the cardiac conduction system . LITAF , on the other hand , was over-expressed in iPSCs compared to CMs ( Figure 6C ) and was not known to contribute to cardiac function until a recent study identified this gene as a regulator of cardiac excitation in zebrafish hearts ( Moshal et al . , 2017 ) . Because the three disease classes that we analyzed represent diverse pathologies , we predicted that the target genes identified for each class individually may relate to different biological processes . Specifically , we considered that cardiac arrhythmias \u2013 which directly result from defects in cardiomyocytes specialized for electrical conduction \u2013 may uncover the most cardiac-relevant target genes compared to heart failure and myocardial infarction , two CVDs that also involve non-cardiac systems . When broken down into the respective disease classes , we confirmed that the majority of the GO enrichment for cardiac terms was driven by the cardiac arrhythmia SNPs ( Figure 7A ) , with terms directly related to the cardiac conduction system . Myocardial infarction ( Figure 7B ) and heart failure ( Figure 7C ) analyses uncovered a set of genes that were slightly enriched for regulation of growth and morphogenesis , respectively . Despite these seemingly non-specific processes , each set of target genes contained important disease-relevant candidates . For example , one of the strongest associations for myocardial infarction lies in-between the CELSR2 and PSRC1 genes on chromosome 1p13 , but a careful screen of genes whose expression was affected by the risk allele implicated the more distal SORT1 gene ( Musunuru et al . , 2010 ) . SORT1 encodes a sorting receptor that is expressed in many tissues and has been shown to act in the liver to regulate cholesterol levels ( Petersen et al . , 1997; Musunuru et al . , 2010 ) . Despite functioning in the liver , we identified multiple promoter interactions between SORT1 and the myocardial infarction GWAS locus in CMs ( Figure 7D ) , directly implicating SORT1 as the target gene and lending further support to experimental validation of this locus as a SORT1 enhancer ( Musunuru et al . , 2010 ) . Additionally , the ACTA2 gene is located 220 kb away from the heart failure GWAS locus proximal to the CH25H and LIPA genes on chromosome 10q21 ( Smith et al . , 2010 ) ( Figure 7E ) . ACTA2 encodes the smooth muscle cell-specific actin protein and mutations in this gene have been shown to cause coronary artery disease , among other vascular diseases ( Guo et al . , 2009 ) . Despite its location at a considerable distance from the GWAS association , chromatin interactions provide an important level of evidence that ACTA2 is a putative causal gene in the development of heart failure . Therefore , the CM interaction map is not only useful to interrogate diseases directly related to cardiomyocytes , as in the case of cardiac arrhythmias , but also aids interpretation of target genes that may act in non-cardiac tissues . \n Gene regulation by distant regulatory elements involves the bridging of linearly separated DNA sequences , for example between a promoter and its distal enhancers , through chromatin looping mechanisms ( Spitz and Furlong , 2012 ) . In support of this model , we report an enrichment of tissue-defining transcription factor motifs in the distally interacting sequences of differentially expressed promoters both for CMs and iPSCs , providing an important level of evidence to validate the functional relevance of iPSC and CM interactions . One explanation for this enrichment is that our interaction maps are high resolution . We generated Hi-C libraries with the 4 bp cutter MboI , which generates fragments with an average size of 422 bp; this increased specificity of the captured region likely leads to better resolution of the underlying enhancer sequence and , consequently , increased power to detect short transcription factor binding motifs . The majority of capture Hi-C studies to date have reported that gene expression level correlates with enrichment for various histone marks . We observed the same trend in our data , with highly expressed genes exhibiting strong enrichment for looping to distal H3K4me1 and H3K27ac-marked regions , and lowly expressed genes exhibiting strong enrichment for looping to H3K27me3-marked regions . These data are consistent with a model in which the number of long-range interactions to enhancers or repressors additively contributes to gene expression level ( Schoenfelder et al . , 2015; Javierre et al . , 2016 ) . The forces that drive increased association between promoters and distal cis-regulatory elements are not completely understood and have been topics of investigation in the genome organization and chromatin biology fields for several years ( Dekker and Mirny , 2016; Calo and Wysocka , 2013 ) . One possibility is that this increasing enrichment is driven by genomic compartmentalization of active and inactive chromatin . We showed that a gene\u2019s expression level correlates with the number of histone ChIP-seq peaks within a large window ( 300 kb ) surrounding each promoter . Thus , highly expressed genes are more likely to contact active chromatin regions compared to lowly expressed genes , corresponding to the observed increasing enrichment of contacts and expression we and others have reported . This local increase in active or repressive chromatin may be one driving force underlying the expression level-dependent increase in association between promoters and cis-regulatory elements , akin to a phase separation-mediated model of enhancer-promoter interactions ( Hnisz et al . , 2017 ) . We demonstrated several ways in which promoter interaction data can be used to better understand disease genetics , specifically addressing the major requirement for a high-resolution map of the gene-regulatory network in human cardiomyocytes . Although iPSC-derived CMs are known to be relatively immature and do not fully reflect the diverse structural and functional aspects of adult cardiac cells ( Gherghiceanu et al . , 2011; Karakikes et al . , 2015 ) , the difficulty in obtaining pure sub-populations of primary cardiomyocytes with high integrity necessitates the use of an in vitro system . We showed that the CMs used in this study were highly pure and recapitulate known gene regulatory properties of primary cardiomyocytes . Because of this purity , we were able to integrate CVD-associated SNPs with CM promoter interactions with high confidence , assigning nearly 20% of the variants in high LD with these associations to 347 target genes . Supporting the physiological relevance of CMs to the cardiac conduction system , we found that target genes were most relevant for GWAS loci associated with cardiac arrhythmias , in line with previous findings in immune cells that many target gene interactions were unique to relevant immune cell subtypes ( Javierre et al . , 2016; Mumbach et al . , 2017 ) . Our data also revealed that even for diseases whose etiology involves cell types other than cardiomyocytes , such as myocardial infarction and heart failure , we identified interactions involving loci associated with these diseases that recapitulate the enhancer-promoter interactions in non-cardiac cell types . As an example , we showed that a validated myocardial infarction locus interacts with the distal SORT1 promoter in CMs even though this locus has been extensively characterized in the context of cholesterol metabolism in hepatocytes . Therefore , the promoter interactions we observe linking the disease locus to SORT1 may represent tissue-invariant genome architecture , likely reflecting that genome organization in general is relatively stable ( Dixon et al . , 2015; Jin et al . , 2013; Ghavi-Helm et al . , 2014 ) . While we advocate the use of the CM map for investigating gene regulatory mechanisms of diseases related to cardiomyocyte biology , we also emphasize that , where identified , any interaction between a promoter and a putative disease-associated genomic region serves as an important level of evidence to prioritize that gene for future follow-up studies . The PCHi-C technique holds great promise to identify with high resolution and throughput all gene regulatory elements in any tissue or developmental stage of interest . However , due to technical and biological limitations , there are important caveats to PCHi-C that should be considered when interpreting the iPSC or CM interaction data . The most important caveat is that there are likely to be many false negatives , or \u2018missing\u2019 interactions . Although the capture step greatly enriches for promoter-containing ligation fragments in a Hi-C library , the total landscape of promoter contacts in a population of cells is still under-sampled , even with a sequencing depth of\u00a0~400M reads per replicate conducted for this study . This is due to several factors , including the hybridization efficiency of each bait , ability to design sufficient baits per promoter , and the transient nature of many regulatory interactions . This latter issue is confounded by the distance-dependent effect on ligation frequency: as the distance between two fragments increases , the read-depth required to robustly identify that interaction also increases . The feasibility of deeper sequencing and modifications to computational pipelines will continue to improve the coverage and resolution of Hi-C data . Additionally , because the CHiCAGO program does not incorporate TAD boundaries into its background model , it may slightly underestimate the expected number of reads corresponding to intra-TAD interactions which could lead to potential false positives . However , we note that there is a strong correspondence between TADs called on pre-capture Hi-C data and PCHi-C interactions identified with CHiCAGO ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A ) ; this suggests that accounting for TAD boundaries may only marginally improve our ability to identify significant interactions . A final consideration is the interpretation of interactions involving inactive genes . Although most regulatory elements are thought of as activating , it is possible that long-range interactions may also contribute to gene silencing; this is supported by the observation that silent genes are enriched for long-range interactions to H3K27me3 marked regions ( Figure 3D ) . Alternatively , silent genes may contact regulatory elements that are not active in the analyzed cell type or developmental stage; these may represent \u2018pre-formed\u2019 loops between genes and their regulatory elements as characterized in Ghavi-Helm et al . ( 2014 ) . Despite these limitations , the data sets we provide here represent a highly enriched set of\u00a0~350 , 000 and~400 , 000 promoter interactions in iPSC and CMs , respectively; although there are likely missing interactions , the interactions that we did identify should be considered as very high confidence , as they were independently identified in at least two biological replicates and show strong signal of enrichment for known features of genome architecture and gene regulation . In conclusion , the promoter interaction maps we generated in this study represent important resources for any investigation into the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease traits . The list of candidate regulatory variants and their target genes may serve as an entry point for several hypotheses related to CVD GWAS , and can be readily tested in experimental settings . To provide both the iPSC and CM maps as an accessible resource , we have hosted the full set of data presented in this study as a public track hub at the WashU EpiGenome Browser ( Zhou et al . , 2015 ) , accessible at the following link: http://epigenomegateway . wustl . edu/browser/ ? genome=hg19&publichub=Lindsey . Additionally , we provide the significant PCHi-C interaction files used in all analyses in the Supplementary Material ( Supplementary files 1 and 2 ) ; these can be applied to future multi-omics analyses of gene regulation and disease genetics . \n We used the Yoruban iPSC line 19101 , kindly provided by the laboratory of Yoav Gilad . This iPSC line was reprogrammed from lymphoblastoid cells as part of a previous study , where it was shown to differentiate into all three germ layers , displayed a normal karyotype , and expressed markers characteristic of pluripotency ( Banovich et al . , 2018 ) . iPSCs were grown in Essential 8 ( E8 ) Medium ( Thermo Fisher #A1517001 ) supplemented with 1X Penicillin-Streptomycin ( Pen/Strep , Gibco ) on Matrigel-coated tissue culture dishes ( Corning #354277 ) . Cells were passaged when they were\u00a0~80% confluent using enzyme-free dissociation solution ( 30 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 1X PBS minus Magnesium and Calcium ) and maintained in E8 Medium with 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 dihydrochloride ( Abcam #ab120129 ) for 24 hr . Medium was replaced daily . iPSC cultures routinely tested negative for mycoplasma contamination using the Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit ( ATCC #30\u20131012K ) . Cardiomyocyte differentiations were based on the protocol of Burridge et al . ( 2014 ) with modifications described in Banovich et al . ( Banovich et al . , 2018 ) . iPSCs were expanded in 60 mm dishes in E8 media until they reached 60\u201370% confluency at which time the differentiation was started ( day 0 ) . On day 0 , E8 media was replaced with 10 mL of basic heart media/12 \u03bcM GSK-3 inhibitor CHIR-99021 trihydrochloride ( Tocris #4953 ) /Matrigel overlay [basic heart media: RPMI 1640 minus L-glutamine ( HyClone #SH30096 . 01 ) with 1X GlutaMax ( Life Technologies #11879020 ) supplemented with 1X B27 minus insulin ( Thermo Fisher #A1895601 ) and 1X Pen/Strep; Matrigel overlay was accomplished by dissolving Matrigel in 50 mL basic heart media at a concentration of 0 . 5X according to the lot-specific dilution factor] . After 24 hr ( day 1 ) , the GSK-3 inhibitor was removed by replacing media with 10 mL basic heart media . On day 3 , media was replaced with 10 mL basic heart media supplemented with 2 \u03bcM Wnt-C59 ( Tocris #5148 ) . On day 5 ( 48 hours later ) , media was replaced with 10 mL basic heart media . On day 7 , cells were washed once with 1X PBS and then 15 mL basic heart media was added . Media was replaced every other day in this way until day 15 at which time cardiomyocytes were selected for by replacing basic heart media with 10 mL lactate media ( RPMI 1640 minus D-glucose , plus L-glutamine ( Life Technologies #11879020 ) , supplemented with 0 . 5 mg/mL recombinant human albumin ( Sigma 70024-90-7 ) , 5 mM sodium DL-lactate ( Sigma 72-17-3 ) , 213 \u03bcg/mL L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate ( Sigma 70024-90-7 ) and 1X Pen/Strep ) . Lactate media was replaced every other day until day 20 at which point cardiomyocytes were harvested . Cells from successful differentiations exhibited spontaneous beating around days 7\u201310 . Cardiomyocytes were harvested by washing once with 1X PBS followed by incubation in 4 mL TrypLE ( Life Technologies 12604\u2013021 ) at 37\u00b0C for 5 min . After incubation , 4 mL lactate media was added to the TrypLE and a 1 mL pipet was used to dislodge cells . Cells were strained once with a 100 \u03bcM strainer and then once with a 40 \u03bcM strainer . Cells were pelleted at 500xg and then resuspended in PBS and counted . For each batch of differentiation , 5 million cells were taken for promoter-capture Hi-C and 1 million cells were taken for RNA-seq . To assess purity , 2 million cells were taken for flow cytometry analysis using an antibody for cardiac Troponin T ( BD Biosciences 564767 ) . All cells used in downstream experiments were at least 86% Troponin T positive ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . We carried out three independent differentiations of the same iPSC line and generated promoter-capture Hi-C and RNA-seq libraries in iPSCs and CMs from each triplicate . We used HiCUP v0 . 5 . 9 ( Wingett et al . , 2015 ) to align and filter Hi-C reads ( total and filtered read counts are presented in Supplementary file 9 . 2 ) . Unique reads were given to CHiCAGO version 1 . 2 . 0 ( Cairns et al . , 2016 ) and significant interactions were called with default parameters . In this study , we focused exclusively on cis-interactions as the evidence that trans-chromosomal interactions contribute to gene expression regulation is limited . CHiCAGO reports interactions for each captured restriction fragment; to summarize interactions by gene , we considered the interval spanning all captured fragments ( i . e . the set of probes spanning each TSS ) as the promoter region ( \u2018merged TSS\u2019 ) . This means the promoter regions created have variable lengths . In cases where multiple genes were annotated to the same promoter region , we report the interaction for each gene individually . This annotation allowed us to perform gene-level analyses , for example based on expression level . We removed this redundancy as necessary , for example in motif enrichment analyses of the promoter-interacting fragments . Using the \u2018merged TSS\u2019 interaction files , we filtered interactions to retain those that mapped within 1 kb of each other in at least two replicates . Specifically , we extended each promoter-interacting fragment by 1 kb on each end and then used BEDTools ( Quinlan and Hall , 2010 ) pairToPair functionality to identify interactions where both ends matched across replicates . To identify cell type-specific interactions , we required that the interaction ( with the 1 kb extension ) was not present in any of the three replicates of the other cell type . The number of read-pairs per promoter and the corresponding number of significant interactions identified is presented in Supplementary file 9 . 3 . The TAD analyses , motif enrichment , ChIP-seq peak enrichment , and eQTL analyses ( related to Figures 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 ) were conducted with fragment-level interactions ( no 1 kb extension ) . The GWAS SNP analyses were conducted with 1kb-extended interactions , as we aimed to be as inclusive as possible when linking CVD SNPs to target genes . PCHi-C interactions , TADs , RNA-seq , publicly available ChIP-seq , and GWAS SNPs are hosted by the WashU EpiGenome Browser ( Zhou et al . , 2015 ) as a public track hub . This can be accessed by going to http://epigenomegateway . wustl . edu/browser/ . The public hub ( \u2018A promoter interaction map for cardiovascular disease genetics\u2019 ) can be found under the Human Hg19 browser . To generate the by-gene read counts displayed in the genome-browser figures , all read-pairs mapping to captured MboI fragments for a given promoter were summed across replicates . Specifically , we summed reads for each MboI fragment where the read was part of a paired-read that mapped to a bait for the given gene . The arcs that are displayed underneath the 4C-style plot represent significant interactions that were identified in at least two replicates as detailed above in \u2018Interaction calling\u2019 . To identify TADs , we pooled reads across replicates for each cell type using the pre-capture Hi-C data ( 600M reads for iPSC and 733M reads for CM ) and used HiCUP v0 . 5 . 9 ( Wingett et al . , 2015 ) to align and filter Hi-C reads . HOMER v4 . 8 . 3 ( Heinz et al . , 2010 ) was used to generate normalized interaction matrices at a resolution of 40 kb and then TopDom v0 . 0 . 2 ( Shin et al . , 2016 ) was used with a window size w\u00a0=\u00a010 to identify topological domains , boundaries and gaps . We only considered domains for the analyses in this paper . We considered a promoter capture Hi-C interaction to be \u2018intra-TAD\u2019 if the entire span of the interaction was fully contained in a single domain . \u2018Inter-TAD\u2019 interactions are defined as interactions where each end maps to a different domain . The program runHiCpca . pl from the HOMER ( Heinz et al . , 2010 ) v4 . 8 . 3 package was used to call A/B compartments with -res 50000 for both whole-genome and capture Hi-C data . Total RNA was extracted from flash-frozen pellets of 1 million cells using TRI Reagent ( Sigma #T9424 ) and a homogenizer followed by RNA isolation and clean-up using the Direct-zol RNA Kit ( Zymo Research #11\u2013331 ) . RNA-seq libraries were generated with the Illumina TruSeq V2 kit ( Illumina , RS-122\u20132001 ) and 1 \u03bcg of RNA , following manufacturer\u2019s instructions . Libraries were made from RNA isolated from three independent iPSC-CM differentiations ( triplicates of iPSC and of cardiomyocytes ) . Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 . Gene counts were quantified with Salmon 0 . 7 . 2 ( Patro et al . , 2017 ) and imported with tximport 1 . 2 . 0 ( Soneson et al . , 2015 ) into DESeq2 1 . 12 . 4 ( Love et al . , 2014 ) to call differentially expressed genes . A minimum 1 . 5-fold-difference between CMs and iPSC triplicates and a minimum adjusted p-value of 0 . 05 were required to select differentially expressed genes for downstream analyses . TPMs ( transcripts per million ) were also estimated by Salmon . Because the samples clearly clustered according to their known tissues of origin ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A ) , no correction for batch effects was performed . We performed ChIP-seq on 2 . 5 million cells each for iPSCs and CMs using H3K27ac antibodies ( Wako #306\u201334849 ) . Briefly , cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature , quenched with 0 . 2M glycine for 5 min , pelleted and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen . Cells were lysed in Lysis Buffer 1 ( 50 mM HEPES-KOH , pH 7 . 5 , 140 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 10% glycerol , 0 . 5% NP-40 , 0 . 25% Triton X-100 ) . Crosslinked chromatin was sheared to an average size of 300 bp using a Bioruptor with 30\" on/30\" off at high setting and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 1 \u03bcg antibody . Dynabeads M-280 Sheep Anti-Mouse IgG ( ThermoFisher #11201D ) were used to pull down chromatin and ChIP DNA was eluted and prepared for sequencing using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library prep kit ( NEB #E7645S ) . ChIP-seq reads were aligned with Bowtie 2\u20132 . 2 . 3 ( Langmead and Salzberg , 2012 ) and peaks were called with HOMER ( Heinz et al . , 2010 ) v4 . 8 . 3 on unique reads with mapping quality\u00a0>10 using the \u2013region and \u2013style histone parameters . Significant peaks were overlapped with H3K27ac peaks from Epigenome Roadmap samples which demonstrated high concordance between matched tissue types ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C , D ) . Because we performed a low level of sequencing , we did not identify as many peaks as the Roadmap samples . Therefore , we used Roadmap ChIP-seq data in all of our analyses . The human Gene Ontology ( GO ) associations of GO terms ( Ashburner et al . , 2000 ) to genes and the GO database were downloaded on January 22 , 2016 from http://geneontology . org/gene-associations . GO terms were associated with RefSeq genes via gene symbols . Using the GO annotation graph , all parent terms were assigned to the terms annotated to a gene . A hypergeometric test was used to calculate the statistical significance of the difference of the number of genes associated with a given GO term in a particular gene set and the universe of all RefSeq genes ( p<0 . 05 ) . p-Values were corrected with the R package p . adjust function using the \u2018fdr\u2019 method . For two of the GWAS disease groups ( heart failure and myocardial infarction ) , the list of genes looping to LD SNPs included many histone genes . This is because there is a tag SNP located in the middle of a histone gene cluster ( containing\u00a0>30 histone genes located close together ) in each case . After expanding the tag SNP to all SNPs in LD , many of the histone genes in that cluster looped to the LD SNPs , resulting in a high representation of these genes in the final gene list . The resulting Gene Ontology enrichment analysis gave terms relating to nucleosome and chromatin organization because of this over-representation . We therefore chose to remove these genes from the final gene lists of heart failure and myocardial infarction target genes . The program findMotifsGenome . pl from the HOMER ( Heinz et al . , 2010 ) v4 . 8 . 3 package was used with \u2013size given parameter to identify overrepresented motifs in the distal ( non-promoter ) interacting sequences of promoter interactions . As stated above , this analysis was performed on fragment-level promoter-interacting sequences . We obtained publicly available ChIP-seq data in the form of processed peak calls for H3K27ac , H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project ( Kundaje et al . , 2015 ) , and for CTCF from ENCODE ( ENCODE Project Consortium , 2012 ) ( Supplementary file 10 ) . We only considered peaks that mapped outside of the captured region of promoters to ensure our results were not driven by the strong peak signal over most promoters . As a proxy for iPSCs , we used data from the H1 embryonic stem cell line and for CMs we used data from Left Ventricle tissue . We grouped genes into five expression categories based on the average TPM values: group 1 ( 0 TPM ) , group 2 ( TPM 0\u20133 ) , group 3 ( TPM 3\u201325 ) , group 4 ( TPM 25\u2013150 ) and group 5 ( TPM\u00a0>150 ) and for each group of genes , we calculated the enrichment for promoter interactions to overlap a given feature . To calculate enrichment of interactions overlapping an epigenetic feature , we compared the observed proportion of MboI fragments in significant interactions overlapping a feature to the proportion of random MboI fragments overlapping the feature . Specifically , we randomly selected MboI fragments from a set that excluded fragments mapping within captured regions ( promoters ) or within unmappable genomic regions ( gaps ) . The number of randomly selected fragments matched the number of interacting fragments considered for the analysis . We performed 100 iterations of overlapping random fragments with a feature and report the average fold-enrichment . We refer to this method of enrichment as a \u2018genome-wide\u2019 background model because for each gene expression group , the observed proportion of fragments containing a peak is compared to randomly selected fragments from the whole genome . To calculate the correlation between expression and histone ChIP-seq peak density , we calculated the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation between the expression value for each gene ( the average TPM value ) and the number of peaks mapping within 300 kb of each gene TSS . We only considered genes with at least one significant interaction in the respective cell type to allow for generalizations to the enrichment analysis presented in Figure 3 . We compiled genome-wide significant SNPs associated with GWAS for cardiac arrhythmia , heart failure , and myocardial infarction from the NHGRI-EBI database ( http://www . ebi . ac . uk/gwas/ ) ; see Supplementary file 7 for list of terms used to identify specific GWAS . We expanded each set of SNPs to all SNPs in high LD ( r2\u00a0>0 . 9 ) using phase 3 data of the 1000 genomes project ( Nikpay et al . , 2015 ) ( Supplementary file 3 ) . For each lead SNP from the GWAS we analyzed , we selected a 100 kb interval centered on the SNP ( SNP\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050 kb ) . For each 100 kb interval , Tabix ( Li , 2011 ) was used to retrieve genotypes . We then used PLINK ( Purcell et al . , 2007 ) v1 . 90p on phase three data from the 1000 genomes project ( Nikpay et al . , 2015 ) ( ftp . 1000genomes . ebi . ac . uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502 , v5a ) to select SNPs in LD ( r2\u00a0>0 . 9 ) with the tag SNP and a minimum allele frequency of 0 . 01 . We only included the populations primarily studied in the GWASs: CEU ( central European ) , ASW ( African American ) and JPT ( Japanese ) . We assigned all SNPs in promoter-distal interactions to their interacting gene ( s ) ( \u2018target genes\u2019 ) using cardiomyocyte promoter capture Hi-C data . We did not require the SNP to map to regions associated with open chromatin or enhancer marks as these types of data are highly cell-type specific and we did not wish to exclude SNPs in regions that may be active in non-assayed cell types . We note that one major GWAS for dilated cardiomyopathy was not included in the NHGRI-EBI database ( Meder et al . , 2014 ) , likely because there is an error obtaining the online methods of the paper . After careful inspection of the study , we concluded that the GWAS met the NHGRI-EBI criteria and included the associations from that study in our analysis . A complete list of all studies used in this analysis can be found in Supplementary file 8 . To calculate enrichment of target genes to cause cardiovascular phenotypes when deleted in mice ( Mouse Genome Informatics database ) , we randomly selected 347 genes from the list of starting genes ( i . e . genes with at least one promoter-distal interaction in CMs , meaning it could be a target gene ) , and calculated the proportion that caused a cardiovascular phenotype in mice . We performed this randomized selection for 1000 iterations to generate the randomized ( expected ) values . Random genes were not required to be expressed , as the set of target genes contains genes that are not expressed . p-Value was calculated with a Z test . For eQTLs used in comparisons with GWAS variants and Hi-C interactions , we used the set of GTEx v7 eQTLs identified as significant in the left ventricle of the heart ( Carithers et al . , 2015 ) . eQTLs were called significant if q\u00a0<\u00a00 . 05 after false discovery rate correction ( Storey and Tibshirani , 2003 ) . We only considered promoter-distal eQTLs that were at least 10 kb from their associated gene to allow for that eQTL to map to an interaction with it\u2019s associated gene . To calculate enrichment for eQTLs to loop to their associated gene , we used a background model whereby each promoter\u2019s set of interactions were re-mapped to a different promoter , keeping the distance and strand orientation consistent . We performed this re-mapping of all promoter interactions 1000 times and calculated the proportion of all eQTLs that mapped to interactions for their eQTL-associated gene in each permutation . We either used the CM interactions or the iPSC interactions with the same set of left ventricle eQTLs to compare cell-type specificity of the promoter interaction data .

Wasps , for instance , are armed with a harmful sting and advertise this fact via their distinctive yellow and black stripes . Predators often learn to heed such warnings and avoid these unpalatable animals in future . As a result , animals that mimic another animal\u2019s warning signals can reap the benefit of being left alone by predators even if they are otherwise undefended . Textbooks on evolution are typically full of different examples of mimicry . However , the specifics of these examples are often poorly understood . Ninety years ago a famous Australian entomologist , Alexander Nicholson , suggested the existence of large groups of mimics in the Australian wildlife . More of these so-called \u201cmimetic complexes\u201d have recently been recognized among several species of insect , but not previously in ants . Now , Pek\u00e1r et al . have looked at all known ants and ant-like mimics in Australia and discovered over 140 species that use gold and black colours as a warning signal . Most of the species were ants , but the collection of mimics also includes wasps , spiders , true bugs and insects called treehoppers . Some of the mimics were less palatable than others , and they possessed a range of defences , including spines and foul-tasting chemicals . Pek\u00e1r et al . then looked in the guts of 12 species of predators in the wild , and found that very few of them ate the mimics . When mimics were offered to three different predators ( specifically a lizard and two species of spider ) , most avoided the mimics regardless of whether they were palatable or unpalatable . Instead , the predators preferred to eat a spider that was not a member of the group of mimics because it lacked the gold colouration . Further studies are now needed to continue to document the details of this and other mimetic complexes . For example , this includes revealing how the different defences protect the members of the complex from predators do not use vision to recognize their prey and so cannot see the warning colouration . All this is needed to understand evolutionary processes that have fascinated biologists for decades , and explain how such large mimetic complexes evolved and persisted in spite of the influence of the community of predators .", "source": "Mimicry complexes typically consist of multiple species that deter predators using similar anti-predatory signals . Mimics in these complexes are assumed to vary in their level of defence from highly defended through to moderately defended , or not defended at all . Here , we report a new multi-order mimicry complex that includes at least 140 different putative mimics from four arthropod orders including ants , wasps , bugs , tree hoppers and spiders . All members of this mimicry complex are characterised by a conspicuous golden body and an ant Gestalt , but vary substantially in their defensive traits . However , they were similarly effective at deterring predators - even mildly defended mimics were rarely eaten by a community of invertebrate and vertebrate predators both in the wild and during staged trials . We propose that despite the predominance of less defended mimics the three predatory guilds avoid the mimics because of the additive influence of the various defensive traits . \n Mimicry complexes ( i . e . a composite of several M\u00fcllerian and Batesian mimics ) have long fascinated biologists for the theoretical and empirical challenges they pose . Classic M\u00fcllerian mimicry was thought to only include equally defended species ( M\u00fcller , 1878 ) , while Batesian mimicry ( Bates , 1862 ) describes undefended species resembling defended models . In reality , this simplistic dichotomy ( sensu Speed , 1999 ) represents the end-points of a mimetic spectrum that contains species that vary in their mimetic fidelity and/or their degree of defensiveness . A topic of considerable debate ( Sherratt , 2008 ) is the putative influence that moderately defended mimics have on the stability of mimicry rings ( i . e . a composite of several similar M\u00fcllerian mimics ) . Discrepancy in protection between two mimetic species may dilute the protection of a more defended species ( Speed , 1999 ) . Great tits ( Parus major , Paridae , Passeriformes ) for instance , attacked artificial models more often when less defended mimics were frequently encountered and food was restricted ( Rowland et al . , 2010 ) . In direct contrast , associative learning mechanisms predict a mutualistic relationship between moderately and highly defended members of the ring ( Rowland et al . , 2007 ) : wild caught great tits equally avoided four species of true bugs with varying levels of defence but which shared similar warning colours ( Hodov\u00e1 Sv\u00e1dov\u00e1 et al . , 2013 ) . M\u00fcllerian mimicry rings typically consist of a few closely related species ( Symula et al . , 2001; Williams , 2007; Alexandrou et al . , 2011 ) , with the exceptions of the species-rich mutillid wasp ( Wilson et al . , 2012 , 2015 ) , Heliconius butterfly ( Mallet and Gilbert , 1995 ) and bumblebee ( Williams , 2007 ) complexes . These complexes , despite being speciose , are taxonomically limited because their members often belong to only a single family or genus ( Lepidoptera or Hymenoptera ) . The mutillid wasp complex is suspected of including species from other orders but this has not been formally presented ( Wilson et al . , 2012 , 2015 ) . A mathematical model suggests that mimicry complexes should be common in multispecies communities with distantly related taxa ( Beatty et al . , 2004 ) . The general lack of data on multi-order mimicry complexes may represent an observer bias . For example , ants have been largely overlooked as M\u00fcllerian mimics , yet they are diverse , typically well defended through a range of defensive measures including a sting , noxious chemicals , spines , a thickened cuticle , mandibles and communal attack ( H\u00f6lldobler and Wilson , 1990 ) . There is also a rich diversity of invertebrate taxa that mimic ants . Species within M\u00fcllerian rings thus far described use the same defensive traits . Heliconius butterflies , for instance , rely on their distastefulness while mutillid wasps have a venomous sting . The degree of distastefulness or level of venom toxicity within a mimicry ring is expected to vary among members . Experimental investigations , that started a hundred years ago ( e . g . McAtee , 1912 , 1932 ) , have tended to focus on a single visually-oriented predatory guild and yet most environments contain a wide range of potential predators of mimics . For example , species that mimic ants may encounter several ant-averse and ant-eating predators ( Pek\u00e1r et al . , 2011 ) . In some microhabitats , such as leaf litter , the ant-eating predators ( which often use chemical cues to recognise prey ) and ant-adverse nonvisually-orienting predators are indeed more common than visually-orienting ones , thus exerting strong selection pressure on mimics to signal their unpalatability in sensory modalities other than visual . Thus one of the major outstanding questions regarding the contribution of mimics to the function of mimetic rings is evaluating the success of M\u00fcllerian and/or Batesian mimicry by analysing the selection pressure exerted by all predators in a given environment ( Blumstein , 2006 ) . Here , we describe a novel diverse and species rich mimicry complex consisting of golden ant , wasp , true bug , treehopper , and spider mimics and we investigate hypotheses concerning their unpalatability and resulting efficacy against predation . Mimetic complexes are often composed of rings \u2013 groups of species that draw advantages from similar aposematic signals ( Williams , 2007; Wilson et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , our first step was the identification of separate rings to understand how the mimicry complex evolved and is reinforced . We therefore tested whether the rings have a sympatric distribution , which would indicate a mutualistic relationship between mimics and whether mimics within a ring share common ancestry . Our second step was to quantify the relationship between the proposed aposematic signal ( golden/black colouration ) and the level of noxiousness or distastefulness of the mimics that display the signal . Aposematic warning signals and distastefulness are expected to evolve together within a species ( e . g . Ruxton et al . , 2004 ) and thus , the strength of the distasteful stimulus should coincide with the conspicuousness of the warning signal ( Speed and Ruxton , 2007 ) . In this mimicry complex , we investigated whether there is a positive relationship between signal intensity and unpalatability across species as has recently been found among lady-bird beetles ( Mar\u00eda Arenas et al . , 2015 ) . This would mean that truly M\u00fcllerian mimics are expected to honestly signal their distastefulness but truly Batesian mimics display a conspicuous warning signal without the noxious stimulus . We tested these assumptions by correlating the size of the warning signal ( golden/back colouration ) with a measure of distastefulness derived from the sum of defences found in the mimics . Our critical third step was to extend the scope of previous studies of mimicry complexes by experimentally testing the efficacy of the aposematic signal , and indeed the validity of the M\u00fcllerian mimicry claim , through staged predator-prey trials . Based on the broad diversity of defences used by mimics in this complex , we predict that predators should learn quickly to avoid mimics ( Beatty et al . , 2004 ) , and that mimics should be protected from a range of predators . Finally , we examined how the aposematic signal and the level of defensiveness interplay with a community of predators that rely on multiple sensory modalities . Mimicry complexes are typically characterised by a distinct colour pattern and hence experiments are often biased towards visual-oriented predators and usually vertebrates . In reality , the members of a complex are exposed to predators that use a variety of sensory modalities and foraging modes to detect and subdue their prey . We combined staged predatory trials with a dietary analysis of wild populations of a community of predators to test the hypothesis that more unpalatable species are attacked less frequently by a community of predators . \n We uncovered a cross-order mimicry complex , consisting of at least 140 arthropod species including 126 ant species , seven spider species ( and several forms ) , three species of true bugs , one mutillid wasp and one treehopper ( Table 1 ) . Members of the complex are all ant-like in appearance and characterised by a dorsal patch of golden coloration combined with blackish colouration ( Figure 1 , Video 1 ) , which we recognise as an aposematic signal ( RGB contrast: mean\u00a0=\u00a0241 . 4 , SD\u00a0=\u00a058 . 1 , N\u00a0=\u00a055 ) . Related non-mimetic species are typically uniformly black or brown . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 003Table 1 .

Among the hymenopteran representatives ( ants and wasps ) , the golden sheen is generated only by pubescence of varying density ( Figure 2 ) . Consequently , this visual effect entirely disappears when they are submerged in ethanol . In contrast , true bugs and spiders use a combination of hairs and yellow pigmentation ( in the exocuticle of the abdomen/gaster ) , while the treehopper appears to use only pigment as the golden shine is lost after death . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 006Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 006 The cluster analysis suggested the\u00a0existence of ten putative rings within the complex , according to variation in the\u00a0dorsal colour pattern but the differences were rather small ( Figure 3A ) . These rings were distributed across the Australian continent with a considerable overlap . For instance , rings in the east coast of Australia overlapped where species richness was the greatest ( Figure 3B ) . However , the degree of sympatry in a ring was not related to colour pattern ( estimated from 24 measures of the colour pattern , body size and area of golden patch ) similarity ( Mantel test , r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120 . 03 , p=0 . 79 ) . We did not find a strong effect of phylogeny on the classification into rings ( GLS , Pagel\u2019s \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a00 . 22 , Figure 1 ) . All this indicates that the splitting into ten putative rings was artificial and there is only one complex . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 007Figure 3 . Mimetic rings and their distribution .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 007 We determined the unpalatability of 100 species belonging to the golden mimicry complex . Because several complementary forms of defence are likely , we estimated total unpalatability for each mimic based on the sum of morphological , chemical , and behavioural defensive traits . Our analyses uncovered a spectrum of mimics from non-defended ( Batesian ) to highly defended ( M\u00fcllerian ) species . For instance , the spider and treehopper species had the lowest unpalatability score ( i . e . sum of normalised measurements on defensive traits ) and were therefore classified as Batesian mimics . Daerlac bugs , mutillid wasps and all ant species were unpalatable , but we found considerable variation in the degree of unpalatability ranging from quasi-M\u00fcllerian to unambiguously M\u00fcllerian , mimics . The index of unpalatability had an overall normal distribution ( Shapiro-Wilk normality test , W\u00a0=\u00a00 . 98 , p=0 . 21 ) with the highest frequency consisting of moderately-palatable species . Unpalatability varied in each ring but the variation was not significantly different among the ten rings suggested previously ( Bartlett test , K26\u00a0=\u00a011 , p=0 . 09 , Figure 4A ) supporting further the\u00a0existence of only one complex . We discovered that the absolute area of the golden colouration increased with unpalatability ( controlling for the effect of phylogeny and body size: GLS , F1 , 91\u00a0=\u00a021 . 1 , p<0 . 0001 , Figure 4B ) supporting the hypothesis that the golden colour is an aposematic signal . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 008Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 008 We quantified predation of mimics by the 12 most abundant predatory species that co-occurred with 13 sympatric mimetic species belonging to the complex ( Table 2 ) . We analysed gut content or faeces of these predators ( 553 spiders , 50 skinks , and 48 birds ) , representing three different guilds , using Next Generation Sequencing , which allows identification of prey to species . We found that individuals of all predatory species were positive for primers targeting the DNA of ants , spiders , and mutillid wasps . The frequency of captured mimics was not significantly different from their availability in the environment ( X212\u00a0=\u00a01 . 5 , p=0 . 99 ) because mimics were very rare in the field . Only three mimetic species ( Camponotus aeneopilosus , Myrmarachne erythrocephala , Myrmarachne luctuosa ) were detected in the faeces/gut of predators . Visually-oriented and non-visually oriented euryphagous ( ant-adverse ) predators captured mimics at less than 4% frequency , whereas specialized ant-eating predators captured mostly Batesian mimics ( Table 2 ) . The overall attack rate estimated for all predators was marginally significantly negatively related to the unpalatability of mimics when it included two Batesian mimics ( GAM , F3 . 8 , 4 . 6 = 3 . 8 , p=0 . 045 , Figure 5A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 009Table 2 . The percentage of predator individuals found with DNA ( Next Generation Sequencing ) of mimics in their gut/faeces . The primer specific for ants amplified on average 9 . 3% individuals of predators , the primer specific for Myrmarachne spiders amplified 3 . 9% individuals of predators , and the primer specific for mutillids amplified 9 . 2% individuals of predators .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 010 We exposed five species of mimics ( ants , spiders and bugs ) of varying unpalatability ( Table 3 ) and one non-mimic ( spider ) to one representative of each of three guilds of na\u00efve predator species ( euryphagous skink , ant-adverse spider , ant specialist spider ) . Eastern water skinks ( N\u00a0=\u00a026 ) are visually-oriented generalist predators and captured ( i . e . ate ) non-mimetic spiders at significantly higher frequency than members of the mimetic complex such as ants , spiders and bugs ( GEE-b , X25\u00a0=\u00a0125 . 8 , p<0 . 0001 , Figure 6 ) . In accordance with our classification of unpalatability , we found a strong positive relationship between prey unpalatability and the post-attack response of skinks ( GLM , F1 , 4\u00a0=\u00a019 . 4 , p=0 . 012 , Figure 4C ) . Mimic or non-mimic spiders were immediately eaten , but skinks showed an adverse response to mimic ants and bugs . These prey were clearly distasteful because the skinks immediately cleaned their mouths and frequently spat the prey out . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 011Table 3 .

Capture of mimics by three predators . Comparison of frequency of attacks on five mimics and one non-mimic by skinks ( euryphagous visually-oriented predator ) ; Lampona spiders ( ant-adverse non-visually oriented predators ) , and Servaea spiders ( specialised ant-eating predators ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 012 We found similar patterns in the non-visually oriented ant-adverse Lampona spiders ( N\u00a0=\u00a025 ) , which captured non-mimic spiders significantly more frequently than all mimics ( Cochran test , X25\u00a0=\u00a0104 , p<0 . 0001 , Figure 6 ) , showing no differentiation between the mimics . By contrast , the visually oriented ant-eating specialist Servaea spiders ( N\u00a0=\u00a027 ) readily attacked and captured mimics as well as non-mimics . Although these spiders readily attacked the mimics they did appear to differentiate between their levels of defence ( attack: GEE-b , X24\u00a0=\u00a015763 , p<0 . 0001 , Figure 6 ) . The most unpalatable ant was attacked at a\u00a0significantly lower frequency than other mimics ( contrasts , p<0 . 008 ) and moderately unpalatable ant species were captured at a\u00a0significantly lower frequency than bug and spider mimics ( contrasts , p<0 . 006 ) . In summary , euryphagous and ant-adverse predators were less likely to capture a mimic than a non-mimic while the ant-specialist attacked the ants and ant-mimics alike but the likelihood of attack varied according to the mimic\u2019s actual unpalatability . There was no relationship between levels of unpalatability and the sum of predation pressure ( K-values ) exerted by the three predatory guilds ( LM , F1 , 3\u00a0=\u00a01 . 83 , p=0 . 27 , Figure 5B ) . \n Ants have not been considered in M\u00fcllerian mimetic rings , which is perhaps surprising given their diversity and the number of known ant-mimics . The lack of ant fauna in mimetic rings possibly reflects an overall lack of conspicuous defensive coloration in ants . However , our study supports a species rich mimicry complex of golden coloured ant models and mimics , adding to the small number of documented large-scale complexes . Mimetic complexes ( among several families of beetles ) were first recognised by Nicholson ( 1927 ) for Australian insect fauna . Such complexes are presumably far more widespread than appreciated , but have only been subject to more intensive study relatively recently . Many more large-scale mimetic complexes among ants and other animals ( particularly arthropods ) are likely to be described in future . The species richness of this golden complex exceeds those of fish or millipedes ( Marek and Bond , 2009; Alexandrou et al . , 2011 ) but is currently smaller than in mutillid wasp ( Wilson et al . , 2012 , 2015 ) , heliconid butterfly ( Mallet and Gilbert , 1995 ) and bumblebee ( Williams , 2007 ) complexes . The key members in the golden complex are ants but the complex is taxonomically broad and includes species with distant phylogenetic origins . Beside the species mentioned , it may include a few other groups , such as bees , flies , and cerambycid beetles , in which some species also have a golden colouration . This is in contrast to complexes of similar scale that only include members from a single order . The distribution of the majority of the ten putative mimetic rings in the complex overlapped with at least one other ring . Although the cluster analysis distinguished rings , the distances between the rings were not large suggesting that the entire complex is just a single ring . Our findings are not unlike those from other complexes that include rings of different colour pattern , which overlap in geographic distribution ( Williams , 2007; Wilson et al . , 2012 , 2015 ) . An overlap of golden rings or actually their non-existence potentially suggests that the variable golden colour patterns produce similar aposematic signals . Large mimetic complexes include taxa of close and distant phylogenetic origins ( e . g . , Linsley et al . , 1961; Rodriguez et al . , 2014 ) in which the colour pattern is not only a product of common ancestry but also of convergence . A shared ancestry is apparent for two species of Myrmarachne spiders ( Pek\u00e1r et al . , 2017 ) , three species of Daerlac bugs ( Casis and Symonds , 2012 ) , and several species of Polyrhachis ants ( Robson et al . , 2015 ) . The majority though , including Camponotus , Diacamma , Pachycondyla , and Iridomyrmex ants , other spider species , Eurymela treehopers , and Ephutomorpha wasps , have converged on the same phenotype as evidenced by their isolation within lineages of non-mimetic colour patterns . The diversity and geographic pattern of the golden phenotype is likely a result of co-divergence as found in other complexes ( e . g . , Rodriguez et al . , 2014 ) . Species in M\u00fcllerian rings described to date , e . g . heliconid butterflies , use a single defensive trait to teach predators that they are distasteful ( e . g . , Van Zandt Brower , 1958 ) . The lesser-defended individuals in this context are less distasteful . Species in our golden complex use multiple defensive traits including a variety of structural and chemical defences . To understand how these traits interplay with the aposematic signal we created an index that summed all traits known to serve a defensive function . We acknowledge this approach is somewhat simplistic as various traits are differentially effective against various predators . For example , a thick cuticle is effective against arthropod predators but ineffective against vertebrates ( Evans and Sanson , 2005 ) . On the other hand , spines are effective against vertebrates but ineffective in the defence against arthropod predators ( Mikolajewski et al . , 2006 ) . Different species of closely related predators may also use a variety of adaptations to deal with the defences of prey . For example , some spiders are able to catch ants even with a thick cuticle while others are not ( Pek\u00e1r and Toft , 2015 ) . A true index of unpalatability requires an estimation of the total effectiveness of a combination of defensive structures , such as spines and thick cuticle and the toxicity of chemical compounds for each predator-prey combination . Estimates including spines and cuticle thickness may be relatively straight forward but information on the toxicity of chemical compounds is largely not available ( see http://toxnet . nlm . nih . gov ) . Although our approach is simplistic , the positive relationship between the index of unpalatability and the response of skinks strongly suggests that the measure is a good proxy for unpalatability . Some of the defensive traits were strongly correlated with body size . Body size alone is an anatomical constraint that may prevent predation , thus it is difficult to separate the effect of pure body size from the\u00a0relative size of some defensive traits ( e . g . , spines ) . A strong correlation between body size and the size of defensive traits is natural , because larger spines , for example , require a larger body to support them . It is , however , the\u00a0absolute size of defences not their relative size that is ecologically important ( e . g . , a skink will swallow larger spines with greater difficulty than smaller ones ) . Whatever their single effect is , all these traits together , add to an overall unpalatability of mimics . Our study describes a new complex with a golden/black colour combination . This combination is somewhat similar to the classic aposematic yellow/black phenotype ( Ruxton et al . , 2004; Williams , 2007 ) . Accordingly , our findings support the idea the coverage of golden colour acts as an honest signal of aposematism . All the predators in staged trials exhibited an aversion to the prey with the greatest coverage of golden colour . Furthermore , golden individuals were rarely found in the diet of natural populations of predators . Honest signalling is further supported by the positive correlation between the extent of the golden colour and unpalatability , controlling for body size in the analyses via phylogenetic correlation or as a covariate . The theory of honest signalling , however , predicts such a relationship within rather than across species . However , recent evidence shows that this relationship can also exist across closely related aposematic species ( Cortesi and Cheney , 2010; Mar\u00eda Arenas et al . , 2015 ) . It remains to be tested what speciation process and selection forces have driven this pattern . Given the fact , that the complex is composed of many unrelated taxonomic groups that occur in different micro-habitats , the processes are likely to vary . It is necessary to investigate whether such a relationship between species\u00a0holds for other known mimetic complexes . Unlike the classic yellow/black combination , members of the golden complex are defined by a metallic golden sheen . This sheen reflects brightly under direct sunlight making the animals very conspicuous , at least to a human observer . Just how important this sheen is in deterring a predator over and above just a matt colour has yet to be determined for this system . In other systems though , reflective iridescence has a significant additive effect ( e . g . Fabricant et al . , 2014 ) so it is likely that the sheen enhances the detectability of the signal . A possible additional benefit , or even an alternative explanation , is that the sheen is important for reflecting harmful radiation and dissipating heat ( Shi et al . , 2015 ) . Irrespective of the explanation the importance of this colour variant , further experimental investigation is warranted . The aversion to prey with golden colour was apparent irrespective of the predator\u2019s visual sensitivity . Visually- and non-visually orienting predators equally avoided the golden prey suggesting that golden mimics advertise their unpalatability via multiple sensory modalities . The non-visual predator still proportionally avoided the mimics despite not being able to detect the visual signal . This is an area of promising future investigation . Some non-visual predators potentially recognize mimics via the patterns of vibrations generated by their movements ( Pek\u00e1r et al . , 2011 ) . Predators typically use multisensory modalities to identify prey ( Bro-J\u00f8rgensen , 2010 ) such as movement , shape and defensive chemicals they emit . Our measure of unpalatability suggested that the highest proportion of individuals was moderately defended and defensiveness is distributed from highly defended to weakly defended . This is in agreement with previous claims that mimicry rings are dominated by moderately defended species ( Sherratt , 2008 ) . With a predominance of moderately defended prey , there is an expectation that their presence will erode the effectiveness of the model . Our findings , based on a limited number of mimics , multiple predatory guilds when taking into account , did not support this notion . Instead , all mimics investigated in our predator-prey trials experienced significantly lower mortality than the non-mimetic species , and this was irrespective of the coverage of gold . We found the skinks were more likely to attack the lesser-defended individuals but when the suite of predators was taken into account there was little variation in the overall predation pressure . This is potentially because some predators may not use the visual signal as a reference and are cuing in on other signals . Diet analyses of several potential predators also showed predators of all guilds , including non-visually oriented predators , captured mimics with very low frequency . The predators that we used are known to feed on non-mimetic prey too ( Jackson and Harding , 1982; Daniels , 1987; Platnick , 2000; Higgins et al . , 2001; McGinley et al . , 2015 ) . Indeed , they fed on prey related to the mimics as evidenced by the positive results of designed primers targeting the mimics . We did not measure the availability of alternative prey so we do not have an absolute indication of relative encounter rates . However , birds learn to avoid both M\u00fcllerian models and mimics irrespective of the availability of alternative prey ( Lindstr\u00f6m et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , there are multiple species of ant and ant models distributed across the sampling habitat occupying both terrestrial and arboreal habitats . The majority of the species in the complex are also ants and ants are typically super abundant due to their sociality . So it seems likely the predators would see these animals on a regular basis . Using a multi-disciplinary approach here , we faced several constraints . For example , measurements of mimic colour were based on photographs as we were unable to collect all mimics . To correct for inherent differences in illumination used during photographing mimics , the obtained RGB values were standardized but not linearised , and thus should be interpreted with caution . Similarly , the results of experiments with skinks must be interpreted with caution due to constrained randomisation used ( M\u00fcllerian mimics first ) . The response of skinks could be affected by the constrained prey order ( due to some kind of habituation ) . Yet , other predators used showed similar response to mimics as skinks , though the order of offered prey was fully randomised . Here we present the first account of the golden mimetic complex , which we believe is an exciting model for future research . Our work to date is mainly descriptive , and it requires more explicit experimental approaches to generate robust conclusions about the evolution of this golden aposematic signal . For example , the relationship between the level of unpalatability and the quality of the golden signals needs rigorous testing with a greater number of mimics . This would also help in deciphering the role of less-defended mimics in the protection of the entire complex . Similarly , exploring the function of non-visual signals in deterring predators will elucidate how this mimicry ring works . In conclusion , we present the first account of the golden mimicry complex . It consists of species that show considerable variation in their level and mode of defence , ranging from undefended Batesian mimics to highly defended M\u00fcllerian mimics , with most members of the complex somewhere in between . Our data suggest that all members of the golden mimicry complex receive quite similar net protection from a variety of predators presumably because they have a variety of defensive traits . We predict that mimetic complexes that incorporate a range of different forms of defence are not only more common than previously believed , but also more likely result in mutualism among the unequally defended members of the complex . \n Arthropod species forming the complex were selected based on the presence of a golden colour pattern on the dorsal side of their body and body size falling within the range 3\u201315 mm . All Australian ants , and known ant-like mimics , were examined for a dorsal golden appearance . The specimens we examined were either field collected by the authors ( Sydney , Blue Mountains , NSW outback , NSW eastern coast , Queensland eastern coast ) or from museum collections ( Australian Museum , Sydney ) . All other specimens we viewed were images from AntWiki ( www . antwiki . org ) , Atlas of Living Australia ( www . ala . org . au ) , or taxonomic papers ( Ogata and Taylor , 1991; Shattuck and Barnett , 2006; McArthur , 2007; Kohout , 2010a , 2010b , 2012 , 2013a , 2013b; Heterick and Shattuck , 2011; Casis and Symonds , 2012; Shattuck and Marsden , 2013 ) . The dorsal colour pattern was estimated from digital images of specimens ( Figure 7 ) as performed in other studies on mimetic complexes ( Wilson et al . , 2012 , 2015; Rodriguez et al . , 2014 ) . Field collected specimens ( of 41 species ) were killed by ethylacetate and arranged in their natural body position . Photographs were taken with a Canon Legria HF G10 against a white background and lit from above by two full spectrum light bulbs ( Repti Glo 2 . 0 UVB , Eko Terra ) . Photographs of the\u00a0remaining species ( 59 species ) were obtained mostly from the personal collection of R . Kohout , followed by AntWiki , and Atlas of Living Australia . Prior to taking measurements all photographs were calibrated for the white and/or black colour within ImageJ to correct for different lighting conditions . The average value of each RGB colour component was estimated on the following body parts: dorsal side of head , appendages ( femur II ) , pronotum , mesonotum , metanotum , petiole , first segment of the gaster , and the remaining segments of the gaster/abdomen in ants and wasps using ImageJ . Likewise , for hemipterans and spiders the average colour value of each RGB colour component of corresponding body parts ( to that of ants ) were examined including the pedipalps/chelicera , frontal third of prosoma , second third and last third of the prosoma , legs ( femur III ) , the\u00a0first half of the\u00a0abdomen and the second half of the abdomen . In each species , we also measured the length of each body part ( listed above ) and an absolute area of the golden colouration on the dorsal side using ImageJ . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 013Figure 7 . Selected list of 100 species representing the ten putative mimetic rings . Species are arranged within each ring from the most to the least unpalatable ( left to right ) . Some pictures of ants are displayed with the permission of AntWiki and R . Kohout . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 013 To assess colour pattern similarity among mimics and to find how many rings there are , we subjected 24 measures of the colour pattern , body size and area of golden patch of 100 mimics ( Pek\u00e1r et al . , 2016 ) to the Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling based on Bray-Curtis distance matrix . Because various body parts have different area and are thus differently conspicuous to predators , we used weighting of the measures by their relative size . Then we estimated the number of putative rings via k-means clustering using the vegan R package ( Oksanen et al . , 2013 ) . This method used the simple structure index ( ssi ) as a partition criterion ( Legendre and Legendre , 1998 ) as AIC is not available . Red Green Blue ( RBG ) contrast was estimated using 55 species of mimics . It was computed as the sum of differences in red , green , and blue values representing the golden and black colouration found on the body of mimics . The phylogenetic relationship at the genus level among the golden mimics was reconstructed from a combination of published phylogenies ( Moreau et al . , 2006; Regier et al . , 2010; Robson et al . , 2015; Pek\u00e1r et al . , 2017 ) . If species level phylogeny was not available , we used polytomic splitting at the species level . To test for phylogenetic inertia of classification to putative rings we used generalised least squares ( GLS ) with Pagel\u2019s phylogenetic correlation structure ( Paradis , 2006 ) , in which low value of \u03bb indicates low phylogenetic signal . The mode by which the animals generated the golden colour ( pigments or structural colours ) was determined via microscopy . One specimen of each species from each genus ( Ephutomorpha aurata , Camponotus aeneopilosus , Daerlac nigricans , Dolichoderus doriae , Polyrhachis ammon , P . vermiculosa , Ligonipes illustris , Myrmarachne luctuosa , Myrmecia tepperi , Eurymela rubrolimbata ) was further examined via SEM . The golden gaster/abdomen was dried at a room temperature for 10 days , then mounted on a stub and coated with gold prior to viewing under a SEM Jeol JSM 648OLA . The presence of pigments on the gaster/abdomen was examined in ethanol-preserved specimens under Olympus stereomicroscope SZX9 and photographed with a digital camera mounted on the stereomicroscope . The distribution of mimics across Australia was estimated using occurrence records from collections made by the authors , taxonomic papers ( Ogata and Taylor , 1991; Shattuck and Barnett , 2006; McArthur , 2007; Kohout , 2010a , 2010b , 2012 , 2013a , 2013b; Heterick and Shattuck , 2011; Casis and Symonds , 2012; Shattuck and Marsden , 2013 ) , museum material deposited in the Australian Museum and Queensland Museum and records stored in the database of the Atlas of Living Australia . To test for an association between colour similarity and distribution overlap of species in each mimicry-ring in Australia we used a grid cell of 400 \u00d7 400 km . Within each grid occurrence of a species was classified as 1 ( if present ) or 0 ( if not recorded ) ( Pek\u00e1r et al . , 2016 ) . Then a distance matrix was created from the data using the Bray-Curtis method ( Legendre and Legendre , 1998 ) . Using the colour pattern data , we created a matrix and generated a distance matrix between species using Euclidean distance . To test a hypothesis that putative rings overlap in their geographic distribution , we studied the\u00a0association between the geographical occurrence of mimics and colour similarity matrices by means of a Mantel test based on the\u00a0Pearson correlation coefficient . We estimated unpalatability in 100 mimics ( workers and adults ) from the complex using the following seven traits ( xi ) : length of the sting , number of spines , total length of spines , size of mandibles , cuticle thickness , size of poison/pygidial gland , and performance of a communal attack ( Pek\u00e1r et al . , 2016 ) . Size , number of spines and size of mandibles were measured in one individual from each species . Cuticle thickness and size of the poison/pygidial gland could only be measured from freshly collected specimens . So we collected the mimics ( workers in the case of ants ) from a variety of places across Australia ( Cairns , Townsville , Brisbane , Sydney , Blue Mountains , Broken Hill , Hay , Macquarie Port , Tweed Heads , Sunshine Coast , Hervey Bay , Agnes Water ) . In total , 75 specimens belonging to 41 species , eight genera , and four subfamilies were collected alive . Individuals were killed by freezing at \u221220\u00b0C . Cuticle thickness was measured by slicing the thorax ( mesosoma ) perpendicularly using a blade and then measuring it under a stereomicroscope to the nearest 0 . 01 mm . To measure the size of the\u00a0gland , the gland was dissected from the gaster ( thorax in bugs ) using fine forceps , placed on a glass slide in a drop of water , and covered with a coverslip . The gland was approximately oval; thus the two perpendicular lengths of the gland were measured using an ocular ruler . We estimated gland area assuming a regular ellipsoid shape . We measured the\u00a0sting length after pulling it from the abdomen using forceps . In each of these individuals we also measured the gaster/abdomen length , and thorax length . The ability to perform a communal attack ( i . e . attack by several individuals ) was taken from the literature and was assumed to be consistent throughout each genus . To estimate these traits for the remaining ant species that we failed to collect we used an interpolation based on proxy measures using 55 specimens: the size of both the poison/pygidial gland and sting length were regressed ( using a linear model ) from the size of the gaster , and cuticle thickness was regressed from the size of the thorax . These regression models ( Figure 8 ) were then used to predict values for species we were unable to sample . The gland content varies among species of ants from different subfamilies: Formicinae ants possess formic acid ( O'Rourke , 1950; Stumper , 1952 ) , Dolichoderinae ants possess terpens , such as iridodial and dolichodial ( Cavill , 1960; Cavill and Hinterberger , 1960 ) , and Myrmeciinae ants possess indole ( Jackson et al . , 1990 ) . The metathoracic scent gland in true bugs produces pungent pyrazines and alkenals ( Millar , 2005 ) . As the relative potency of these chemicals is unknown , we considered all these chemicals to be similarly noxious . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 014Figure 8 . Relationship between cuticle thickness and thorax length . ( A ) poison/pygidial gland area and gaster length ( B ) sting length and gaster length ( C ) with estimated linear regression models . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 014 Various defensive traits measured here are not similarly effective against predators . Yet we assumed that their effect is similar because different predators adapted to deal with different defences of prey . We further assumed that the effect of these traits on predators is additive . So to quantify unpalatability ( uj ) of the jth mimic we summed the ith trait values , which were scaled by their maximal value due to difference in range: uj=\u2211j=1nxijmax ( xi ) . We also computed a simple sum of defensive traits and found that the two measures are highly correlated ( Pearson correlation , r\u00a0=\u00a00 . 72 , p<0 . 0001 ) . As the index of unpalatability includes more details we used it in all analyses . In order to test that the complex is dominated by moderately-defended species we used a Shapiro-Wilk test to test for a shape of a\u00a0normal distribution of the unpalatability . To test whether the\u00a0rings are composed of a similar range of unpalatable species , we used Bartlett test of variance homogeneity . To test a hypothesis that unpalatability is related to the extent of gold colouration we used GLS to model the relationship between index of unpalatability and the absolute golden area ( which is more ecologically relevant than relative area ) . The linear predictor included a quadratic term as the response was an area . A GLS model with Brownian motion model correlation structure was used to correct for the effect of phylogeny ( Pek\u00e1r and Brabec , 2012 ) . To account for the fact that for some species , some defensive traits could not be measured ( and were interpolated ) we used weights that corresponded to the proportion of observed characteristics . Both variables were affected strongly by the body size so this measure needed to be included in the analysis . The body size had strong phylogenetic inertia ( GLS , Pagel\u2019s \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a01 . 08 ) , thus by controlling for phylogeny the body size effect was included too , therefore use of the body size as a covariate was not necessary . We investigated the diet of several predators on the campus of Macquarie University , North Ryde , Sydney , Australia . The campus in addition to buildings , contains a patch of native forest , several rocky streams , and open green space interspersed with trees where the predators could have been collected and observed which would be very difficult or even impossible in the pristine forest where the selection have taken place . The predators included noisy miners , lizards ( skinks ) , and a number of arthropods that occur on the trunks and the immediate vicinity of Eucalyptus trees , where the mimics occur ( see Table 2 ) . We sampled arthropods from under the bark of more than 50 trees and selected those that were predatory . Arthropods were immediately placed into 99% pure ethanol and then in a freezer at \u221220\u00b0C . Co-existing predators were selected among the most abundant species to represent three guilds according to their trophic strategy and prey detection modality: ( 1 ) visually-oriented euryphagous predators , ( 2 ) non-visually oriented ant-adverse predators , and ( 3 ) specialized ant-eating predators . We used the information of their gut content and data from the literature ( Jackson and Harding , 1982; Platnick , 2000; Higgins et al . , 2001; McGinley et al . , 2015 ) to identify those that feed on prey related to the mimics . If more than 10% of individuals of a specific predator species were positive for primers designed for ants , the species was classified as ant-eating . Otherwise , the species was classified as euryphagous . We collected 48 faecal samples from Eulamprus quoyii ( Dum\u00e9ril et Bibron ) ( Eastern Water Skink , Scincidae , Squamata ) and 48 samples from Manorina melanocephala Latham ( Noisy Miner , Meliphagidae , Passeriformes ) from across the Macquarie University campus during 2014 and 2015 . These two predators were selected because they feed on arthropods , were most abundant among congeners and foraged on tree trunks . Eulamprus quoyii were collected from both rocky streams ( human-altered ) and forest-edge by noosing . Lizards typically defecated immediately upon capture and in some cases we gently massaged the abdomen to expel a faecal pellet . Manorina melanocephala faeces were collected at temporary feeding stations to avoid handling the birds . We lured birds to a large canvas ( 3 \u00d7 5 m ) by placing small amounts of sweet cake near a water bowl and perches made from branches . The stations were monitored continuously . We sampled across a wide area in order to target specific family groups and the sampling was short enough to ensure that only droppings produced from previous meals were collected . We stored both the lizard and bird faecal samples individually in Eppendorf tubes in 80% ethanol in a \u221220\u00b0C freezer . This work was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Macquarie University ( ARA 2014/031 ) . The gut of predators progressively degrades DNA through digestion ( Sint et al . , 2011 ) . To account for the shortened DNA fragments we designed specific primers , which amplified fragments no longer than 300 bp ( Deagle et al . , 2006 ) . This length is known to be a good compromise that increases the likelihood of amplification while still being long and variable enough to distinguish different prey taxa ( Herbert et al . , 2003; Zeale et al . , 2011 ) . A\u00a0fragment of the COI gene was PCR amplified using LCO1490 ( 5\u00b4-GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG-3\u00b4 ) and HCO2198 ( 5\u00b4-TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA-3\u00b4 ) primers ( Folmer et al . , 1994 ) from representatives of potential prey found across the Macquarie University campus ( Hemiptera: Daerlac apicalis , D . cephalotes , D . nigricans; Formicidae: Myrmecia piliventris , M . tepperi , Camponotus aeneopilosus , Polyrhachis ammon , P . aurea , P . ornata , P . vermiculosa; Araneae: Myrmarachne luctuosa , M . erythrocephala ) and predators ( Araneae: Clubiona robusta L . Koch , Clubiona sp . ; Euryopis umbilicata L . Koch , Euryopis sp . ; Hemicloea sp . 1 , Hemicloea sp . 2; Holoplatys planissima ( L . Koch ) ; Lampona murina L . Koch; Ocrisiona sp . ; Sandalodes superbus ( Karsch ) ; Servaea incana ( Karsch ) ) . Each PCR ( 20 \u03bcL total volume ) consisted of 5 \u03bcL of DNA , 1 \u03bcL of each primer ( 10 \u03bcM ) , 0 . 4 \u03bcL of 10 mM dNTP\u00b4s , 2 . 2 \u03bcL of 25 mM MgCl2 , 2 \u03bcL of 10x PCR buffer , 1 \u03bcL of bovine albumin serum ( BSA ) , 0 . 3 \u03bcL of Taq Polymerase ( 5 u/\u03bcL ) , and 7 . 1 \u03bcL of DNA-free water . PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 3 . 5 min; 38 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min , 44\u00b0C for 1 min ( annealing temperature ) , 72\u00b0C for 1 . 5 min; a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min . PCR products were detected by electrophoresis in 2% GoldView-stained agarose gels . Amplified products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit ( Quiagen ) and sequenced in both directions with BigDye Terminator v3 . 1 Sequence Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . Sequencing was carried out on an ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems ) . Sequences were assembled in Sequencher 4 . 8 ( Gene Codes Corporation , Ann Arbor , MI ) and aligned using ClustalW ( Thompson et al . , 1994 ) implemented in MEGA 5 . 1 ( Tamura et al . , 2011 ) . Based on sequence similarities/differences , group-specific primers , which would amplify DNA of mimics in the predator guts , were designed using Amplicon . b08 ( Jarman , 2004 ) . Four primer pairs were tested with all prey and predator specimens used in this study to ensure that the primers amplify DNA of the studied prey groups only: primers MyrmF and MyrmR amplified Myrmarachne spiders , DaerF and DaerR amplified Daerlac true bugs , FormF and FormR amplified Camponotus , Polyrhachis and Myrmecia ants , and BothmF and BothmR primers amplified Bothriomutilla mutillid wasps ( for primer sequences see Table 4 ) and to reject cross-amplifications with the predators . The sequences of cytochrome c oxidase obtained from the studied predators and the mimics are deposited in GenBank ( Accession numbers KX980351--KX980391 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22089 . 015Table 4 .

DNA from fecal samples ( 50 samples of skinks and 48 samples of noisy miner ) was extracted using the\u00a0DNeasy mericon Food Kit ( Qiagen ) following manufacturer\u2019s Small Fragment protocol . PCRs were performed using Multiplex PCR kit ( Qiagen ) under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 min; 42 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s , annealing temperature for 90 s ( 47 . 5\u00b0C when using Bothm primers , 43 and 45\u00b0C with the other primers ) , 72\u00b0C for 90 s; and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min . The reaction mixture total volume of 20 \u03bcL consisted of 10 . 6 \u03bcL of Multiplex PCR Master Mix , 1 . 8 \u03bcL of Q-Solution , 2 . 1 \u03bcL of RNase-free water , 0 . 5 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcM forward and 0 . 5 \u03bcL of reverse primers , and 4 . 5 \u03bcL of DNA . PCR with Bothm primers was done separately whereas three remaining primer pairs were used in one multiplex reaction . PCR products were detected by electrophoresis in 2% GoodView-stained agarose gels . PCR was repeated for each sample and primer combination at least three times to exclude falsely negative results . In positive samples , PCR was repeated once again using primers modified with MID identifiers ( i . e . multiplex identifiers , 10bp-long barcoding sequences ) . Each sample was thus marked with a unique combination of barcodes . PCR products were purified using a\u00a0QIAquick PCR Purification Kit ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols . The\u00a0concentration of each PCR product was measured using NanoDrop 8000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer ( Thermo Scientific , Waltman , MA ) and assessed comparing to 50 bp ladder ( Fermentas ) . Five \u03bcL of 50 \u03bcg/\u03bcL PCR products was pooled into the same sterile vial and sent for sequencing . Sequencing library was prepared using Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit and Ion PI Template OT2 200 Kit v3 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Sequencing on the Ion Proton System was provided by the\u00a0SEQme company ( Dob\u0159\u00ed\u0161 , Czech Republic ) . Sequencing data were processed using the Galaxy platform ( https://usegalaxy . org/ ) , BioEdit 7 . 2 . 5 ( Hall , 1999 ) and MEGA 5 . 10 . Reads were split according to their MIDs resulting in files corresponding to individual predators . Then , forward and reverse primers were removed and sequences were filtered according to their length ( <120 or 180 bp ) to remove dimers or too short reads . The sequences were collapsed and rare haplotypes ( containing\u00a0<2 identical sequences ) were removed . Furthermore , sequences with stop codons and indels causing frameshifts were also removed . Remaining haplotypes were clustered into molecular operational taxonomic units ( MOTU ) using jMOTU 4 . 1 ( Jones et al . , 2011 ) with a 4 bp cut-off ( corresponding to 3% sequence divergence ) . Each MOTU was compared to the GenBank database using megablast and BOLD database and to the sequences of mimics obtained within this study . NGS produced 11 068 904 informative reads from all predators of which 614 , 273 reads belonged to the mimics . Availability of mimics to the predators was estimated by visual search on the trunks and below bark of 20 gum trees randomly selected on the campus . On each tree , abundance of mimics was surveyed by one person up to the height of 2 m from the ground for a period of 30 min on a sunny day . All mimics were collected , brought to the laboratory and identified to species . To test a hypothesis that the\u00a0frequencies of captured mimics by all predators and those available at the microhabitat of predators are similar we used Chi-square test . In order to estimate the attack rate exerted by the whole community of predators as precisely as possible , we had to take into account two important variables that affect the predation: ( 1 ) the relative frequency ( fij ) of positively screened ith predator individual for each jth mimic; ( 2 ) the capture probability of araneophagous spider predator ( Lampona ) , where body size is a strong predictor of the likelihood of predation . The capture probability was estimated for each spider predator and mimic ( Pek\u00e1r et al . , 2016 ) . This latter adjustment was necessary in order to take into account the fact that spiders could have captured juvenile Myrmarachne or Daerlac individuals , which are not golden mimics and could not be distinguished from adult specimens by molecular methods . The functional model for the capture probability was obtained from data on eight spider species representing different guilds ( Nentwig and Wissel , 1986 ) . The logistic function was 11+exp ( \u22121 . 99+2 . 11ratioij ) , where ratioij is the mimic/predator body size ratio . The ratio was estimated by measuring the body size of ten collected specimens of each predator and mimic . Then the overall pressure by the community of predators was estimated as a sum of all attack rates by means of the killing value , Kj ( Varley and Gradwell , 1960 ) :\u00a0Kj=\u2211j=1n\u2212log ( 1\u2212fij ) . To test whether natural mortality caused by predation is related to unpalatability of mimics we used nonparametric regression as the response variable had non-standard distribution , namely generalized additive model ( GAM ) from the mgcv package ( Wood , 2011 ) . We regressed log-transformed K-values ( in order to stay within positive bounds ) against unpalatability index . For predation trials we selected five species of mimics found on the Macquarie University campus . The five species represented a gradient of unpalatability ( Table 3 ) within the mimetic complex . We included examples of the most unpalatable to the least palatable mimics: the ants Polyrhachis ammon , Polyrhachis vermiculosa , and Camponotus aeneopilosus , the true bug Daerlac nigricans , and the spider Myrmarachne luctuosa . Based on their unpalatability , the ants and bugs were predicted to be M\u00fcllerian mimics , while the spider was predicted to be a Batesian mimic . Unpalatability was re-estimated for these five species using ten individuals from each species . All attributes as measured previously were re-measured with the addition of a behavioural measure . The behavioural measure was the frequency of biting in the field following agitation with forceps . The addition of an extra measure adjusted the previous estimated unpalatability ( uj ) but the relative relationship of unpalatability between species remained the same . We used Eulamprus quoyii as our visually-oriented euryphagous vertebrate predator . At least 14 days prior to the experiment adult skinks were placed singly in a white container ( 70 \u00d7 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a040 cm ) at constant temperature 26\u00b0C and L:D\u00a0=\u00a012:12 regime . They were fed regularly with three crickets ( Acheta domestica ) three times a week . The skinks were then starved five days prior to the predation trials . One day prior to the trial a layer of butter was applied to the sides of the white container to prevent arthropods from climbing the walls and escaping . At the start of a trial a lizard was left to settle down for a period of 5 min . A prey item was released into the container and the behaviour of the skink during the 5 min trial was recorded with a fixed video camera positioned above the container . Five minutes was deemed sufficient , as previous feeding trials with crickets have shown this species of lizard will attempt to capture prey within 1 min . If the potential prey survived it was removed , and the skink was left for 2 min to settle down . Another prey item was then released and so on until all five mimic prey types were used . As a non-mimic control , we used juveniles of the spider , Badumna insignis L . Koch , which was of a similar size to the other species but was not a mimic as it lacked golden colouration . At the end a cricket was released as a positive control . Results of trials were used in the analysis only if the cricket was captured . The prey was offered to skinks using a constrained randomisation . There was randomisation within M\u00fcllerian mimics ( ants ) followed by randomisation within less defended mimics ( Daerlac , Myrmarachne ) and non-mimic prey ( Badumna ) because the predator must learn unpalatability by encountering the unpalatable models first . The learned aversion was necessary because skinks were collected in the wild a number of months prior to the trials and fed with crickets since then . We used 26 skinks in total . Ants , spiders and bugs were collected a few days prior to the trial . From the video footage we recorded whether prey was consumed or spat out . The spider Lampona murina L . Koch was used as a nonvisually-oriented ant-adverse predator that will not capture ants but other spiders . Twenty-five late-instar juvenile Lampona spiders were collected from the bark of gum ( Eucalyptus sp . ) trees on the Macquarie University campus and kept individually in tubes ( 1 cm diameter , 10 cm long ) . Spiders were placed in a chamber set to 23\u00b0C and L:D\u00a0=\u00a016:8 regime . Spiders were fed with a clubionid spider once a week and provided with a moistened piece of gauze . Lampona was not fed seven days prior to a trial . During a trial , an individual from the five mimetic prey species and one non-mimic spider ( Clubiona sp . ) was released into the Petri dish in a random order ( diameter 6 cm ) . The prey was offered to Lampona in a random order . Induction of learned aversion was not necessary because the\u00a0spiders were collected from the field only a week prior to the experiment . If the prey was not captured within 30 min we replaced it with a new one until one prey was captured . If the prey was captured , another prey was offered seven days later . In each trial we recorded capture frequency of Lampona . Finally , we used the spider Servaea incana ( Keyserling ) as a specialised ant-eating predator . Twenty-seven adult individuals of Servaea spiders were collected from gum trees on the Macquarie University campus and placed singly in a Petri dish ( 8 cm diameter ) and kept at 23\u00b0C and L:D\u00a0=\u00a016:8 . Spiders were fed with small crickets once a week and provided with a moistened piece of gauze . We did not feed Servaea for five days prior to a trial . One individual of a mimic prey species was released into the dish . The prey was offered to Servaea in a random order . Induction of learned aversion was not necessary because spiders were collected from the field only a week prior to the experiment . If the prey was not captured within 5 min we replaced it with a new one . If the prey was captured another prey was offered five days later . In each trial we recorded whether the prey was captured as well as the behaviour of Servaea and prey . To compare the frequency of capture among used prey types for each predator , relative frequencies of prey capture from Eulamprus quoyi or Servaea experiments were subjected to generalised estimating equations ( GEE ) from the geepack package with a binomial error structure due to repeated use of the same skink individuals with different prey . The\u00a0exchangeable association structure was used ( Varley and Gradwell , 1960 ) . To test whether the post-attack reaction of the skinks was related to prey unpalatability we used generalized linear model with binomial error structure ( GLM ) of scores of the post-attack reaction of the skinks and the unpalatability index . The post-attack reaction was ranked as follows: 0 if the mimic was eaten , one if it was eaten but the skink cleaned its mouth , and two if the skink spat out the mimic . The ranks were then scaled to 0\u20131 range . To compare the relative capture frequencies of Lampona on the prey species a Cochran Q test was used . To test whether overall mortality of prey is related to its unpalatability we used a\u00a0general linear model ( LM ) of the sum of all probabilities of capture ( pij ) by the three predators and unpalatability index . The sum of capture rate was expressed as a killing value , Kj using the formula: Kj=\u2211j=1n\u2212log ( 1\u2212pij ) . All statistical analyses were performed in R ( R Core Team , 2013 ) . For each model , diagnostic plots were used to assess model adequacy , such as variance homogeneity and distribution of residuals ."}

Instead , our memories tend to be dynamic: we remember how a sequence of events unfolded , and when we do this , we often re-experience at least part of that same sequence . If the memory includes physical movement , the sequence combines space and time to remember a trajectory . For example , a mouse might remember how it went down a hole and found cheese there . However , mathematical models of how past experiences are stored in our brains and retrieved when we remember them have so far focused on snapshot memories . \u2018Attractor network models\u2019 are one type of mathematical model that neuroscientists use to represent how neurons communicate with each other to store memories . These models can provide insights into how circuits of neurons , for example those in the hippocampus ( a part of the brain crucial for memory ) , may have evolved to remember the past , but so far they have only focused on how single moments , rather than sequences of events , are represented by populations of neurons . Spalla et al . found a way to extend these models , so they could analyse how networks of neurons can store and retrieve dynamic memories . These memories are represented in the brain as \u2018continuous attractors\u2019 , which can be thought of as arrows that attract mental trajectories first to the arrow itself , and once on the arrow , to the arrowhead . Each recalled event elicits the next one on the arrow , as the mental trajectory advances towards the arrowhead . Spalla et al . determined that memory networks in the hippocampus of mammals can store large numbers of these \u2018arrows\u2019 , up to the same amount of \u2018snapshot\u2019 memories predicted to be stored with similar models . Spalla et al . \u2019s results may allow researchers to better understand memory storage and recall , since they allow for the modelling of complex and realistic aspects of episodic memories . This could provide insights into processes such as why our minds wander , as well as having implications for the study of how neurons physically interact with each other to transmit information .", "source": "Episodic memory has a dynamic nature: when we recall past episodes , we retrieve not only their content , but also their temporal structure . The phenomenon of replay , in the hippocampus of mammals , offers a remarkable example of this temporal dynamics . However , most quantitative models of memory treat memories as static configurations , neglecting the temporal unfolding of the retrieval process . Here , we introduce a continuous attractor network model with a memory-dependent asymmetric component in the synaptic connectivity , which spontaneously breaks the equilibrium of the memory configurations and produces dynamic retrieval . The detailed analysis of the model with analytical calculations and numerical simulations shows that it can robustly retrieve multiple dynamical memories , and that this feature is largely independent of the details of its implementation . By calculating the storage capacity , we show that the dynamic component does not impair memory capacity , and can even enhance it in certain regimes . \n The spontaneous dynamics produced by the network is constrained to the low dimensional manifold codified in the connectivity matrix and spanned by the parameter x\u2192 . The short-range interactions and the uniform inhibition enforced by the firing threshold h0 produce a localized 'bump' of activity in the manifold . The presence of an asymmetry in the connection strengths prevents the system from remaining in a stationary equilibrium . Instead , it generates a steady flow of activity in the direction of the asymmetry . This flow is illustrated in Figure 2 ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , obtained with numerical simulation of a network encoding a one- , two- , or three-dimensional manifold , respectively . In the simulation , each neuron is assigned to a preferential firing location xi\u2192 in the manifold to encode , and the plots show the activity of the network organized according to this disposition . The activity of the population clusters in a bump around a certain position at each time point ( t1 , t2 , and t3 ) , and the bump shifts by effect of the asymmetric component of the interactions . In this way , the neural population collectively encodes an evolving coordinate on the manifold spanned by x\u2192 . The coherence of the representation is not affected by the presence of the asymmetric term: the movement of the activity bump happens without dissipation . The speed of movement of the bump is modulated by the value of the parameter \u03b3 and by the sparsity level of the representation f , that\u00a0is the fraction of neurons active at each given time during the dynamics . The dependence of the speed on these two parameters is illustrated in 2 ( d ) . Stronger asymmetry ( high \u03b3 ) produces a faster shift . Interestingly , the sparsity value f acts as a modulator of the influence of \u03b3: sparser representations move more slowly than dense ones . While \u03b3 describes a feature of the synaptic interactions , determined during the learning phase and relatively fixed at the short timescales of retrieval , f can be instantaneously modulated during retrieval dynamics . A change in the gain or the excitability of the population can be used to produce dynamic retrieval at different speeds . Thus , the model predicts an interaction between the sparsity and the speed of the reactivation of a continuous memory sequence , with increased activity leading to faster replay . It is worth noting , however , that the direction of the dynamics is fixed with J: the model is able to retrieve either forward or backward sequences , but not alternate between them . The dependence of the retrieval speed s on \u03b3 and f is well described by the approximate functional form ( 6 ) s\u2062 ( \u03b3 , f ) =A\u2062\u03b3\u2062fb\u2062\u03b3+c\u2062f+d\u2062\u03b3\u2062f+e\u2062\u03b3\u2062f2 This dependence is shown in 2 ( b ) , where the dots are the values obtained with numerical simulations and the full curves the fitted relationship . The full understanding of the nature of this functional form remains an open challenge for future analysis . As we will see in the next section , the analytical solution of the model yields the same form to describe the dependence of speed on \u03b3 and f , but a closed-form solution is still lacking . In the model presented , the asymmetry in the interactions is enforced uniformly along a single direction also for two- and three-dimensional manifolds , representing the case in which neural dynamics follows a forced trajectory along one dimension , but is free to move without energy costs along the others . However , the same mechanism can be used to produce one-dimensional trajectories embedded in low-dimensional manifolds , with the introduction of a positional dependence in the direction of the asymmetry ( Blum and Abbott , 1996 ) . In this case , an interesting problem is posed by the intersection of two trajectories embedded in the same manifold: is the network , during the retrieval of one trajectory , able to cross these intersections , or do they hinder dynamical retrieval ? The investigation of the full phenomenology of position-dependent asymmetric kernels with intersecting trajectories is beyond the scope of the present work , but we present in Figure 2 ( e ) a numerical study of a minimal version of this problem , with two orthogonal trajectories ( Figure 2 ( e ) , black arrows ) embedded in a 2D manifold and memorized simultaneously in the network . Notice that in this case the two trajectories are parallel to the main axis of the square environment , but they do not need to be: any pair of orthogonal trajectories will behave in the same manner . When the network is cued to retrieve the horizontal trajectory , the behavior at the intersection depends on the strength \u03b3 and scale \u03be of the asymmetric component . At low \u03b3 , the dynamics spontaneously switch trajectory at the intersection ( Figure 2 ( e ) , blue curve ) , while for \u03b3 sufficiently large the retrieval of the horizontal trajectory is successful ( Figure 2 ( e ) , orange curve ) . The value \u03b3* required for a successful crossing depends on the spatial scale \u03be: larger \u03be allow for crossing with lower values of \u03b3 , as shown in the top-right inset of Figure 2 ( e ) , in which \u03b3*\u2062 ( \u03be ) is plotted . Intuitively , the ability of the network to retrieve crossing trajectories depends on the shape of the activity bump , which needs to be sufficiently elongated in the direction of retrieval for the successful crossing of the intersection . The blue and orange insets of Figure 2 ( e ) show the difference in shape of the bump in the case of a trajectory switch ( blue ) and successful crossing ( orange ) . The simplicity of continuous attractor models often allows to extract important computational principles from their analytical solution ( Wu et al . , 2008; Fung et al . , 2010 ) . In our case , the dynamic behavior of the system and its features can be fully described analytically with a generalization of the framework developed by Battaglia and Treves , 1998 . For this purpose , it is easier to formulate the problem in the continuum , and describe the population activity {Vi} by its profile V\u2062 ( x\u2192 ) on the attractive manifold parametrized by the coordinate x\u2192 , and the dynamical evolution as a discrete step map , equivalent to Equation 1 . ( 7 ) V\u2062 ( x\u2192 , t+1 ) =g\u2062[h\u2062 ( x\u2192 , t ) ]+ ( 8 ) h\u2062 ( x\u2192 , t ) =\u222b\ud835\udc51x\u2192\u2032\u2062K\u2062 ( x\u2192-x\u2192\u2032 ) \u2062V\u2062 ( x\u2192\u2032 , t ) -h0 The requirement of a rigid shift of population activity is then imposed by setting the activity at time t+1 to be equal at the activity at time t , but translated by an amount \u0394\u2062x\u2192=\u03c4\u2062s\u2062n\u2192 , proportional to the speed s of the shift and in the direction n\u2192 of the asymmetry in the connections . The timescale \u03c4 sets the time unit in which the duration of the evolution is measured and does not have an impact on the behavior of the system . The activity profile V\u2062 ( x\u2192 ) is then found as the self-consistent solution to the integral equation ( 9 ) V\u2062 ( x\u2192+\u0394\u2062x\u2192 ) =g\u2062[\u222b\ud835\udc51x\u2192\u2032\u2062K\u2062 ( x\u2192-x\u2192\u2032 ) \u2062V\u2062 ( x\u2192\u2032 ) -h0]+ Equation 9 is valid in general . We will focus here , for the explicit derivation ( reported in appendix C ) , on the case of a one dimensional manifold with an exponential interaction kernel ( 10 ) K\u2062 ( x-x\u2032 ) =e-|x-x\u2032|+\u03b3\u2062sign\u2062 ( x-x\u2032 ) \u2062e-|x-x\u2032| In this case , the activity bump will take the form: ( 11 ) V\u2062 ( x ) ={C\u2062ek1\u2062x\u2062cos\u2061 ( k2\u2062x ) +g\u2062\u03b81-2\u2062gif -R\u2264x\u2264R0if -R>x\u2062 or \u2062x>R The parameters k1=k1\u2062 ( \u03b3 , s ) and k2=k2\u2062 ( \u03b3 , s ) determine the properties of the solution and they depend on the values of \u03b3 and speed s=\u0394\u2062x/\u03c4 . k2 is related to the bump width by the relation ( 12 ) R=\u03c02\u2062k2where R is the point at which V\u2062 ( x ) =0 . k1 is related to the asymmetry of the bump: in the limit case \u03b3=0 , s=0 ( Figure 3 ( a ) , first column ) k1=0 , and we recover the cosine solution of the symmetric kernel case studied in Battaglia and Treves , 1998 . Larger k1 values result in more and more asymmetric shapes ( Figure 3 ( a ) , second and third columns ) . From this analytical solution , we can determine the dependence of the speed s on the asymmetry strength \u03b3 and on the sparsity f=2\u2062R/L ( note that in the continuum case the fraction of active neurons is given by the ratio between the bump size 2\u2062R and the manifold size L ) . The sparsity f is modulated by the value of the gain g , as shown in Figure 3 ( b ) : a larger gain in the transfer function corresponds to a sparser activity . The exact relation s\u2062 ( \u03b3 , f ) can be obtained from the numerical solution of a transcendental equation ( see appendix C ) , and can be approximated with a functional shape analogous to the one used for the simulated network: ( 13 ) s\u2062 ( \u03b3 , f ) =A\u2062\u03b3\u2062fb\u2062\u03b3+c\u2062f+d\u2062\u03b3\u2062f+e\u2062\u03b3\u2062f2 The full transcendental solution and the fitted curves are reported in Figure 3 ( c ) . The analytical solution of the model shows that the network performs dynamical retrieval for all values of the asymmetry strength \u03b3 , and that this parameter influences the retrieval speed and the shape of the activity bump . To further investigate the robustness of dynamical retrieval to parameter changes , we investigate with numerical simulations the behavior of the model with respect to another important parameter: the scale \u03be of the anti-symmetric component . We run several dynamics of a network with interaction kernel given by ( 14 ) K\u2062 ( d ) =e-d+\u03b3\u2062sign\u2062 ( d ) \u2062e-d/\u03bevarying the parameters \u03b3 and \u03be and measuring the retrieval speed , the peak value of the activity bump and its skeweness . The joint effects of \u03b3 and \u03be are shown in Figure 4 . In the whole range of parameters analyzed , spanning four orders of magnitude for both parameters , the network was able to produce dynamic retrieval . \u03b3 and \u03be affect the speed of the shift , the peak values of the activity distribution and the skewness of the activity bump , without hindering network functionality . Moreover , all these feature vary gradually and mildly with the parameters values , producing dynamical behavior qualitatively similar in the full parameter range . This analysis shows that dynamical retrieval does not require any fine tuning of network parameters , but relies on the assumption of an exponential shape for the interaction kernel . How robust is the behavior of the network to the details of the kernel shape ? We addressed this question by simulating the network dynamics with alternative kernel choices . We kept fixed the symmetric component , and explored three different anti-simmetric shapes: a gaussian-derivative shape ( Figure 5a ) , a sinusoidal shape ( Figure 5b ) and a double step function ( Figure 5c ) . Each of these simulations produced the same retrieval dynamics ( a stable bump shifting at constant speed ) , the only effect of the kernel shape being on the details of the shape of the activity bump ( Figure 5 , bottom row ) . This shows that the dynamic retrieval mechanism , much like standard continuous attractors , is robust with respect to the precise shape of the interactions . Importantly , no particular relationship is required between the shape of the symmetric and the anti-symmetric components of the kernel . We described in detail the behavior of a neural network with asymmetric connectivity in the case of a single manifold encoded in the synaptic connectivity . For the network to behave as an autoassociative memory , however , it needs to be able to store and dynamically retrieve multiple manifolds . This is possible if we construct the interaction matrix Ji\u2062j as the sum of the contributions from p different , independently encoded manifolds: ( 15 ) Ji\u2062j=1N\u2062\u2211\u03bc=1pK\u2062 ( x\u2192i\u03bc-x\u2192j\u03bc ) Here , each xi\u03bc represent the preferred firing location of neuron i in the manifold \u03bc , and K is the same interaction kernel as in Equation 4 , containing a symmetric and anti-symmetric component . The resulting dynamics show multiple continuous attractors , corresponding to the stored manifolds . Given an initial configuration , the networks rapidly converges to the nearest ( i . e . most correlated ) attractor , forming a coherent bump that then moves along the manifold as a consequence of the asymmetric component of the connectivity . The same dynamics , if projected on the other unretrieved manifolds , appear as random noise . This is illustrated in Figure 6 obtained with numerical simulations of a network encoding three different manifolds ( of dimension one in ( a ) , dimension two in ( b ) ) , and dynamically retrieving the first one . How does this shifting activity bump relate to the activity of single cells ? To clarify this aspect we simulated an electrophysiological recording from the dynamical retrieval of Figure 6 ( a ) . We selected a random subset of 15 of the 1000 cells of the network , and generated spike trains using a poisson point process with an instantaneous firing rate proportional to the activity level of each cell yielded by the retrieval dynamics at each time step , plus a small noise . With this procedure we obtain the spike trains of each cell , that we can visualize with a rasterplot ( Figure 6c ) . We can sort the cells according to their firing field position on each of the three manifolds ( if these were , e . g . , linear tracks , this would correspond to sorting according to place field positions in each of the tracks ) . When ordered as in the retrieved manifold , the recorded cells show a structured pattern that is considered the hallmark of sequential activity in experimental studies ( Figure 6c , first column ) . If the same spikes are ordered according to the unretrieved manifolds , the pattern is lost ( Figure 6c , second and third column ) , indicating that the population activity is retrieving the dynamical structure of the first manifold specifically . Multiple dynamic manifolds can be memorized and retrieved by the network , with different speeds . Figure 7 ( b ) shows the result of the numerical simulation of a network with five different one-dimensional manifold stored in its connectivity matrix , each encoded with a different value of \u03b3 ( see appendix D ) . These manifold are dynamically retrieved by the network at different speeds , depending on the corresponding \u03b3 . This allows the model to simultaneously store memories without the constraint of a fixed dynamical timescale , an important feature for the description of biological circuits that need to be able to operate at different temporal scales . Different memories stored in the same neural population can interact with each other , building more retrieval schemes in which , for example , the retrieval of a memory cues the retrieval of another one . To investigate this possibility , we have incorporated in the model a mechanism for interaction between memories , in which the endpoint of a dynamical , one-dimensional manifold elicits the activation of the start point of a different one ( see Appendix E ) . This results in the sequential retrieval of multiple memories , one after the other , as illustrated in Figure 7 ( d ) . The top row shows the evolution in time of the overlaps m\u03bc: ( 16 ) m\u03bc\u2062 ( t ) =1N2\u2062\u2211i , jKS\u2062 ( xi\u03bc-xj\u03bc ) \u2062Vi\u2062 ( t ) \u2062Vj\u2062 ( t ) These order parameters quantify the coherence of the population activity V\u2062 ( t ) with each of the manifolds . Localized activity in manifold \u03bc results in a large m\u03bc , while a low m\u03bc corresponds to an incoherent scattering of the activity . The network retrieves the manifolds in sequence , one at a time , following the instructed transitions encoded in its connectivity . The all-or-nothing behavior of the coherence parameters segments the continuous dynamics of the network into a sequence of discrete states . The bottom row shows the evolution of the retrieved position , given in each manifold by the center of mass: ( 17 ) <x>\u03bc\u2062 ( t ) =1N\u2062\u2211ixi\u03bc\u2062Vi\u2062 ( t ) The dynamic runs across the retrieved manifold , from its beginning to its end , then jumps to next one and repeats the process . Note that the position in each of the un-retrieved manifold fluctuates around L/2 , as a consequence of the incoherence of the activity . Within each of the retrieved manifolds , the dynamic retains its continuous nature in the representation of the evolving position . This sequential dynamic goes beyond the simple cued retrieval of independent memories that is the focus of most autoassociative memory models , and provides an example of a hybrid computational system , encoding both continuous and discrete features . The interaction mechanism introduced here provides the opportunity to investigate the effect of more complex interactions than the simple memory chain presented here . We present here this first example as a proof of principle of the possibility of storing interacting dynamical memories , and will proceed to the investigation of more complex structures ( e . g . interaction networks , probabilistic interactions , etc . ) in future studies . The number of maps that can be stored and retrieved by an attractor network of this kind is typically proportional to the number of inputs per neuron C ( Treves and Rolls , 1991 ) . The memory load \u03b1=p/C crucially determines the behavior of the system: when \u03b1 is increased above a certain threshold value \u03b1c , the network is not able to retrieve any of the stored memories , falling instead into a disordered state . Therefore it is the magnitude of \u03b1c , that\u00a0is the storage capacity of the system , that determines how effectively it can operate as a memory . To estimate the storage capacity of dynamic continuous attractors , and to investigate how it is impacted by the presence of asymmetric connections , we proceed along two complementary paths . In the case a fully connected network , where the analytical tools developed for equilibrium systems are not applicable , we take advantage of the fact that numerical simulations can be effective for the estimation of the capacity , since the number of connections per neuron C ( the relevant parameters in the definition of the storage capacity \u03b1c=p/C ) coincides with the number of neurons , minus one . For a highly diluted system , on the other hand , the number of neurons is much larger than C , making the simulation of the system very difficult in practice . We then resort to an analytical formulation based on a signal-to-noise analysis ( Battaglia and Treves , 1998 ) , that exploits the vanishing correlations between inputs of different neurons in a highly diluted network , and does not require symmetry in the connectivity ( Derrida et al . , 1987 ) . The quantification of the effect of loops in the dense connectivity regime , developed in Shiino and Fukai , 1992 and Roudi and Treves , 2004 for the case of static , discrete attractors , is beyond the scope of the present work and remains an interesting open direction . In both the fully connected and the highly diluted case we study the dependence of the capacity on two important parameters: the map sparsity , that\u00a0is the ratio between the width of the connectivity kernel ( fixed to one without loss of generality ) and the size L of the stored manifolds , and the asymmetry strength \u03b3 . Note that the map sparsity 1/L is different from the activity sparsity f: the former is a feature of the stored memories , that we will treat as a control parameter in the following analysis; the latter is a feature of the network dynamics , and its value will be fixed by an optimization procedure in the calculation of the maximal capacity . The signal-to-noise approach we follow , illustrated in details in Battaglia and Treves , 1998 , involves writing the local field hi as the sum of two contributions: a signal term , due to the retrieved \u2013 \u2018condensed\u2019 \u2013 map , and a noise term consisting of the sum of the contributions of all the other , \u2018uncondensed\u2019 maps . In the diluted regime ( C/N\u21920 ) , these contributions are independent and can be summarized by a Gaussian term \u03c1\u2062z , where z is a random variable with zero mean and unit variance . In the continuous limit , assuming without loss of generality that map \u03bc=1 is retrieved , we can write: ( 18 ) h\u2062 ( x1 ) =g\u2062\u222bL\ud835\udc51x1\u2063\u2032\u2062K\u2062 ( x1-x1\u2063\u2032 ) \u2062V\u2062 ( x1\u2063\u2032 ) +\u03c1\u2062z The noise will have variance: ( 19 ) \u03c12=\u03b1\u2062y\u2062L2\u2062\u27e8\u27e8K2\u2062 ( x-x\u2032 ) \u27e9\u27e9where L is the size of the map , \u27e8\u27e8K2\u2062 ( x-x\u2032 ) \u27e9\u27e9 is the spatial variance of the kernel and ( 20 ) y=1N\u2062\u2211iVi2is the average square activity . We can write the fixed point equation for the average activity profile m1\u2062 ( x ) , incorporating the dynamic shift with an argument similar to the one made for the single map case: ( 21 ) m1\u2062 ( x+\u0394\u2062x ) =g\u2062\u222b+D\u2062z\u2062 ( h\u2062 ( x ) -h0 ) where D\u2062z= ( e-z2/2/2\u2062\u03c0 ) \u2062d\u2062z and \u222b+f\u2062 ( x ) \u2062\ud835\udc51x=\u222bf\u2062 ( x ) \u2062\u03b8\u2062 ( x ) \u2062\ud835\udc51x . The average square activity y , entering the noise term , reads ( 22 ) y=g2L\u2062\u222b\ud835\udc51x\u2062\u222b+D\u2062z\u2062 ( h\u2062 ( x ) -h0 ) 2 Introducing the rescaled variables ( 23 ) w=-h0\u03c1 ( 24 ) v\u2062 ( x ) =m1\u2062 ( x ) \u03c1 And the functions ( 25 ) \ud835\udca9\u2062 ( x ) =x\u2062\u03a6\u2062 ( x ) +\u03c3\u2062 ( x ) ( 26 ) \u2133\u2062 ( x ) = ( 1+x2 ) \u2062\u03a6\u2062 ( x ) +x\u2062\u03c3\u2062 ( x ) where \u03a6\u2062 ( x ) and \u03c3\u2062 ( x ) are the Gaussian cumulative and the Gaussian probability mass function respectively , we can rewrite the fixed-point equation as ( 27 ) v\u2062 ( x+\u0394\u2062x ) =g\u2062\ud835\udca9\u2062 ( \u222b\ud835\udc51x\u2032\u2062K\u2062 ( x-x\u2032 ) \u2062v\u2062 ( x\u2032 ) +w ) ( 28 ) y=\u03c12\u2062g2\u2062\u222bd\u2062xL\u2062\u2133\u2062 ( \u222b\ud835\udc51x\u2032\u2062K\u2062 ( x-x\u2032 ) \u2062v\u2062 ( x\u2032 ) +w ) Substituting Equation 28 in the expression for the noise variance 19 we obtain ( 29 ) 1\u03b1=g2\u2062L\u2062\u27e8\u27e8K2\u27e9\u27e9\u2062\u222b\ud835\udc51x\u2062\u2133\u2062 ( \u222b\ud835\udc51x\u2032\u2062K\u2062 ( x-x\u2032 ) \u2062v\u2062 ( x\u2032 ) +w ) If we are able to solve Equation 27 for the rescaled activity profile v\u2062 ( x ) , we can use Equation 29 to calculate \u03b1 . We can then maximize \u03b1 with respect to g and w: this yields the maximal value \u03b1c for which retrieval solutions can be found . These equations are valid in general and have to be solved numerically . Here we present the results for the case of one-dimensional manifolds and interactions given by the exponential kernel of Equation 36 . In this case , we have ( 30 ) \u27e8\u27e8K2\u2062 ( x-x\u2032 ) \u27e9\u27e9= ( 1+\u03b32 ) \u2062\u27e8\u27e8KS2\u2062 ( x-x\u2032 ) \u27e9\u27e9 . where KS\u2062 ( x-x\u2032 ) =e-|x-x\u2032| is the symmetric component of the kernel . A simple approximation , illustrated in appendix F along with the detailed solution procedure , allows to decouple the dependence of \u03b1c on \u03b3 and L , with the former given by the spatial variance given by Equation 30 and the latter by the solution of Equations 27 and 29 in the \u03b3=0 case . We therefore have: ( 31 ) \u03b1c\u2062 ( L , \u03b3 ) \u223c\u03b1c\u2062 ( L , 0 ) / ( 1+\u03b32 ) The storage capacity is plotted in Figure 8 ( a ) as a function of \u03b3 and L . For sparse maps and small values of the asymmetry , the capacity scales as ( 32 ) \u03b1c\u223c-1ln\u2061 ( 1/L ) \u2062 ( 1+\u03b32 ) The scaling with 1/L is the same found by Battaglia and Treves , 1998 in the analysis of the symmetric case , as expected: for \u03b3=0 the two models are equivalent . The presence of asymmetry decreases the capacity , but does not have a catastrophic effect: the decrease is continuous and scales with a power of \u03b3 . There is therefore a wide range of values of asymmetry and map sparsity in which a large number of dynamic manifolds can be stored and retrieved . To estimate the storage capacity for a fully connected network , we proceed with numerical simulations . For a network of fixed size N , and for given \u03b3 , L and number of maps p , we run a number of simulations NS , letting the network evolve from a random initial configuration . We consider a simulation to have performed a successful retrieval if the global overlap ( 33 ) m\u03bc=1N2\u2062\u2211i\u2260jVi\u2062Vj\u2062KS\u2062 ( xi\u03bc-xj\u03bc ) that quantifies the coherence of the activity with map \u03bc , is large for one map \u03bc* ( at least 95% of the overlap value obtained in the case of a single map ) and low in all others maps \u03bc\u2260\u03bc* . We then define the retrieval probability as pr=NR/NS , where NR is the number of observed retrievals . We repeat the process varying the storage load , that\u00a0is the number of stored manifolds p . As p is increased , the system reaches a transition point , at which the retrieval probability rapidly goes to zero . This transition is illustrated , for various values of \u03b3 , in Figure 8 ( b ) . The number of maps pc at which the probability reaches zero defines the storage capacity \u03b1c\u2062 ( \u03b3 , L ) =pc\u2062 ( \u03b3 , L ) /N . Repeating this procedure for a range of values of \u03b3 and L , we obtain the plots shown in Figure 8 ( c ) , for networks encoding one dimensional and two dimensional dynamical memories . The first thing that can be noticed is that the network can store a large number of maps in the fully connected case as well , for a wide range of \u03b3 and L . A network with size in the order of ten thousand neurons could store from tens up to hundreds of dynamical memories . The capacity for one dimensional attractors is higher than the one for their two dimensional counterparts . This is in line with what was found for symmetric networks ( Battaglia and Treves , 1998 ) . Finally , we see that the peak of the capacity is found not only for intermediate values of map sparsity \u2013 again in line with what is known from the symmetric case \u2013 but also for intermediate values of the coefficient \u03b3 . This shows that moderate values of asymmetry can be beneficial for the storage of multiple continuous attractors , a non-trivial phenomenon that may be crucial for the memory capacity of biological networks . In particular this suggests that the natural tendency of the neural activity to show a rich spontaneous dynamics not only does not hinder the possibility for multiple memories to coexist in the same population , but can be a crucial ingredient for the correct functioning of memory mechanisms . \n The results presented show how a continuous attractor neural network with memory-dependent asymmetric components in the connectivity can function as a dynamic memory . Our model is simple enough to be treated analytically , robustly produces dynamic retrieval for a large range of the relevant parameters and shows a storage capacity that is comparable to \u2013 and in some cases higher than \u2013 the capacity for static continuous attractors . The analytical solution of the single manifold case shows that the interaction between the strength of the asymmetry and the velocity of the shift can be modulated by global features of the network activity such as its sparsity . This makes the network able to retrieve at different velocities in different regimes , without necessarily requiring short term synaptic modifications . The dependence of the retrieval speed from the sparsity of the activity yields a testable prediction in the context of hippocampal replay: faster reactivations are to be expected in association with an increase in the excitability of the population . The insensitivity of the general features of the dynamics to the fine details of the shape of the interactions suggests that this mechanism could robustly emerge from learning or self organization processes in the presence of noise . The quantitative analysis of the learning process needed to effectively memorize low-dimensional dynamic manifolds is an interesting open direction , which goes beyond the scope of this work . However , the asymmetric Hebbian plasticity rule used here provides a simple and biologically realistic starting point . Our analysis shows that the simple introduction of an aysmmetric Hebbian plasticity rule is sufficient to describe a dynamic memory able to store and retrieve multiple manifolds with different speeds , and it can incorporate interactions between them , producing the chained retrieval of a sequence of continuous memories . The central result of the paper is the quantification of the storage capacity for dynamic continuous attractors , that we find to be large in magnitude , only mildly impacted by the asymmetry in diluted networks , and even higher than the capacity for static attractors in fully connected networks with moderate degrees of asymmetry . The storage capacity of out of equilibrium continuous attractors has been calculated , in a different scenario , by Zhong et al . , 2020 . The authors considered the case of an external signal driving the activity bump along the attractor , in a network of binary neurons , and proceeded to calculate the storage capacity with several assumptions that allowed to model the interference of multiple maps as thermal noise . Interestingly , their main result is broadly compatible with what we show here: in the highly diluted regime the velocity of the external signal has a mild \u2013 detrimental \u2013 effect on the capacity . This hints that out of equilibrium effects could show some form of universality across different network models and implementations of the shift mechanism . Moreover , a high capacity for dynamical sequences has shown to be achievable also in the case of discrete items ( Gillett et al . , 2020 ) . Together these results suggest that the introduction of a temporal structure is compatible with the functioning of autoassociative memory in recurrent networks , and they open the way to the use of attractor models for the quantitative analysis of complex memory phenomena , such as hippocampal replay and memory schemata . The model we propose suggests that the tendency of the activity to move in the neural population is a natural feature of networks with asymmetric connectivity , when the asymmetry is organized along a direction in a low dimensional manifold , and that static memories could be the exception rather than the rule . Indeed , Mehta et al . , 2000 have shown that place fields can become more asymmetric in the course of spatial learning , demonstrating that the idea that symmetry emerges from an averaging of trajectory-dependent effects ( Sharp , 1991 ) does not always hold true . The structural role of the asymmetry has important implications for the analysis methods used to describe the activity of large populations of neurons , which often rely on the assumption of symmetry in the interactions ( e . g . in the analysis of pairwise correlations ) or equilibrium of the neural activity ( e . g . the standard inverse Ising inference ) . In most of the two- and three-dimensional cases analysed here , the asymmetry is constant along a single direction in each attractor . This can describe the situation in which the temporal evolution of the memory is structured along a certain dimension , and free to diffuse , without energy costs , in the remaining ones . The description of several one-dimensional trajectories embedded in a two dimensional or three dimensional space requires a position-dependent asymmetric component . A systematic analysis of this situation is left for future analysis . However , the simple case of two intersecting trajectories embedded in a 2D map , analysed here , provides a proof of concept that several intersecting trajectories can be correctly retrieved , provided that the activity bump is sufficiently elongated in the direction of the trajectory . A progressive elongation of the place fields in the running direction has been observed in rats running on a linear track ( Mehta et al . , 1997 ) , and our analysis predicts that an analogous effect would be observed also in open-field environments , when restricting the analysis to trajectories in the same running direction . Another challenge is posed by the evidence that replayed sequences can be organized both forward and backward in time ( Foster and Wilson , 2006 ) . The model in its current formulation can produce the retrieval of a given sequence either forward or backward , but cannot alternate between the two . This suggests that , if replay relies on asymmetric connections , the hippocampus would have to use different representations for the forward and the backward component . The fact that a change in reward uniquely modulates backward replay ( Ambrose et al . , 2016 ) provides some evidence in this direction , but this question remains open to experimental investigation . The dynamical retrieval of the model generalizes , in the framework of attractor networks , the idea of cognitive maps , incorporating a temporal organization in the low-dimensional manifold encoding the structure of the memory . This feature is reminiscent of the idea of memory schemata \u2013 constructs that can guide and constrain our mental activity when we reminisce about the past , imagine future or fictional scenarios or let our minds free to wander ( Ciaramelli and Treves , 2019 ) . The use of the present model to describe memory schemata will require further steps , such as an account of the interaction between hippocampus and neocortex , and the expansion of the mechanism describing the transition between different dynamical memories . Nevertheless , the idea of dynamic retrieval of a continuous manifold and the integration of the model presented here with effective models of cortical memory networks ( Boboeva et al . , 2018 ) open promising perspectives . Finally , the full analytical description of a densely connected asymmetric attractor network is a challenge that remains open , and can yield valuable insights on the workings of the neural circuits underlying memory ."}

Here , we investigate the emergence of tissue-scale patterns of cell shape and mechanical tissue stress in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc during larval development . Using quantitative analysis of the cellular dynamics , we reveal a pattern of radially oriented cell rearrangements that is coupled to the buildup of tangential cell elongation . Developing a laser ablation method , we map tissue stresses and extract key parameters of tissue mechanics . We present a continuum theory showing that this pattern of cell morphology and tissue stress can arise via self-organization of a mechanical feedback that couples cell polarity to active cell rearrangements . The predictions of this model are supported by knockdown of MyoVI , a component of mechanosensitive feedback . Our work reveals a mechanism for the emergence of cellular patterns in morphogenesis . \n During morphogenesis , tissues with complex morphologies are formed from the collective interplay of many cells . This process involves spatial patterns of signaling activity , and previous work has discovered mechanisms for generating tissue-scale patterns of activity in signaling pathways such as Hedgehog , TGF\u03b2 , and Wnt ( Green and Sharpe , 2015 ) . In addition , patterns of cellular morphology arise during morphogenesis . Such patterns can be important for ensuring the function of the resulting tissue . For example , the compound eye of Drosophila consists of hundreds of ommatidia organized in a precise hexagonal array that is required to fully sample the visual field ( Kumar , 2012 ) . Patterns of cellular morphology that arise during morphogenesis can also guide the morphogenetic processes itself . For example , spatial patterns of cell morphology emerge during growth of the Drosophila larval imaginal discs , which are precursors of adult tissues ( Aegerter-Wilmsen et al . , 2010; Condic et al . , 1991; Legoff et al . , 2013; Mao et al . , 2013 ) . These patterns have been proposed to be involved in the eversion process , during which these flattened epithelial sacs turn themselves inside out when the animal transitions from larva to pupa ( Condic et al . , 1991 ) . While extensive work has studied the emergence of biochemical signaling patterns , how patterns of cellular morphology arise during tissue development is poorly understood . Here , we investigate tissue-scale patterning of cell morphology in the Drosophila larval wing imaginal disc , which has a geometry that is ideal for studying spatial patterns of epithelial cell morphology . We focus specifically on the cell shape patterns in the central \u2018pouch\u2019 region , which is the precursor of the adult wing blade . To a good approximation , this region is planar and ellipsoidal . Cells near the center have smaller cell areas and are more isotropic in shape , whereas cells near the periphery have larger cell areas and are elongated tangentially ( Aegerter-Wilmsen et al . , 2010; Legoff et al . , 2013; Mao et al . , 2013 ) . Cell shape has been correlated with mechanical stress: tangentially oriented bonds of elongated cells in the periphery are under higher tension than radially oriented bonds ( Legoff et al . , 2013 ) . It has been previously proposed that this pattern of cell morphology in the wing pouch could stem from differential proliferation: if the center grows faster than the rest , the resulting area pressure could stretch peripheral cells tangentially ( Mao et al . , 2013 ) . Indeed , there is evidence to suggest that cells divide slightly faster closer to the center during very early stages ( before 80hr after egg laying , AEL ) . It was suggested that this early growth differential is sufficient to account for the persistence of the cell morphology pattern through the remaining\u00a0\u223c40hr of development . However , it has since been shown that cell rearrangements occur ( Dye et al . , 2017; Heller et al . , 2016 ) , which could relax stress patterns once growth has become uniform . Furthermore , stress patterns may even relax during homogeneous growth in the absence of cell rearrangements ( Ranft et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , it remains unclear how cell morphology patterns generated early by differential growth could be maintained through later stages , and alternative mechanisms for the establishment of these patterns must be considered . Here , we measure the spatial patterns of cell morphology , cell divisions , and cell rearrangements during the middle of the third larval instar ( starting at 96hr AEL ) . We quantify the pattern of tangential cell elongation and show that it becomes stronger over time , even though growth is spatially uniform and cell rearrangements are frequent . Strikingly , this change in tangential cell elongation is coupled to a radially biased pattern of cell neighbor exchanges . Using a physical model of tissue dynamics , we show that active patterning of radial cell neighbor exchanges can account for the observed morphology patterns in the absence of differential growth . Lastly , using a combination of experiment and theory , we provide evidence that this active patterning could be self-organized by mechanosensitive feedback . \n Cell morphology patterns in the wing disc have been previously analyzed using static images ( Aegerter-Wilmsen et al . , 2010; Legoff et al . , 2013; Mao et al . , 2013 ) . However , relating cell morphology patterns to patterns of growth , cell divisions , and cell rearrangements requires dynamic data . We therefore performed long-term timelapse imaging of growing explanted wing discs using our previously described methods ( Dye et al . , 2017 ) , starting at 96hr AEL and continuing for \u223c13hr of imaging . We used Ecadherin-GFP as an apical junction marker ( Figure 1A ) . To quantify cell morphology , we averaged apical cell area and cell elongation locally in space , using data from five wing discs , and in time using \u223c2hr intervals . Over the course of the 13hr time-lapse , the qualitative features of the morphological patterns do not change . Therefore , in Figure 1B\u2013C , we present the spatial patterns calculated for the middle timepoint . Cell area is represented as a color code . Cell elongation is characterized by a tensor Q , which defines an axis and a strength of elongation and is represented by bars in Figure 1C ( see Materials and methods , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B; Etournay et al . , 2015; Merkel et al . , 2017 ) . To quantify the radial symmetry of this pattern , we first determined the center of symmetry ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 and Materials and methods ) . We then introduce a polar coordinate system at the center with the radial coordinate r and present the radial projection Qrr of the cell elongation tensor as a color code in Figure 1C ( see also Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This figure highlights the pattern of tangential cell elongation , with cells elongating on average perpendicular to the radial axis ( blue in Figure 1C ) . It also reveals that this pattern is interrupted around the Dorsal-Ventral ( DV ) boundary , where cells are elongated parallel to this boundary ( red in Figure 1C ) . We quantify this region separately ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) and exclude it from our analysis of the circular patterns ( Figure 1D\u2013F ) . The Anterior-Posterior ( AP ) boundary also affects cell morphology ( Landsberg et al . , 2009 ) , but the effect is weaker and more variable at this stage; thus , we do not quantify it separately . The spatial maps of cell morphology reveal that both cell area and cell elongation magnitude are largest at the periphery and decrease toward the center ( Figure 1B\u2013C ) . We quantified this radial gradient in cell area and observe that cell area ranges from \u223c3\u22127\u03bcm2 when moving toward the periphery ( Figure 1E ) . We also observe a radial gradient in cell elongation starting from Qrr\u22480 at r=10 \u03bcm and extending to about Qrr\u2248-0 . 1 at r=40 \u03bcm ( Figure 1F ) . The negative value corresponds to tangential elongation ( Figure 1C ) . When evaluated over the timelapse , we find that these radial gradients grow slightly more pronounced over time ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C\u2013D ) . As previously proposed , differential growth can generate such patterns of cell elongation ( Mao et al . , 2013 ) . However , indirect metrics of tissue growth in vivo do not indicate that differential growth still occurs at this later stage ( Mao et al . , 2013 ) . We directly measured the spatial pattern of growth during timelapse . Cell division rate has been previously used as an indicator of growth; however , tissue growth actually results from a combination of cell division , cell area changes , and cell extrusions ( Figure 1G ) . Thus , we evaluated the spatial pattern ( Figure 1H , I , K , L ) and radial profiles ( Figure 1J , M ) of total tissue growth and its cellular contributions . These data show that tissue area growth , as well as cell division rate , are to a good approximation independent of the distance to the center . In summary , we quantified cell morphology patterns in mid-third instar wing explants during live imaging . We confirm previous static observations of the pattern and further identify a region around the DV boundary with a morphological pattern that differs from the rest of the wing pouch . We quantify the radial gradients in cell area and cell elongation existing outside of the DV boundary region and show that they strengthen in time in the absence of differential growth , raising the question of what mechanism underlies the persistence of these cell morphology patterns during mid to late stages of wing growth . To directly relate the observed cell morphology patterns with cell rearrangements , we next analyzed the spatial patterns in cellular contributions to tissue shear ( Figure 2A ) . Tissue shear can be decomposed into contributions from cell divisions , cell elongation changes , T1 transitions , and so-called correlation effects ( Etournay et al . , 2015; Merkel et al . , 2017 ) . Here , correlation effects result mainly from correlated fluctuations in cell elongation and cell rotation ( see Appendix 3 and Merkel et al . , 2017 ) . We find that the spatial patterns of tissue growth and its cellular contributions exhibit overall anisotropies perpendicular to the DV boundary , as reported previously ( Dye et al . , 2017 ) . In addition , the patterns of cell elongation changes and T1 transitions can be described as a superposition of a uniformly oriented pattern and an approximately radial or tangential pattern ( Figure 2C\u2013D ) . To determine the magnitude of the radial or tangential patterns in all quantities , we quantified their average radial projections as cumulative plots over time ( Figure 2B ) . The radial component of tissue shear is small , and cell divisions do not contribute to radial tissue shear . In contrast , we observe a pronounced buildup of a tangential pattern of cell elongation accompanied by a radial pattern of T1 transitions and of correlation effects . As shown above ( Figure 1J ) , tissue area growth does not have a radial gradient and thus does not contribute to the increase in tangential cell elongation that we observe at this time ( Figure 2A\u2013B , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C\u2013D ) . Furthermore , we observe numerous T1 transitions ( on average 1 . 0 cell-1 hr-1 ) , and their radially\u00a0biased orientation increases rather than relaxes tangential cell elongation ( Figure 2E\u2013F ) . Thus , we are not observing the relaxation of a pattern of cell elongation caused by early differential growth . Rather , our data support a model whereby a radially patterned morphogenetic cue actively biases the direction of T1 transitions and consequently the complementary pattern of cell shape changes . We next apply a biophysical model to determine whether radially patterned T1 transitions could account for the observed cell morphology patterns in the wing disc . This model takes into account the interplay of T1 transitions , cell shape changes , and tissue shear in a continuum description ( Etournay et al . , 2015; Popovi\u0107 et al . , 2017 ) . Active anisotropic force-generating processes that bias cell rearrangements in the tissue , such as polarization of the actomyosin cytoskeleton , are captured by a nematic cell polarity q , defined by a magnitude and an orientation axis . We propose that such a patterning cue leads to the radially oriented pattern of T1 transitions we observe in the wing disc . In our model , we consider the spatial patterns of tissue shear rate v~ , the patterns of cell shape Q , and the patterns of cell rearrangements R , which have nematic symmetry and are represented by traceless symmetric tensors that describe the magnitude and orientation . Tissue shear is defined as a velocity gradient tensor that results from a combination of cell shape changes and cell rearrangements ( Etournay et al . , 2015; Merkel et al . , 2017 ) : ( 1 ) v~=DQDt+R Here , DQ/Dt is a co-rotational time derivative of Q , and the shear due to cell rearrangements R includes contributions from T1 transitions , cell divisions and extrusions , and also correlation effects . Tissue material properties are described by constitutive equations for the tissue shear stress \u03c3~ and the shear due to cell rearrangements R ( Figure 3A\u2013B ) : ( 2 ) \u03c3~=2KQ+\u03b6q ( 3 ) R=\u20051\u03c4Q\u2005+\u2005\u03bb\u2005q Here , the shear stress tensor \u03c3~ is the sum of the elastic and active stress . The elastic stress is associated with cell elongation Q and characterized by the shear elastic modulus K . The active stress associated with the cell polarity cue q ( Figure 3A ) is described by the coefficient \u03b6 . The shear rate due to cell rearrangements R given by Equation 3 is driven in part by shear stress , and therefore depends on the cell elongation Q , and in part by active processes that are oriented by the nematic cell polarity q ( Figure 3B ) . \u03c4 is a relaxation time for cell rearrangements over which elastic stresses are relaxed , and \u03bb is the rate of cell rearrangements driven by cell polarity . In this coarse-grained picture , subcellular processes are captured by effective coefficients . For simplicity , we do not include dissipative processes on cellular scales , such as cytoskeletal viscosity or cell-cell friction . Such dissipative processes are relevant on short timescales and are small in comparison with elastic stresses on tissue relevant timescales . To discuss the wing disc , we consider a radially symmetric geometry and average the oriented quantities after projection onto the radial axis . Radial tissue shear is small compared to that associated with cell shape changes and T1 transitions during our observed time window ( Figure 2B ) . We therefore consider a steady state with v~rr=0 , DQrr/Dt\u2005=0 , and Rrr=0 . In this case , cell elongation becomes: ( 4 ) Qrr=-\u03c4\u03bb\u2005qrr Thus , we find that the steady state cell elongation pattern is a result of cell rearrangements that are oriented by the cell polarity cue q ( Figure 3C\u2013D ) . Note that our data show that the wing disc is not exactly at steady state: cells slowly change their shape and rearrange radially ( Figure 2A\u2013B ) . However , as we show in Appendix 1 part 1-2 , Equation 4 holds to a good approximation . Can the radial pattern of T1 transitions defined by q also explain the observed radial profile of cell area ( Figure 1B , E ) ? To answer this question , we then considered force balances in the tissue . We consider tissue area pressure: ( 5 ) P=\u2212K\u00af\u2005ln ( aa0 ) where P is the difference in pressure from a reference value , K\u00af is tissue area compressibility , a is the average cell area , and a0 is a reference cell area . As pressure increases , cell area decreases . To calculate the cell area profile , we again approximate the wing pouch as a radially symmetric disc . In the radially symmetric geometry , force balance can be expressed as: ( 6 ) \u2202rP=\u2202r\u03c3~rr+2r\u03c3~rr A radial profile of pressure determined from this equation implies a radial pattern of cell area via Equation 5 ( see Figure 3C\u2013E and Appendix 1 part 1-2 ) . To test this implication , we first quantify the radial profile of cell elongation Qrr to estimate the profile of qrr using Equation 4 ( Figure 3F ) . We represent the cell elongation data in a functional form using an empirical power law that is fit to the data . Then , using this functional form in Equations 2 , 5 , and 6 , we solve for the cell area profile ( Figure 3G and Appendix 1 part 1-2 ) . Finally , we show that this function can account for the observed pattern of cell area ( see Figure 3G ) . From this analysis , we conclude that the cell morphology patterns observed in the wing disc could be generated by radially\u00a0biased cell rearrangements . Next , we test whether the stress profile predicted by the model ( Equation 2 ) exists in the tissue , and we measure key mechanical parameters of the model . Later , we address the potential molecular origin of the cell polarity cue orienting the cell rearrangements . Our model predicts a stress pattern in the wing disc that results from active processes that are radially oriented by a cell polarity cue . To compare this prediction to experiment , we infer tissue stress using laser ablation . Tissue stress has been estimated previously by laser ablation techniques that are based on determining the initial retraction velocity ( Bonnet et al . , 2012; Etournay et al . , 2015; Farhadifar et al . , 2007; Legoff et al . , 2013; Mao et al . , 2013; Shivakumar and Lenne , 2016 ) . However , to compare theory and experiment , ideally one should measure quantities that are well-captured by the model . Therefore , instead of using initial retraction velocity , we perform circular cuts and analyze the final , relaxed position of the inner and outer elliptical contours of tissue formed by the cut ( Figure 4A , Appendix 2 ) . From the size and the anisotropy of the cut , we can infer anisotropic and isotropic tissues stress , normalized by the respective elastic constants , as well as the ratio of elastic constants ( see Appendix 2 ) . Furthermore , we can also infer the existence of polarity-driven stress . We name this method ESCA ( Elliptical Shape after Circular Ablation ) . We perform local measurements of tissue mechanics by cutting the tissue in the smallest possible circle that would still allow us to measure the shape of the inner piece left by the cut ( radius = 7\u03bcm , encircling \u223c5\u221215 cells , Figure 4A ) . To relate measurements of tissue stress to cell elongation , we calculate the average cell elongation in the ablated region before it is cut ( Figure 4A ) . In Figure 4B , we present the measured cell elongation and shear stress tensors at the position of ablation . We find that local average cell elongation correlates well with the principal direction of shear stress . Also , we observe that the cells in the band around the DV boundary , which are exposed to high Wg and Notch signaling , have different mechanical properties than elsewhere in the tissue . Near the DV boundary , cells elongate less than outside this region for comparable amounts of stress ( Figure 4B and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B , E ) . The ratio of elastic constants in this region is also smaller: near the DV boundary 2K/K\u00af=2 . 3\u00b10 . 3 , whereas outside this region , 2K/K\u00af=3 . 4\u00b10 . 4 ( see also Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C , F ) . We focus hereafter on the radial patterns of elongation and stress outside of the DV boundary region . The relationship between cell elongation and stress normalized by the elastic modulus has a slope 1 in the absence of polarity-driven stress ( see Equation 2 ) . We observe a much smaller slope for this relationship in our data ( Figure 4C ) , indicating that polarity-driven stress is significant . We now use these data to estimate the parameters of our mechanical model . We write the shear stress defined in Equation 2 in terms of cell elongation and cell rearrangements , eliminating the orientational cue qrr using Equation 3 . For the radial components , we have: ( 7 ) \u03c3~rr=2K*Qrr+2K-K*\u03c4Rrrwhere K* = 1-\u03b6/ ( 2K\u03c4\u03bb ) K is an effective shear elastic coefficient . The difference between K* and K depends on the parameters \u03b6 and \u03bb associated with the nematic cell polarity . We fit Equation 7 to the data and find K*/K=0 . 05\u00b10 . 02 and ( 1-K*/K ) \u03c4Rrr=0 . 011\u00b10 . 002 ( Figure 4C , see Appendix 1 part 3 ) . Combined with data from Figure 1 , we find an estimate for the tissue relaxation time \u03c4=2\u00b12\u00a0hr , which is roughly consistent with that found during pupal morphogenesis ( Etournay et al . , 2015 ) . From our data , we can also infer the radial profile of tissue area pressure , revealing that pressure increases toward the center ( Figure 4D and Appendix 1 part 3 ) . This finding is consistent with the observed cell area profile , with smaller cell areas toward the center ( Figure 1B , E ) . In sum , we find a stress profile in the wing disc that is consistent with the observed measurements of both cell elongation and area . Further , we use these data to measure certain parameters of our biophysical model , including the tissue relaxation timescale and the effective shear elastic coefficient . In our model , the radial orientation cue is required to generate the observed patterns of cell morphology , cell rearrangement , and tissue stress . Candidates for such an orientational cue are the planar cell polarity pathways ( PCP ) , which are groups of interacting proteins that polarize within the plane of the epithelium . There are two well-characterized PCP pathways: Fat and Core ( Butler and Wallingford , 2017; Eaton , 2003 ) . In the wing , these systems form tissue-scale polarity patterns during growth ( Brittle et al . , 2012; Merkel et al . , 2014; Sagner et al . , 2012 ) and are required to position the hairs and cuticle ridges on the adult wing ( Adler et al . , 1998; Doyle et al . , 2008; Eaton , 2003; Gubb and Garc\u00eda-Bellido , 1982; Hogan et al . , 2011 ) . To determine whether either of these pathways could function as the orientational cue described in our model , we analyzed cell elongation patterns after their removal . We perturbed the Fat pathway using nub-Gal4 to drive the expression of RNAi constructs targeting both fat ( ft ) and dachs ( d ) in the pouch region throughout the third larval instar . This perturbation results in almost complete loss of Dachsous from the apical membrane , and any residual signal is no longer polarized , confirming the loss of PCP ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B ) . Furthermore , we observe a suppression of tissue growth upon ft+d double RNAi knockdown ( visible at the end of larval development in Figure 5A and in the resulting adult wings in Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C ) , consistent with previous work on the loss of both Dachs and Fat ( Cho and Irvine , 2004 ) . Nonetheless , the pattern of tangential cell elongation persists to the end of larval development ( Figure 5A\u2013C ) . Using scaled coordinates , we find that the radial profiles of cell elongation in ft+d RNAi and control wings are similar ( Figure 5D ) . We perturbed the Core PCP pathway using a previously characterized null mutation in prickle ( pk30 ) , which causes defects in adult wing hair orientation ( Gubb et al . , 1999 ) . We found that the cell elongation pattern in the pk mutant is similar to the wild-type control ( Figure 5E\u2013I ) . In the pk mutant , the region of tangential cell elongation extends even further into the center than in control wings . We conclude that the tangential cell elongation pattern persists in the absence of either PCP pathway . This result excludes these pathways as orienting cues for the cell elongation patterns . We have shown that perturbing PCP pathways does not affect the radial patterns of morphology , raising the question of how orientational cues might arise . In previous sections , we have considered the orientational cue to be provided by a cell polarity system that is independently patterned . However , cell polarity in general would be affected by stresses in the tissue . Indeed , there are many examples of cells polarizing in response to mechanical stress ( Duda et al . , 2019; Hirashima and Adachi , 2019; Ladoux et al . , 2016; Ohashi et al . , 2017 ) . Here , we show that introducing mechanosensitive feedback to the model of tissue mechanics can give rise to spontaneous emergence of the cell polarity cue ( Figure 6 ) . Mechanosensitivity is incorporated into our model of tissue mechanics through a dynamic equation for the orientational cue q that becomes stress-dependent: ( 8 ) dqdt=\u22121\u03c4qq\u2212\u03bc\u03c3~\u2212\u03b1|q|2q+D\u22072q Here , \u03c4q is a relaxation timescale for q , \u03bc is a mechanosensitive feedback strength , the coefficient \u03b1>0 ensures stability , and D is a coupling strength locally aligning orientational cues . Now , Equation 8 provides a mechanosensitive feedback to Equations 1 , 2 and 3 . These combined equations show a novel behavior . Specifically , the orientational cue can emerge spontaneously by self-organization ( Figure 6A\u2013B ) . Beyond a critical value \u03bcc of the mechanosensitive feedback strength \u03bc , an isotropic tissue with q=0 is no longer stable , and a state with an orientational cue q\u22600 emerges instead ( Figure 6B and Appendix 1 part 4 ) . The magnitude of this spontaneous polarization is |q|=q0 , where q02= ( \u03c4q\u03bc ( 2K\u03c4\u03bb-\u03b6 ) -1 ) / ( \u03b1\u03c4q ) , where a positive coefficient \u03b1 is needed to stabilize the polarized state . By this mechanism , the anisotropic cue introduced earlier in our model can be locally generated by mechanosensitive self-organization and does not require the existence of pre-patterned polarity cues . To generate a large-scale pattern from locally generated anisotropic cues , they need to be aligned in neighboring regions . This local alignment is captured in Equation 8 by the orientation coupling term with strength D , which is similar to alignment terms found in anisotropic physical systems , such as liquid crystals ( Gennes and Prost , 1993; J\u00fclicher et al . , 2018; Marchetti et al . , 2013 ) . To discuss cell morphology profiles in the wing disc , we consider a simplified tissue model with radial symmetry , where the rate of radial cell rearrangement Rrr is given ( as estimated in Appendix 1 part 2 ) and the cell shape pattern and tissue stress pattern are calculated . Using a fit of cell elongation to the experimental data , we find a set of parameter values that accounts for the observed cell elongation patterns in the wing disc ( Table 1 , Appendix 1 , Figure 6C ) . From this cell elongation pattern also follows the cell area pattern ( as described above , Figure 3 ) . We conclude that our mechanosensitive model can account for the radial pattern of cell morphology in the wing disc . Due to the relatively large number of parameters used to fit a single experimental curve , there are large uncertainties when estimating parameter values . Nonetheless , these uncertainties do not affect the qualitative prediction that a reduction in mechanosensitivity \u03bc would lead to less polarization and thereby reduced cell elongation ( see Appendix 1 part 4 ) . We next test this prediction of our model experimentally . In order to test our prediction that the reduction of mechanosensitivity will reduce the magnitude of cell elongation , we used RNAi to reduce the levels of Myosin VI ( MyoVI ) , a molecular motor implicated in mechanosignaling . MyoVI , encoded by jaguar ( jar ) in Drosophila , is an upstream component of a Rho-dependent signaling pathway that reorganizes the actin-myosin cytoskeleton in response to mechanical stress ( Acharya et al . , 2018 ) . Experiments in wing discs also indicate that mechanosensation involves Rho polarization and signaling ( Duda et al . , 2019 ) . We performed RNAi targeting\u00a0MyoVI in the wing pouch using nub-Gal4 and evaluated cell morphology at the end of larval development ( \u223c120hr AEL ) . We observe a clear reduction in the magnitude of tangential cell elongation as compared to wild type at this stage ( Figure 7A\u2013D , Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . In addition , our model predicts that such reduction of cell elongation would result in an increase of cell area in the wing ( Equations 1-6 ) . The observed pattern of increased cell area upon reducing MyoVI levels with RNAi is consistent with this prediction ( Figure 7E\u2013F ) . Therefore , the qualitative predictions of our model upon reducing the mechanosensitive feedback strength \u03bc are confirmed by the experimental downregulation of the mechanosensitive motor MyoVI . \n Our work shows that the spatial pattern of T1 transitions is an integral part of the emergence of tissue organization during wing development . In contrast to situations such as germband extension , where T1 transitions exhibit clearly discernible patterns , the patterns of T1 transitions in the wing disc have been elusive . Many T1 transitions occur in the tissue in seemingly random orientations . However , on average , they exhibit a spatial pattern . We revealed these patterns by quantifying the nematics of T1 transitions and cell shape changes using the previously-described triangle method ( Merkel et al . , 2017 ) and then quantified them with radial averaging ( Figure 2A\u2013B ) . In this way , we revealed that a radial pattern of T1 transitions is linked to a tangential pattern of cell elongation . Given this radial pattern of T1 cell rearrangements , the observed cell morphology pattern follows from a continuum tissue model based on a radially\u00a0oriented nematic cell polarity field ( Figure 3 ) . The polarity-oriented radial T1s create a cell shape pattern with corresponding patterns of tissue stress and tissue area pressure . The 2D area pressure is higher in the center and is lower toward the periphery . Note that this pressure profile does not rely on differential proliferation , as was previously proposed ( Mao et al . , 2013 ) but instead relies on a radial pattern of T1 transitions . We test our model using a novel circular laser ablation method . This method allows us to determine specific combinations of tissue parameters . In particular , we estimate the ratio of elastic constants 2K/K\u00af=3 . 4\u00b10 . 4 and K*/K=0 . 05\u00b10 . 02 , as well as the cell shape relaxation timescale \u03c4=2\u00b12hr . This analysis raised the question of which nematic cell polarity cues guide the cell rearrangement and cell elongation patterns . PCP pathways are required for the proper orientation of T1 transitions in other contexts ( Bosveld et al . , 2012 ) . However , we found that neither of the two known PCP pathways in the wing are required for the observed tangential cell elongation patterns ( Figure 5 ) . We instead show that an orientation cue can arise through self-organization via mechanosensitivity and identify MyoVI as a key molecular player . Cell polarity cues can emerge via mechanosensitive feedback by transforming mechanical cues into chemical anisotropies . Nematic cell polarity can then orient active stresses and thereby amplify the mechanical stimulus ( Figure 6 ) . We introduce this mechanosensitive feedback in our continuum theory , which quantitatively describes the emergence of patterns of cell shape and cell rearrangements . The strength of this mechanosensitive feedback is described by a parameter \u03bc . If \u03bc exceeds a critical value \u03bcc , an orientation cue and elongated cell shapes spontaneously emerge ( Figure 6B ) . This model can account for the observed patterns of cell area and cell elongation in the wing disc and predicts that the reduction of mechanosensitivity will result in reduced cell elongation . To test this prediction , we perturbed a RhoA-dependent mechanotransduction pathway by lowering\u00a0levels\u00a0of an upstream component , MyoVI , using RNAi ( Figure 7 ) . We find a clear phenotype of reduced cell elongation and increased cell areas in the center region , as predicted by our model . In the spatially resolved model , which includes the term coupling polarity orientation of neighboring cells ( Figure 6C ) , a polarity pattern can be induced even below \u03bcc by imposing polarity at the tissue boundaries . Thus , the residual pattern of cell elongation that we observe after removal of MyoVI in the wing pouch could be due to polarity existing outside of this perturbed region . In addition , the residual pattern could also indicate an incomplete knockdown from RNAi or the presence of other mechanosensitive elements in the tissue . Nevertheless , given the clear phenotype that is fully consistent with our model , we propose that the mechanosensitive feedback mechanism is a significant determinant of the cell shape patterns in the wing pouch . Our data , together with the fact that MyoVI is involved in Rho-dependent activation of actin-myosin cytoskeleton ( Acharya et al . , 2018 ) , suggest that MyoVI is a molecular component of the mechanosensitive feedback we describe in our self-organized model . However , the molecular nature of the cue that defines the nematic cell polarity is unknown . This cue may organize the structure or dynamics of the actin-myosin cytoskeleton or the actin-myosin system itself could define nematic cell polarity . Indeed , it has been shown that Myosin II ( MyoII ) localizes to long cell boundaries in the wing ( Legoff et al . , 2013 ) , corresponding to a nematic polarity aligned with the nematic cell polarity q . Also , wing disc stretching experiments have shown that MyoII can polarize in response to exogenous stress in a Rho-dependent manner ( Duda et al . , 2019 ) . Furthermore , it has been suggested that MyoII polarity arises as a consequence of cell stretching and functions as a negative mechanical feedback ( Legoff et al . , 2013 ) , consistent with the role of q in our model . Precisely how the actin-myosin cytoskeleton is affected by MyoVI in this system and how these cytoskeletal elements together guide cell rearrangements in response to anisotropic tissue stresses and cell shape changes remain open questions for future research . Lastly , our laser ablation analysis shows that the region around the DV boundary has a different ratio of elastic constants than the rest of the tissue , which could affect the self-organized pattern formation we describe . Therefore , it will be interesting to study how Wingless/Notch signaling , which defines the DV boundary , may influence the mechanical properties that lead to mechanosensitive self-organization of polarity and morphology . In addition , we observe a richer pattern emerging very late in development ( see Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 , Figure 5 ) , including a region anterior to the AP boundary that is radially elongated . Future research will expand upon the model presented here to explore the dynamics of these patterns . In summary , we used the Drosophila wing disc to identify a mechanism by which tissue morphology can arise from the self-organization of a mechanical feedback coupling cell polarity to active cell rearrangements . This mechanism is general and could be employed in other tissues and organisms to generate patterns of cell shape and cell area . Thus , we hope our work inspires new avenues of research that integrate theory and experiment to understand biological self-organization . \n This study did not generate any new unique reagents .

All experiments were performed with Drosophila melanogaster , using lines that are publicly available and previously published . Our Drosophila lines were fed with a standard media containing cornmeal , molasses agar and yeast extract and grown under a 12hr light/dark cycle . All experiments were performed at 25\u2218C . Both males and females were analyzed , and the sex of the animals was not recorded , as we have no reason to believe there is any sexual dimorphism in the studied phenomenon . To synchronize development , we collected eggs deposited within a defined time window on apple juice agar plates . To do so , we transferred the flies from standard food vials to cages covered by apple juice agar plates containing a dollop of yeast paste for food . After at least 2hr , the plates were replaced , and the timing of collection started . Eggs laid within a \u223c2hr time window were collected by cutting out a piece of the agar and transferring it to a standard food vial . We limited the number of eggs per vial to <15 to avoid crowding . The middle of the time window for egg collection was considered to be 0hr\u00a0AEL . Experiments from timelapse imaging and laser ablation ( Figures 1 , 2 , and 4 ) were captured after explanting at 96hr AEL , whereas those involving RNAi ( Figures 5 and 7 ) were explanted at 110\u2212120hr AEL to allow the maximal amount of time for the RNAi phenotype to emerge .

These are proteins that break down parts of a virus including its DNA or proteins . To evade these defenses , viruses in turn make proteins that block or break down restriction factors . This battle between human and viral proteins determines which types of cells are infected and how quickly a virus can multiply and spread to new cells . HIV produces a protein called Vpr that counteracts a restriction factor found in immune cells called macrophages . However , the identity of the restriction factor targeted by Vpr is a mystery . When Vpr is missing , this unknown restriction factor breaks down a virus protein called Env . Env is a glycoprotein , which is a protein with sugars attached . When Env levels are low , HIV cannot spread to other cells and multiply . Identifying the restriction factor that breaks down Env may lead to new ways of treating and preventing HIV infections . Now , Lubow et al . reveal that the unknown restriction factor in macrophages is a protein called the mannose receptor . This protein binds and destroys proteins containing mannose , a type of sugar found on bacteria and some viruses . The experiments revealed that the mannose receptor grabs mannose on the HIV protein Env . This causes Env to be broken down and stops HIV from spreading . Lubow et al . also find that Vpr works with another protein produced by HIV called Nef to reduce the number of mannose receptors on macrophages . The two proteins do this by targeting different steps in the assembly of mannose receptors , allowing the virus to multiply and spread more efficiently . The experiments suggest that drugs that simultaneously block Vpr and Nef might prevent or suppress HIV infections . More studies are needed to develop and test potential HIV-treatments targeting Vpr and Nef .", "source": "HIV-1 Vpr is necessary for maximal HIV infection and spread in macrophages . Evolutionary conservation of Vpr suggests an important yet poorly understood role for macrophages in HIV pathogenesis . Vpr counteracts a previously unknown macrophage-specific restriction factor that targets and reduces the expression of HIV Env . Here , we report that the macrophage mannose receptor ( MR ) , is a restriction factor targeting Env in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages . Vpr acts synergistically with HIV Nef to target distinct stages of the MR biosynthetic pathway and dramatically reduce MR expression . Silencing MR or deleting mannose residues on Env rescues Env expression in HIV-1-infected macrophages lacking Vpr . However , we also show that disrupting interactions between Env and MR reduces initial infection of macrophages by cell-free virus . Together these results reveal a Vpr-Nef-Env axis that hijacks a host mannose-MR response system to facilitate infection while evading MR\u2019s normal role , which is to trap and destroy mannose-expressing pathogens . \n Vpr is a highly conserved HIV accessory protein that is necessary for optimal replication in macrophages ( Balliet et al . , 1994 ) but its mechanism of action is poorly understood . Studies using human lymphoid tissue ( HLT ) , which are rich in both T cells and macrophages , have found that loss of Vpr decreases virus production ( Rucker et al . , 2004 ) but only when the virus strain used is capable of efficiently infecting macrophages ( Eckstein et al . , 2001 ) . These studies provide evidence that Vpr enhances infection of macrophages and increases viral burden in tissues where macrophages reside . Because Vpr is packaged into the virion ( Cohen et al . , 1990 ) and localizes to the nucleus ( Lu et al . , 1993 ) , it may enhance early viral replication events . However , in mononuclear phagocytes vpr-null virus in which Vpr protein is provided by trans-complementation in the producer cells replicates poorly compared to wild-type virus ( Connor et al . , 1995 ) , indicating that Vpr\u2019s role in the HIV replication cycle continues into late stages . Previous work by our group demonstrated that Vpr counteracts an unidentified macrophage-specific restriction factor that targets Env and Env-containing virions for lysosomal degradation ( Mashiba et al . , 2014; Collins et al . , 2015 ) . This restriction could be conferred to permissive 293T cells by fusing them with MDM to create 293T-MDM heterokaryons . A follow up study demonstrated that by increasing steady state levels of Env , Vpr increases formation of virological synapses between infected MDM and autologous uninfected T cells , enhancing HIV infection of T cells ( Collins et al . , 2015 ) . This enhances spread to T cells and dramatically increases levels of Gag p24 in the culture supernatant . This finding helps explain the paradoxical observations that Vpr is required for maximal infection of T cells in vivo ( Hoch et al . , 1995 ) but numerous studies have shown Vpr only marginally impacts infection of pure T cell cultures in vitro ( e . g . Mashiba et al . , 2014 ) . Our goal in the current study was to identify and characterize the myeloid restriction factor targeting Env that is counteracted by Vpr . We reasoned that macrophage-specific Env-binding proteins , including the carbohydrate binding protein mannose receptor ( MR ) , were candidates . MR is expressed on several types of macrophages in vivo ( Liang et al . , 1996; Linehan et al . , 1999 ) and is known to mediate innate immunity against various pathogens ( Macedo-Ramos et al . , 2014; Subramanian et al . , 2019 ) . MR recognizes mannose-rich structures including high-mannose glycans , which are incorporated in many proteins during synthesis . In eukaryotic cells most high-mannose glycans are cleaved by \u03b1-mannosidases and replaced with complex-type glycans as they transit through the secretory pathway . By contrast , in prokaryotic cells , high-mannose residues remain intact , making them a useful target of pattern recognition receptors including MR . Some viral proteins , including HIV-1 Env , evade mannose trimming ( Coss et al . , 2016 ) and retain enough high-mannose to bind MR ( Trujillo et al . , 2007; Lai et al . , 2009 ) . There is evidence that HIV-1 proteins Nef and Tat decrease expression of MR based on studies performed in monocyte derived macrophages ( MDM ) and the monocytic U937 cell line , respectively ( Caldwell et al . , 2000; Vigerust et al . , 2005 ) . Nef dysregulates MR trafficking using an SDXXL\u03a6 motif in MR\u2019s cytoplasmic tail ( Vigerust et al . , 2005 ) , which is similar to the sequence in CD4\u2019s tail that Nef uses to remove it from the cell surface ( Bresnahan et al . , 1998; Greenberg et al . , 1998; Cluet et al . , 2005 ) . Whether MR or its modulation by viral proteins alters the course of viral replication has not been established . Here we confirm that Nef reduces MR expression in primary human MDM , although in our system , the effect of Nef alone was relatively small . In contrast , we report that co-expression of Vpr and Nef dramatically reduced MR expression . In the absence of both Vpr and Nef , MR levels normalized indicating that Tat did not play a significant , independent role in MR downmodulation . Deleting mannose residues on Env or silencing MR alleviated mannose-dependent interactions between MR and Env and reduced the requirement for Vpr . Although the post-infection interactions between MR and Env reduced Env levels and inhibited viral release , we provide evidence that these same interactions were beneficial for initial infection of MDM . Together these results reveal that mannose residues on Env and the accessory proteins Nef and Vpr are needed for HIV to utilize and then disable an important component of the myeloid innate response against pathogens intended to thwart infection . \n Because we had previously determined that Vpr functions in macrophages to counteract a macrophage specific restriction factor that targets Env , we reasoned that Env-binding proteins selectively expressed by macrophages were potential candidate restriction factors . To determine whether any factors fitting this description were targeted by Vpr , we cultured macrophages under conditions that achieve a saturating infection by both wild-type and Vpr-null mutant viruses ( Figure 1A and B ) . We found that mannose receptor ( MR ) , which is highly expressed on macrophages and has been previously shown to bind Env ( Trujillo et al . , 2007; Fanibunda et al . , 2008; Lai et al . , 2009 ) , was significantly decreased by wild-type HIV 89 . 6 but not by 89 . 6 vpr-null ( Figure 1C and D , p<0 . 01 ) . In contrast , we observed no significant effect of Vpr on the expression of GAPDH . We also observed that stimulator of interferon genes ( STING ) was unaffected by Vpr ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Relative expression of known restriction factors GBP5 and IFITM3 varied in infected MDM from multiple donors ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , but unlike MR they were not consistently reduced in the wild-type condition , indicating they are not targeted by Vpr . To confirm the effect of Vpr on Env during HIV infection of primary human macrophages in which MR was downmodulated , we performed quantitative western blot analysis . As shown in Figure 1E and F , we confirmed that amounts of Vpr sufficient for MR downmodulation were also sufficient for stabilizing expression of Env ( gp160 , gp120 , gp41 ) . Compiled data from nine donors clearly demonstrated results that were similar to our prior publication ( Mashiba et al . , 2014 ) ; under conditions of matched infection in which there was no significant difference in HIV Gag pr55 levels between wild-type and vpr-null infections , all three forms of Env were significantly more abundant in the wild-type infection ( gp160: 4-fold , p<0 . 002; gp120: 6-fold , p<0 . 002; gp41: 3-fold , p<0 . 001 ) . Because an earlier report indicated that Nef decreases surface expression of MR ( Vigerust et al . , 2005 ) , we asked whether Nef was playing a role in MR downmodulation in our systems . Because HIVs lacking Vpr and Nef spread too inefficiently in MDM to observe effects on host proteins by western blot analysis , we utilized a replication defective HIV with a GFP marker ( NL4-3 \u2206GPE-GFP , Figure 2A ) to allow measurement of MR expression via flow cytometry following single-round transduction . This construct has the additional advantage that it eliminates potentially confounding effects of differences between wild-type and mutant HIV viral spread . We generated truncation mutations in nef and vpr and confirmed that these mutations only affected expression of the altered gene product in transfected 293T ( Figure 2B ) . For these experiments , primary MDM were harvested earlier than the experiments described in Figure 1 ( five days versus ten days ) because the viruses could not replicate and the GFP marker allowed identification of transduced cells ( Figure 2C ) . Under these conditions , we found that MR expression was dramatically reduced in a subset of GFP+ cells when both Vpr and Nef were expressed ( Figure 2C\u2013E ) . Both Nef and Vpr contributed to MR downmodulation; loss of function mutation in either Vpr or Nef reduced the severity of MR downmodulation similarly , and there was no statistical difference between MR levels in macrophages expressing either Vpr or Nef alone ( Figure 2E ) . In addition , complete elimination of downmodulation required mutation of both Vpr and Nef ( Figure 2C\u2013E ) . These results indicate that both Vpr and Nef are required for maximal MR downmodulation in HIV-infected macrophages and that neither alone is sufficient . Vpr was previously demonstrated to interact with a cellular co-factor called DCAF1 , a component of the cellular DCAF1-DDB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex . ( Hrecka et al . , 2007; Le Rouzic et al . , 2007; McCall et al . , 2008; Lahouassa et al . , 2016; Wu et al . , 2016; Zhou et al . , 2016 ) . The interaction between Vpr and DCAF1 can be disrupted through a Vpr mutation ( Q65R ) that inhibits many Vpr-dependent functions , including reversal of Env degradation in macrophages ( Mashiba et al . , 2014 ) . To determine whether this mutant is defective at MR downmodulation , we generated the mutation in the NL4-3 \u2206GPE-GFP parent ( Figure 2A ) , confirmed expression in transfected 293T cells ( Figure 2F ) and tested the effect of the mutation on MR levels in macrophages . As expected , we found that in transduced MDM the vpr-Q65R mutant behaves similarly to vpr-null ( Figure 2E ) . These results indicate interactions between Vpr and DCAF1 are required to mediate Vpr\u2019s effects on MR . The differences in MR downmodulation we observed using this system were not due to variations in multiplicity of infection of the different viral constructs as MDM transduced with the mutant viral constructs had roughly similar transduction rates as the parental construct ( Figure 2G ) but demonstrated less MR downmodulation ( Figure 2E ) . To determine whether the relatively modest effect of Nef alone on MR levels was due to using HIV to deliver Nef as compared to an adenoviral vector delivery system used in a prior publication ( Vigerust et al . , 2005 ) , we repeated the experiment using an adenoviral vector expressing Nef . These experiments confirmed that levels of Nef sufficient to downmodulate the HIV receptor , CD4 , on nearly all MDM in the culture achieved only modest effects on MR in a subset of cells ( Figure 2H ) similar to what was observed using the HIV reporter construct ( Figure 2E ) . Thus , Nef and Vpr have modest but significant effects on MR when expressed individually , however the combined effects of both proteins can achieve nearly complete downmodulation at least in a subset of infected cells . While the effect of Nef has been previously reported and found to be due to disruption of MR intracellular trafficking ( Vigerust et al . , 2005 ) , the effect of Vpr on MR is a novel observation . Vpr is known to target cellular proteins involved in DNA repair pathways for proteasomal degradation via interactions with Vpr binding protein [DCAF1 , ( McCall et al . , 2008 ) ] . Using this mechanism , Vpr degrades the uracil deglycosylases UNG2 and SMUG1 in 293T cells following co-transfection ( Schr\u00f6felbauer et al . , 2005; Schr\u00f6felbauer et al . , 2007 ) . To determine whether Vpr directly targets MR using a similar strategy , we co-transfected NL4-3 \u2206GPE-GFP or a vpr-null derivative with expression vectors encoding an UNG2-FLAG fusion protein or MR ( Liu et al . , 2004 ) in 293T cells . We then analyzed expression of MR or UNG2 by flow cytometry and western blot ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We found that Vpr in 293T cells virtually eliminated UNG2 expression when measured by flow cytometry and noticeably reduced UNG2 by western blot . However , Vpr had no effect on expression of MR measured by either method . Thus , we concluded that Vpr does not degrade MR by the direct , proteasomal mechanism it uses to degrade UNG2 . Because MR expression in this system is controlled by a heterologous CMV promoter; the lack of effect by Vpr suggested its action may depend on MR\u2019s native promoter . In addition to targeting proteins for degradation , Vpr also functions to inhibit transcription of genes such as IFNA1 ( Laguette et al . , 2014; Mashiba et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that Vpr may reduce MR expression via inhibition of transcription . To examine this , we assessed transcriptional activity in primary human MDM transduced with the wild-type or Vpr-null reporter virus ( Figure 3A ) using cells isolated based on GFP expression ( Figure 3B ) . We found that the MR gene ( MRC1 ) was consistently reduced in cells transduced by vpr-competent virus compared to cells transduced by vpr-null virus ( Figure 3C and D , p=0 . 001 ) . In contrast , any effects of Vpr on the housekeeping genes ACTB ( \u03b2-actin ) and POL2A ( RNA polymerase 2A ) were significantly smaller ( Figure 3D , p<0 . 01 ) . Similar results were obtained when each gene was normalized to ACTB instead of GAPDH ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B ) . The magnitude of the effect on MRC1 is consistent with prior reports of HIV-1 inhibiting MRC1 transcription\u2212 though this was not previously linked to Vpr ( Koziel et al . , 1998; Sukegawa et al . , 2018 ) . Relative MRC1 expression in untransduced MDM was heterogeneous , varying over a ten-fold range . When compiled across donors , MRC1 levels in mock-transduced samples were not significantly different than transduced ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013F ) . To determine whether the striking downmodulation of MR we observed with expression of both Nef and Vpr affected viral spread in MR+ macrophages , we generated additional mutations in HIV-1 89 . 6 to create a nef-null mutant and a vpr-nef-null double mutant . As expected , in transfected 293T cells these mutations did not alter Env protein levels ( Figure 4A ) or release of virions as assessed by measuring Gag p24 in the supernatant by ELISA ( Figure 4B ) . However , in primary human MDM infected with these HIVs , the mutants demonstrated defects in viral spread , with the double mutant having the greatest defect ( Figure 4C and D ) . The defect in spread was caused in part by diminished virion release , which we previously showed occurred in the absence of Vpr ( Mashiba et al . , 2014 ) ; MDM infected with the HIV mutants released less Gag p24 even after adjusting for the frequency of infected cells ( Figure 4D , right panel ) . To determine whether combined effects of Nef and Vpr on MR expression affected Env restriction , we assessed Env levels in primary human MDM infected with each construct . Because the frequency of infected cells as assessed by intracellular Gag staining ( Figure 4C ) and Gag pr55 western blot ( Figure 4E ) was lower in the mutants than in the wild-type infection , lysate from the wild-type sample was serially diluted to facilitate comparisons . Remarkably , we found that the vpr-nef-null double mutant , which retains near normal MR levels , exhibited the greatest defect in Env expression ( Figure 4E , compare lanes with similar Gag as indicated ) . In sum , Vpr and Nef-mediated downmodulation of MR correlated inversely with Env levels , consistent with MR being the previously described but unidentified HIV restriction factor that targets Env for lysosomal degradation in macrophages and is counteracted by Vpr ( Mashiba et al . , 2014 ) . Combined effects of Nef on MR and other Env binding proteins including CD4 ( Aiken et al . , 1994 ) and chemokine receptors ( Michel et al . , 2006 ) may also play a role in stabilization of Env . A particularly dense mannose-containing structure on Env , known as the mannose patch , may mediate interactions between Env and MR . This structure is present on all HIV Env proteins that require Vpr for stability in macrophages [89 . 6 , NL4-3 and AD8 ( Mashiba et al . , 2014; Collins et al . , 2015 ) . Interestingly , a macrophage tropic strain YU-2 , which was isolated from the CNS of an AIDS patient ( Li et al . , 1991 ) , lacks a mannose patch . This structure is the target of several broadly neutralizing antibodies including 2G12 , to which YU-2 is highly resistant ( Trkola et al . , 1996 ) . If Vpr targets MR to counteract detrimental interactions between MR and mannose residues on Env , we hypothesized that HIV Envs lacking a mannose patch would have a reduced requirement for Vpr . To test this hypothesis , we first examined the extent to which virion release and Env expression were influenced by Vpr in primary human MDM infected with YU-2 or 89 . 6 HIVs . Consistent with our hypothesis , we observed no significant difference in Gag p24 release between wild-type and vpr-null YU-2 infection of MDM ( Figure 5A ) . Moreover , the vpr-null mutant of YU2 displayed only a minor defect in Env expression compared to Vpr null versions of 89 . 6 and NL4-3 ( Figure 5B ) . Because there are a number of other genetic differences between YU-2 and the other HIVs , we constructed a chimeric virus , which restricted the differences to the env open reading frame . As shown in Figure 5C , a\u00a0fragment of the YU-2 genome containing most of env but none of vpr ( Figure 5C , shaded portion ) was cloned into NL4-3 and NL4-3 vpr-null . As expected , these genetic alterations did not affect Env protein levels or virion release in transfected 293T cells ( Figure 5D and E ) . To confirm that the chimeric Env was still functional , we examined infectivity in T cells prior to performing our analyses in primary human MDM . Conveniently , sequence variation within the gp120 region allows YU-2 Env to only utilize the co-receptor CCR5 for entry , whereas NL4-3 can only utilize CXCR4 . Thus , we expected the NL4 3envYU2 chimera would switch from being CXCR4- to CCR5-tropic . To test this , we utilized a T cell line expressing both chemokine receptors ( MOLT4-R5 ) and selectively blocked entry via CXCR4 and CCR5 entry inhibitors [AMD3100 and maraviroc , respectively ( Figure 5F ) ] . As expected , entry into MOLT4-R5 cells by NL4-3 was blocked by AMD3100 but not maraviroc , indicating CXCR4-tropism . The chimeric NL4-3 envYU2 and wild-type YU-2 demonstrated the inverse pattern , indicating CCR5-tropism . These results demonstrated that we had made the expected changes in the chimeric Env without disrupting its capacity to infect cells . To determine whether swapping a limited portion of YU-2 env into NL4-3 alleviated the requirement for Vpr , we examined Env expression and virion release in primary human MDM infected with these viruses . Because the parental NL4-3 virus required pseudotyping with a macrophage-tropic Env for entry and was unable to spread in MDM , all infections were treated with entry inhibitors AMD3100 and maraviroc starting at 48 hr after inoculation and maintained throughout the culture period to block subsequent rounds of infection . Consistent with our hypothesis that YU-2 Env lacked determinants necessary for the restriction that was alleviated by Vpr , we observed that wild-type NL4-3 Env but not chimeric NL4-3 envYU2 required Vpr for maximal expression ( Figure 5G ) . Moreover , MDM infected with the chimeric HIV had a reduced requirement for Vpr for maximal virion release ( Figure 5H and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This experiment provides strong evidence that the requirement for Vpr can be alleviated by genetic changes within the env open reading frame . These results are consistent with a model in which YU-2 env confers resistance to the effects of MR due to the absence of the mannose-rich structure on the YU-2 Env glycoprotein . To more directly assess the role of mannose in restricting expression of Env in HIV-1 infected primary human MDM , we engineered a version of 89 . 6 Env in which two N-linked glycosylation sites , N230 and N339 ( HIV HxB2 numbering ) were deleted by substituting non-glycosylated amino acids found at analogous positions in YU-2 Env ( Figure 6A ) . The glycosylation sites N230 and N339 were selected because they contain high-mannose glycan structures ( Leonard et al . , 1990 ) that are absent in YU-2 Env . Loss of N230 limits neutralization by glycan specific antibodies ( Huang et al . , 2014 ) . Loss of N339 decreases the amount of oligomannose ( Man9GlcNAc2 ) present on gp120 by over 25% , presumably by opening up the mannose patch to processing by \u03b1-mannosidases ( Pritchard et al . , 2015 ) . These substitutions ( N230D and N339E ) in 89 . 6 did not alter virion production ( Figure 6B ) or Env protein expression ( Figure 6C ) in transfected 293T cells . To confirm that mutation of N230 and N339 disrupted the mannose patch on Env , we assayed the ability of 2G12 , which recognizes epitopes in the mannose patch ( Sanders et al . , 2002; Scanlan et al . , 2002 ) to neutralize wild-type and mutant Env . As shown in Figure 6D , wild-type but not mannose deficient N230D N339E Env was neutralized by 2G12 . In addition , we found that these substitutions did not disrupt infection of a T cell line that does not express MR ( Figure 6E ) . However , somewhat unexpectedly , we found that HIV containing the N230D N339E Env substitutions was approximately 40% less infectious to primary human macrophages expressing MR than the wild-type parental virus ( Figure 6E , p=0 . 002 ) . This macrophage-specific difference in infectivity suggested that mannose on Env may facilitate initial infection through interactions with MR , which is highly expressed on differentiated macrophages . To examine this possibility further , we asked whether soluble mannan , which competitively inhibits MR interactions with mannose containing glycans ( Shibata et al . , 1997 ) , was inhibitory to HIV infection of macrophages . As a negative control , we tested 89 . 6 \u2206env pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein Env ( VSV-G ) which has only two N-linked glycosylation sites , both of which contain complex-type rather than high-mannose glycans ( Reading et al . , 1978 ) . Therefore VSV-G should not bind MR or be inhibited by mannan . As expected , we found that infection of a T cell line lacking MR was not sensitive to mannan ( Figure 6F , left panel ) . However , infection of MDM by wild-type HIV-1 was inhibited up to 16-fold by mannan ( Figure 6F , right panel ) . This was specific to HIV Env because mannan did not inhibit infection by HIV lacking env and pseudotyped with heterologous VSV-G Env . Interestingly , mannan also inhibited baseline macrophage infection by mannose-deficient Env ( 89 . 6 Env N230D N339E ) , indicating that N230D N339E substitutions did not completely abrogate glycans on Env that are beneficial to initial infection . In sum , our results demonstrate that interactions with mannose binding receptors are advantageous for initial HIV infection of macrophages and that the glycans remaining on Env N230D N339E retain some ability to bind glycan receptors on macrophages that facilitate infection . While interactions between high-mannose residues on Env and MR were advantageous for viral entry , we hypothesized that they interfered with intracellular Env trafficking and were deleterious to egress of Env-containing virions in the absence of Vpr and/or Nef . To test this , we examined virion release and Env expression by HIVs encoding the mannose-deficient Env N230D N339E in the presence or absence of Vpr . In a spreading infection of MDM , we found that virus expressing mannose-deficient Env had a reduced requirement for Vpr for maximal virus release compared with the parental wild-type virus ( Figure 6G , p<0 . 001 ) . In addition , in single-round infections of MDM , the mannose-deficient Env had a reduced requirement for both Nef and Vpr ( Figure 6H and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 , p<0 . 001 ) . Single round infection assays cultured for ten days were used to assess the vpr-nef double mutant because depletion of mannose on Env did not rescue spread under conditions that were most comparable to our ten day spreading infections . The defect in spread is likely due to pleiotropic effects of Nef that disrupt interference by the HIV receptors , CD4 , CXCR4 and CCR5 ( Lama et al . , 1999; Michel et al . , 2005; Venzke et al . , 2006 ) combined with the reduced infectivity of the mannose deficient Env . Finally , we asked whether the mannose-deficient Env had increased stability in primary human MDM lacking Vpr and/or Nef by western blot analysis . We found that the Env mutant ( N230D . N339E ) was more stable in the absence of Vpr ( Figure 6I , right side , black bars ) and Nef ( Figure 6I , right side , gray bars ) once differences in infection frequency were accounted for by matching pr55 expression in the dilution series . These data provide strong support for a model in which MR restricts Env expression via direct interaction with high-mannose residues on Env and this restriction is counteracted by Vpr and Nef . To directly test the hypothesis that MR is a restriction factor in MDM that is counteracted by Vpr , we examined the effect of MR silencing on Env expression in HIV-infected MDM lacking Vpr . Consistent with our hypothesis , we observed that silencing MR stabilized Env relative to Gag pr55 ( Figure 7A ) . These results support the conclusion that the Env restriction observed in the absence of Vpr is dependent on expression of MR . Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that restriction of Env in primary human MDM disrupted formation of virological synapses and cell-to-cell spread of HIV from infected MDM to T cells ( Collins et al . , 2015 ) . Expression of Vpr alleviated these effects , dramatically increasing viral transmission \u2013 especially under conditions of low initial inoculum of free virus . To expand on these findings , we measured Vpr-dependent HIV-1 spread from primary human MDM to autologous T cells , as diagrammed in Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A . Co-cultured cells were stained for CD3 to distinguish T cells and CD14 to distinguish MDM as shown in Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B , accounting for differences in autofluorescent background in the two cell types by using isotype controls ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C ) We confirmed our prior finding that Vpr enhances HIV-1 89 . 6 spread from MDM to T cells ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D ) and extended this finding to the transmitted/founder ( T/F ) clone REJO ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . Consistent with our previous findings , we observed that a higher frequency of T cells became infected following co-culture with infected MDM as compared to incubation with high titer cell free virus [47-fold ( 89 . 6 , p=0 . 0002 ) and 38-fold ( REJO , p=0 . 048 ) ] . To determine whether Vpr stimulated spread from macrophages to T cells by counteracting MR restriction , we measured spread to T cells from macrophages in which MR had been silenced as diagrammed in Figure 7B . Using the gating strategy shown in Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B , infected MDM and infected T cells were identified by intracellular Gag stain ( Figure 7C ) . We found that silencing MR reduced the difference between wild type and Vpr-null infected macrophage spread to T cells from 7-fold ( p=0 . 003 ) to 2-fold ( p=0 . 02 ) ( Figure 7D ) . These results provide strong evidence that MR is the previously described but unidentified restriction factor in macrophages that reduces HIV spread from macrophages to T lymphocytes in the absence of Vpr . \n We previously reported that Env and Env-containing virions are degraded in macrophage lysosomes in the absence of Vpr , impairing virion release , virological synapse formation , and spread of HIV to T cells ( Mashiba et al . , 2014; Collins et al . , 2015 ) . Moreover , this requirement for Vpr was conferred to heterokaryons comprised of macrophages and permissive cells , suggesting the existence of a previously unidentified host restriction factor that is counteracted by Vpr in macrophages ( Mashiba et al . , 2014 ) . Results presented here clearly define mannose receptor ( MR ) as the HIV restriction factor counteracted by Vpr in macrophages to enhance viral dissemination . We provide strong evidence that Env mannosylation is required for restriction of Env and virion release in macrophages in the absence of Vpr , and that MR silencing relieves a requirement for Vpr to overcome this restriction . Moreover , we confirm and extend a prior report that Nef also acts to downmodulate MR from the macrophage cell surface ( Vigerust et al . , 2005 ) and demonstrate that Vpr and Nef cooperate to counteract MR in an additive fashion through independent mechanisms . Other investigators have reported that HIV inhibits MRC1 transcription in macrophages and that MR inhibits virion egress upon exogenous expression in 293T cells ( Sukegawa et al . , 2018 ) . In contrast to results we report here , the prior study observed effects on virions that were Env-independent and did not examine effects of Vpr on MR . In primary macrophages , Vpr-sensitive virion restriction only occurs when virions contain Env ( Mashiba et al . , 2014 ) and genetic changes in the env open reading frame \u2013 especially those that alter N-linked glycosylation sites \u2013 critically affect the requirement for Vpr . The effect of MR on Env and Env-containing virion release reported here helps explain previous observations that primate lentivirus infection reduces MR activity in humans ( Koziel et al . , 1993; Koziel et al . , 1998 ) and monkeys ( Holder et al . , 2014 ) . By confirming and extending our prior finding that Vpr-mediated stabilization of Env promotes macrophage to T cell spread ( Collins et al . , 2015 ) we also provide an explanation for how Vpr increases infection of human lymphoid tissue ex vivo ( Eckstein et al . , 2001; Rucker et al . , 2004 ) , which contain macrophages and T cells in a highly physiological , three-dimensional environment . As Nef had already been shown to reduce MR surface expression ( Vigerust et al . , 2005 ) , the observation that HIV encodes a second protein , Vpr , to reduce MR expression was unanticipated , but not unprecedented; other host proteins are known to be affected by more than one lentiviral accessory protein . The HIV receptor , CD4 , is simultaneously targeted by Vpu , Nef and Env in HIV-1 ( Chen et al . , 1996 ) and tetherin is alternately targeted by Vpu , Nef , or Env in different strains of primate lentiviruses ( Harris et al . , 2012 ) . Nef has also been shown to downmodulate the viral co-receptors CXCR4 ( Venzke et al . , 2006 ) and CCR5 ( Michel et al . , 2005 ) , which may also interfere with Env expression and viral egress in infected cells . Nef\u2019s activity against CXCR4 , CCR5 , and MR presumably has the same ultimate purpose as its activity against CD4 , namely to stabilize Env , enhance virion release and prevent superinfection of the producer cell ( Lama et al . , 1999; Ross et al . , 1999 ) . The impact of these deleterious interactions is clearly demonstrated by the profound loss of Env we observed in HIV-infected macrophages lacking both Vpr and Nef . The need for both Vpr and Nef to counteract MR may be explained by the high level of MR expression , estimated at 100 , 000 copies per macrophage ( Stahl et al . , 1980 ) . The potent combined effect likely derives from synergistic targeting of MR at two different stages of MR synthesis . Nef was shown to alter MR trafficking ( Vigerust et al . , 2005 ) and we show Vpr inhibits MR transcription . In addition , our results suggest that maximal MR downmodulation is time-dependent in macrophages , which have the capacity to survive while infected for weeks; western blot analysis of whole cell lysates from saturated , ten-day infected cultures achieved a more striking reduction than was observed by flow cytometric analysis of five day cultures of macrophages infected with non-spreading viruses expressing GFP . This time dependency is potentially explainable in part by the\u00a0very long half-life of MR [33 hr ( Lennartz et al . , 1989 ) ] combined with the large amount of MR expressed per cell discussed above . In sharp contrast to the effect we observed in MDM , Vpr did not affect MR protein levels when MR was expressed via a heterologous promoter in the 293T cell line , which is derived from human embryonic kidney cells and is not a natural target of HIV . The cell type selectivity in these experiments is likely due to differences in the promoters driving MR expression , however , we cannot rule out the existence of other macrophage specific pathways required to recreate the effect of Vpr on MR . Further work will be needed to examine these questions and determine other mechanistic details . Our findings also implicate the Vpr binding protein VprBP/DCAF1 ( McCall et al . , 2008 ) , a component of the cellular DCAF1-DDB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex , in downmodulation of MR by Vpr . This complex is required for most of the known functions of Vpr , including: disruption of the cell cycle , disruption of cellular DNA repair pathways in dividing cells ( Belzile et al . , 2007; Hrecka et al . , 2007; Le Rouzic et al . , 2007; Wen et al . , 2007; Lahouassa et al . , 2016; Wu et al . , 2016; Zhou et al . , 2016 ) and transcriptional inhibition of type I interferons in response to infection in macrophage cultures ( Laguette et al . , 2014; Mashiba et al . , 2014 ) . Additional research is now needed to determine how interactions between Vpr and DCAF1 mediate these pleiotropic effects . Deleterious interactions between MR and Env that are alleviated by Vpr and Nef , likely occur along the secretory pathway and continue at the cell surface . This is based on previously published work showing that Env-containing virions are retained at the cell surface and targeted to lysosomes in macrophages lacking Vpr ( Collins et al . , 2015 ) . Our prior studies also provided evidence that unprocessed Env gp160 is affected and targeted to lysosomal compartments albeit to a lesser degree ( Mashiba et al . , 2014 ) . Because Env processing occurs via furin-mediated cleavage in the trans-Golgi network ( TGN ) , the effect on unprocessed Env provides evidence that in addition to acting at the surface , MR likely also interacts with Env along the secretory pathway prior to its arrival and processing in the TGN . MR\u2019s interaction with Env appears to be mediated by the unusually high density of N linked glycosylation sites on Env that retain high-mannose glycans , which is a known pathogen-associated molecular pattern ( Stahl and Ezekowitz , 1998; McGreal et al . , 2006 ) . Here , we show that selective deletion of mannose residues alleviated the requirement for Vpr . Deletion of individual glycosylation sites is known to lead to changes in the processing of neighboring glycans and deletions at certain sites lead to larger than expected losses of oligomannose ( Balzarini , 2007 ) presumably because their removal allows greater access to mannosidases and facilitates trimming of surrounding glycans . Selective pressure to maintain mannose residues on Env may be due to the enhanced attachment they mediate . Indeed , we provide strong evidence that Env\u2019s interaction with MR boosts initial infection of MDM . This finding is supported by a prior report that MR enhances HIV-1 binding to macrophages and transmission of the bound virus to co-cultured T cells ( Nguyen and Hildreth , 2003 ) . Our study adds to these findings by providing evidence that interactions with mannose binding receptors also enhance direct infection of macrophages . Moreover , the capacity of Vpr and Nef to mitigate the effect of detrimental intracellular interactions during viral egress limits the negative impact of retaining high-mannose on Env . In addition , the dense glycan packing , which is privileged from antibody recognition through immune tolerance , is believed to play a role in evasion of the antibody response ( Stewart-Jones et al . , 2016 ) . Because MR has both positive and negative effects on infection , the interpretation of some experiments examining spreading infection in the setting of MR silencing or mutations in Env that reduced mannose content were complex to interpret . Some donors had increased infection resulting from MR silencing whereas others had a small decrease at the ten-day time point ( data not shown ) . By using viral systems that allowed us to focus independently on viral entry and exit , we nevertheless clearly discerned that MR can serve as a positive factor for entry and a negative factor for egress . Thus far , all viral Envs we have tested ( NL4-3 , AD8 and 89 . 6 ) require Vpr for stable expression in macrophages except YU-2 . We show here that genetically altering the mannose patch on 89 . 6 so that it mirrored changes in the YU-2 mannose patch altered the behavior of 89 . 6 to resemble that of YU-2 with respect to Vpr phenotypes . This is strong evidence supporting our model that Vpr alleviates deleterious interactions caused by the Env mannose patch . Interestingly , YU-2 was cloned from the central nervous system and 89 . 6 was directly cloned from peripheral blood . Because the blood-brain barrier limits exposure to antibodies , CNS isolates may have a diminished requirement for high mannose residues , which protect from antibody responses . Here we also confirm and extend our prior observation ( Collins et al . , 2015 ) that co-culturing T cells with infected MDM boosted HIV infection compared to direct infection of T cells with cell-free virus . Similar to clone 89 . 6 , T cell infection by the transmitter/founder virus REJO was enhanced by co-culture with MDM , and spread from MDM to T cells was enhanced by Vpr . In the context of natural person-to-person transmission , accelerated spread to T cells may be critical to establishing a persistent infection before innate and adaptive immune responses are activated . The strong selective pressure to retain Vpr despite its limited effect on T cell-only cultures indicates there is more to learn about the role of Vpr , macrophages and T/F viruses in HIV transmission and pathogenesis . Collectively , these studies suggest that novel therapeutic approaches to inhibit the activity of Vpr and Nef in macrophages would potentially represent a new class of antiretroviral drug that could be an important part of a treatment or prophylactic cocktail . \n The following molecular clones were obtained via the AIDS Reagent Program: p89 . 6 [cat# 3552 from Dr . Ronald G . Collman ) , pNL4-3 ( cat# 114 from Dr . Malcolm Martin ) , pREJO . c/2864 ( cat# 11746 from Dr . John Kappes and Dr . Christina Ochsenbauer ) and pYU2 ( cat# 1350 from Dr . Beatrice Hahn and Dr . George Shaw ) . Vpr-null versions of 89 . 6 , NL4-3 , and YU2 were created by cutting the AflII site within vpr and filling in with Klenow fragment . The vpr-null version of REJO was created by doing the same at the AvrII site . A nef-null version of 89 . 6 was created by deleting nef from its start codon to the XhoI site . To do this , a PCR amplicon was generated from the XhoI site in env to env\u2019s stop codon . The 3\u2019 reverse primer added a XhoI site after the stop codon . The 89 . 6 genome and the amplicon were digested with XhoI and ligated together . ( 5\u2019 primer CACCATTATCGTTTCAGACCCT and 3\u2019 primer TCTCGAGTTTAAACTTATAGCAAAGCCCTTTCCA ) . The NL4-3 envYU2 chimera consists of the pNL4-3 plasmid in which the fragment from the KpnI site in env to the BamHI site in env has been replaced with the equivalent fragment of pYU-2 . Because the KpnI site is not unique within the plasmid , the fragment from the SalI site to BamHI site ( which are unique ) was cloned into pUC19 , the change was made in env , and the fragment from SalI to BamHI was inserted back into pNL4-3 . To generate p89 . 6 N230D N339E a synthetic DNA sequence ( ThermoFisher , Waltham , Massachusetts ) was purchased commercially . The synthetic gene contained the following nucleotide mutations , counting from the start of 89 . 6 env: 694 A\u00a0>\u00a0G , 701 C\u00a0>\u00a0A , 1018 A\u00a0>\u00a0G , 1020 T\u00a0>\u00a0A . This sequence was substituted into p89 . 6 using the KpnI and BsaBI sites within env . pSIV3+ , pSPAX2 , pAPM-1221 and pMD2 . G were obtained from Dr . Jeremy Luban ( Pertel et al . , 2011 ) . pSIV3+ vpr-null was generated using a synthesized DNA sequence ( ThermoFisher ) containing a fragment of the SIV genome in which the Vpr start codon was converted to a stop codon ( TAG ) . This was substituted into pSIV3+ using the sites BstBI and SapI . pYU2 env was obtained from Dr . Joseph Sodroski ( Sullivan et al . , 1995 ) . Creation of pNL4-3 \u2206GPE-GFP was described previously ( Zhang et al . , 2004; McNamara et al . , 2012 ) . Notably , the transcript containing the gfp gene retains the first 42 amino acids of env , including the signal peptide , which creates a fully fluorescent Env-GFP fusion protein . The vpr-Q65R mutant of NL4-3 \u2206GPE-GFP was created using the Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit from New England Biolabs ( Ipswich , MA ) . The forward primer was AGAATTCTGCGACAACTGCTG and the reverse primer TATTATGGCTTCCACTCC . After synthesis by PCR , the entire provirus was confirmed by sequencing . pCDNA . 3 . hMR was obtained from Dr . Johnny J . He ( Liu et al . , 2004 ) . pPROA-3FLAG-UNG2-EYFP was obtained from Dr . Marit Otterlei ( Akbari et al . , 2010 ) and 3x FLAG tagged UNG2 was amplified using the 5\u2019 primer CTAGCTCGAGACCATGGACTACAAAGACCATGAC , which added an XhoI site , and the 3\u2019 primer GTTAACTCACAGCTCCTTCCAGTCAATGGGCTT , which added an HpaI site . The amplicon was cloned into the XhoI and HpaI sites of pMSCV IRES-GFP ( Van Parijs et al . , 1999 ) to generate pMSCV 3xFLAG UNG2 IRES-GFP . Leukocytes isolated from anonymous donors by apheresis were obtained from the New York Blood Center Component Laboratory . The use of human blood from anonymous , de-identified donors was classified as non-human subject research in accordance with federal regulations and thus not subjected to formal IRB review . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were purified by Ficoll density gradient . CD14+ monocytes were positively selected using a CD14 sorting kit ( cat# 17858 , StemCell Technologies , Vancouver , Canada ) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . Monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ) were obtained by culturing monocytes in R10 [RPMI-1640 with 10% certified endotoxin-low fetal bovine serum ( Invitrogen , ThermoFisher ) , penicillin ( 100 Units/mL ) , streptomycin ( 100 \u03bcg/mL ) , L-glutamine ( 292 \u03bcg/mL ) , carrier-free M-CSF ( 50 ng/mL , R and D Systems , Minneapolis , Minnesota ) and GM-CSF ( 50 ng/mL , R and D Systems ) ] for seven days . Monocytes were plated at 5 \u00d7 105 cells/well in a 24 well dish , except for those to be transduced with lentivirus and puromycin selected , which were plated at 1 \u00d7 106 cells/well . CD4+ T lymphocytes were prepared from donor PBMCs as follows: anti-CD8 Dynabeads ( cat# 11147D , ThermoFisher ) were used to deplete CD8+ T lymphocytes and the remaining cells , which were mainly CD4+ lymphocytes , were maintained in R10 until the time of stimulation . Lymphocytes were stimulated with 5 \u03bcg/mL phytohemagglutinin ( PHA-L , Calbiochem , Millipore Sigma , Burlington , Massachusetts ) overnight before addition of 50 IU/mL recombinant human IL-2 ( R and D Systems ) . The 293T cell line was obtained from ATCC and independently authenticated by STR profiling . It was maintained in DMEM medium ( Gibco ) supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin , 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin , 2 mM glutamine ( Pen-Strep-Glutamine , Invitrogen ) , 10% fetal bovine serum ( Invitrogen ) , and 0 . 022% plasmocin ( Invivogen ) . The MOLT-R5 cell line was obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Repository , which confirmed the lot is mycoplasma negative . It was maintained in RPMI-1640 medium ( Gibco ) supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin , 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin , 2 mM glutamine ( Pen-Strep-Glutamine , Invitrogen ) , 10% fetal bovine serum ( Invitrogen ) , and 0 . 022% plasmocin ( Invivogen ) . Sequences within MRC1 suitable for shRNA-based targeting were identified using the program available at http://katahdin . mssm . edu/siRNA/RNAi . cgi ? type=shRNA maintained by the laboratory of Dr . Ravi Sachidanandam . The sequence chosen , 5\u2019-AGTAACTTGACTGATAATCAAT-3\u2019 was synthesized as part of larger DNA oligonucleotides with the sequences TCGAGAAGGTATATTGCTGTTGACAGTGAGCGAGTAACTTGACTGATAATCAATTAGTGAAGCCACAGATGTAATTGATTATCAGTCAAGTTACTTGCCTACTGCCTCGG ( forward ) and AATTCCGAGGCAGTAGGCAAGTAACTTGACTGATAATCAATTACATCTGTGGCTTCACTAATTGATTATCAGTCAAGTTACTCGCTCACTGTCAACAGCAATATACCTTC ( reverse ) . These oligos were annealed , which created overhangs identical to those produced by digestion with the enzymes EcoRI and XhoI . This double stranded DNA oligomer was inserted into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pAPM-1221 to generate pAPM-MRC1-C . Short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing was performed as previously described ( Pertel et al . , 2011; Mashiba and Collins , 2013; Collins et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , we spinoculated freshly isolated primary monocytes with VSV-G-pseudotyped SIV3+ vpr-null at 2500 rpm for 2 hr with 4 \u03bcg/mL polybrene to allow Vpx-dependent degradation of SAMHD1 . Cells were then incubated overnight in R10 with M-CSF ( 50 ng/mL ) and GM-CSF ( 50 ng/mL ) plus VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus containing an shRNA cassette targeting luciferase ( pAPM-1221 or \u2018shNC\u2019 ) or MR ( pAPM-MRC1-C or \u2018shMR\u2019 ) . The following day , media was removed and replaced with fresh R10 with M-CSF ( 50 ng/mL ) and GM-CSF ( 50 ng/mL ) . Three days later 10 \u03bcg/mL puromycin was added and cells were cultured for three additional days prior to HIV-1 infection . shRNA target sequences used: Luciferase: 5'-TACAAACGCTCTCATCGACAAG-3' , MRC1: 5\u2019-ATTGATTATCAGTCAAGTTACT-3\u2019 . Virus stocks were obtained by transfecting 293T cells ( ATCC , Manassas , Virginia ) with viral DNA and polyethylenimine ( PEI ) . Cells were plated at 2 . 5 \u00d7 106 cells per 10 cm dish and incubated overnight . The following day 12 \u00b5g of total DNA was combined with 48 \u00b5g of PEI , mixed by vortexing , and added to each plate of cells . For NL4-3 \u2206GPE-GFP , cells were transfected with 4 \u00b5g viral genome , 4 \u00b5g pCMV-HIV , and 4 \u00b5g pHCMV-V ( VSV-G expression plasmid ) . For SIV3+ vpr-null the cells were transfected with 10 . 5 \u00b5g of viral genome and 1 . 5 \u00b5g pHCMV-V . For shLentivirus ( shNC or shMR ) cells were transfected with 6 \u00b5g pAPM-1221 or pAPM-MRC1-C , 4 . 5 \u00b5g pSPAX2 , and 1 . 5 \u00b5g pMD2 . G . Viral supernatant was collected 48 hr post-transfection and centrifuged at 1500 rpm ( 500\u00a0x\u00a0g ) 5 min to remove cellular debris . SIV3+ vpr-null was pelleted by centrifugation at 14 , 000 rpm ( 23 , 700\u00a0x\u00a0g ) for 4 hr at 4\u00b0C and resuspended at 10x concentration . Virus stocks were aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C . Co-transfections of HIV and MR or UNG2 were performed in 293T cells . Cells were plated at 1 . 6 \u00d7 105 per well in a 12-well dish . The following day 10 ng of pcDNA . 3 . hMR or 10 ng of pMSCV 3xFLAG UNG2 IRES-GFP , 250 ng of NL4-3 \u2206GPE-GFP , and 740 ng pUC19 plasmid was combined with 4 \u00b5g PEI , mixed by vortexing , and added to each well . 48 hr later , cells were lifted using enzyme free cell dissociation buffer ( ThermoFisher , cat# 13150016 ) and analyzed by flow cytometry or lysed in 500 \u00b5L blue loading buffer ( cat# 7722 , Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , Massachusetts ) and analyzed by western blot . Prior to infection , 500 \u00b5L of medium was removed from each well and this \u2018conditioned\u2019 medium was saved to be replaced after the infection . MDM were infected by equal inocula of HIV as measured by Gag p24 mass in 500 \u00b5L of R10 for 6 hr at 37\u00b0C . After 6 hr , infection medium was removed and replaced with a 1:2 mixture of conditioned medium and fresh R10 . Where indicated , HIV spread was blocked by AMD3100 ( 10 \u00b5g/mL , AIDS Reagent Program cat# 8128 ) and/or maraviroc ( 20 \u00b5M , AIDS Reagent Program cat# 11580 ) added 48 hr post-infection and replenished with each media change every three days . MDM were centrifuged at 2500 rpm ( 1049\u00a0x\u00a0g ) for 2 hr at 25\u00b0C with equal volume of NL4-3 \u2206GPE-GFP or an isogenic mutant in 500 uL total medium . Following infection , medium was removed and replaced with a 1:2 mixture of conditioned medium and fresh R10 . Adenovirus was prepared by the University of Michigan Vector Core , and the transduction of MDM was performed as previously described ( Leonard et al . , 2011 ) at an MOI of 1000 based on 293T cell infection estimations and the concentration of particles as assessed by OD280 . Activated T cells were infected by two methods as indicated . For direct infection , 5 \u00d7 105 cells were plated per well with 50 \u00b5g HIV p24 in 500 \u00b5L R10 +50IU/mL of IL-2 and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 hr . For co-culture with autologous , infected MDM medium was removed from MDM wells and 5 \u00d7 105 T cells were added in 1mL R10 + 50IU/mL of IL-2 . All T cell infections were collected 48 hr post infection . Intracellular staining of cells using antibodies directed against HIV Gag p24 , MR and FLAG-UNG2 was performed by permeabilizing paraformaldehyde-fixed cells with 0 . 1% Triton-X in PBS for 5 min , followed by incubation with antibody for 20 min at room temperature . For Gag and MR , PE-conjugated primary antibodies were used . For FLAG-UNG2 , cells were stained with a PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 secondary antibody for 20 min at room temperature . Surface staining for CD4 , CD3 and CD14 was performed before fixation as described previously ( Collins et al . , 2015 ) . Flow cytometric data was acquired using a FACSCanto instrument with FACSDiva collection software ( BD , Franklin Lakes , New Jersey ) or a FACScan ( Cytek , BD ) with FlowJo software ( TreeStar , Ashland , Oregon ) and analyzed using FlowJo software . Live NL4-3 \u2206GPE-GFP transduced cells were sorted using a FACSAria III ( BD ) or MoFlo Astrios ( Beckman Coulter ) and gating on GFP+ cells . MDM sorted as described above in \u2018Flow cytometry\u2019 were collected into tubes containing RLT buffer ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) and RNA was isolated using RNeasy Kit ( Qiagen ) with on-column DNase I digestion . RNA was reverse transcribed using qScript cDNA SuperMix ( Cat #95048 , Quantabio , Beverly , Massachusetts ) . Quantitative PCR was performed using TaqMan Gene Expression MasterMix ( ThermoFisher , cat# 4369016 ) on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System using TaqMan Gene Expression primers with FAM-MGB probe . The primer/probe sets for ACTB ( Hs99999903 ) , MRC1 ( Hs00267207 ) , POL2A ( Hs02786624 ) , and GAPDH ( Hs00172187 ) were purchased from ThermoFisher . Reactions were quantified using ABI Sequence Detection software compared to serial dilutions of cDNA from mock-treated cells . Measured values for all genes were normalized to measured values of GAPDH or ACTB as indicated . MDM cultures were lysed in Blue Loading Buffer ( cat# 7722 , Cell Signaling Technology ) , sonicated with a Misonix sonicator ( Qsonica , LLC . , Newtown , Connecticut ) , boiled for 5 min at 95\u00b0C and clarified by centrifugation at 8000 RPM ( 7 , 000\u00a0x\u00a0g ) for 3 min . Lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE immunoblot . The proteins MR , GAPDH and pr55 were visualized using AlexFluor-647 conjugated secondary antibodies on a Typhoon FLA 9500 scanner ( GE , Boston , Massachusetts ) and quantified using ImageQL ( GE ) . The proteins gp160 , gp120 , gp41 , Nef , Vpr , GFP , Env-GFP , STING , GBP5 , and IFITM3 were visualized using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies on film . Immunoblot films were scanned and the mean intensity of each band , minus the background , was calculated using the histogram function of Photoshop CC ( Adobe , San Jose , California ) . Supernatant containing viral particles was lysed in Triton X lysis buffer ( 0 . 05% Tween 20 , 0 . 5% Triton X-100 , 0 . 5% casein in PBS ) . Gag p24 antibody ( clone 183-H12-5C , AIDS Reagent Program cat# 1519 from Dr . Bruce Cheseboro and Dr . Hardy Chen ) was bound to Nunc MaxiSorp plates ( ThermoFisher cat# 12-565-135 ) at 4\u00b0C overnight . Lysed samples were captured for 2 hr and then incubated with biotinylated antibody to Gag p24 ( clone 31-90-25 , ATCC cat# HB-9725 ) for 1 hr . Clone 31-90-25 was biotinylated with the EZ-Link Micro Sulfo-NHS-Biotinylation Kit ( ThermoFisher cat# PI-21925 ) . Clones 31-90-25 and 182-H12-5C were purified using Protein G columns ( GE Healthcare , cat# 45-000-054 ) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . Samples were detected using streptavidin-HRP ( Fitzgerald , Acton , Massachusetts ) and 3 , 3\u2032 , 5 , 5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine substrate ( Sigma cat# T8665-IL ) .

These cells can either divide to produce more progenitor cells or develop into specific types of neurons . These two activities \u2013 known as self-renewal and differentiation \u2013 must be balanced to produce the right number of specialized neurons , without depleting the pool of progenitor cells . The self-renewal and differentiation of progenitor cells is balanced by essentially regulating which genes are active , or expressed , within the cells . In the first step of gene expression , the genetic instructions are copied to form a molecule of pre-messenger RNA ( or pre-mRNA for short ) . Each pre-mRNA molecule is then processed to produce a final product that can be translated into protein . Importantly , two copies of the same pre-mRNA may sometimes be processed in different ways , which allows multiple proteins to be produced from a single gene . RNA-binding proteins control pre-mRNA processing . The expression of one such protein , called Sam68 , oscillates during the development of the nervous system , such that its expression peaks when there is intense production of new neurons and then declines . However , it was not known whether Sam68 actually helps neurons to develop . La Rosa et al . have now analysed the role of Sam68 in the developing brain of mice . The experiments confirmed that Sam68 is highly expressed in neural progenitor cells and showed that its levels dictate the cell\u2019s fate: high expression encourages a cell to self-renew , while low expression triggers it to develop into a specialized neuron . Further investigation revealed that Sam68 works by promoting the expression of a metabolic enzyme called Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1A3 or ALDH1A3 . This enzyme promotes the release of energy from molecules of glucose via a process known as anaerobic glycolysis . La Rosa et al . found that cells that lack Sam68 make a truncated version of the pre-mRNA encoding ALDH1A3 . This truncated pre-mRNA encodes a shortened version of the enzyme that is inactive . Further experiments confirmed that Sam68 normally prevents this from happening by binding to the pre-mRNA and processing it to produce the full-length , working version of the ALDH1A3 enzyme . Also , La Rosa et al . found that progenitor cells need working ALDH1A3 to keep them dividing , and to stop them from developing into specialized neurons too soon . Finally , because the processing of pre-RNA plays a major role in brain development , problems with this process often lead to intellectual disabilities and neurodegenerative diseases , such as autism spectrum disorder and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . The next step following on from these new findings will be to investigate whether defects in Sam68 contribute to such conditions and , if so , to look for ways to counteract these defects .", "source": "The balance between self-renewal and differentiation of neural progenitor cells ( NPCs ) dictates neurogenesis and proper brain development . We found that the RNA- binding protein Sam68 ( Khdrbs1 ) is strongly expressed in neurogenic areas of the neocortex and supports the self-renewing potential of mouse NPCs . Knockout of Khdrbs1 constricted the pool of proliferating NPCs by accelerating their cell cycle exit and differentiation into post-mitotic neurons . Sam68 function was linked to regulation of Aldh1a3 pre-mRNA 3'-end processing . Binding of Sam68 to an intronic polyadenylation site prevents its recognition and premature transcript termination , favoring expression of a functional enzyme . The lower ALDH1A3 expression and activity in Khdrbs1-/- NPCs results in reduced glycolysis and clonogenicity , thus depleting the embryonic NPC pool and limiting cortical expansion . Our study identifies Sam68 as a key regulator of NPC self-renewal and establishes a novel link between modulation of ALDH1A3 expression and maintenance of high glycolytic metabolism in the developing cortex . \n Neurogenesis is the process that leads to a regionalized brain from an embryonic neuroepithelium . In the mouse developing brain , most neurons are generated between the 10th day of embryonal life ( E10 ) and birth ( Martynoga et al . , 2012 ) , even though adult neurogenesis persists in restricted areas near the lateral ventricles , the ventricular ( VZ ) and subventricular ( SVZ ) zones ( Bjornsson et al . , 2015 ) , and in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus ( Urb\u00e1n and Guillemot , 2014 ) . Neurogenesis is fueled by specialized stem cells that are collectively named Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells ( NPCs ) ( Johansson et al . , 2010; Taverna et al . , 2014 ) . As embryonic neurogenesis starts , neuroepithelial cells at first , and radial glia cells ( RGCs ) later , divide symmetrically in the VZ , to generate cells retaining self-renewal capacity , or asymetrically to give rise to intermediate progenitor cells ( IPCs ) or differentiated cells ( Paridaen and Huttner , 2014; Taverna et al . , 2014 ) . IPCs divide away from the VZ , one or more times , before they generate post-mitotic neurons , which localize in the basal compartment of the developing cortex ( cortical layer ) . These divisions of neural precursors need to be tightly modulated , as proper regulation of neurogenesis is of paramount importance to achieve the right number of neurons and the correct expansion and stratification of the cortex during development . In particular , fine-tuned control of NPC fate is required to balance self-renewing divisions with asymmetric divisions ( Taverna et al . , 2014; Fern\u00e1ndez et al . , 2016 ) . Conversely , dysregulation of neurogenesis can result in developmental disorders linked to neurological pathologies ( Sun and Hevner , 2014 ) . Thus , understanding the molecular mechanisms that control neurogenesis may pave the path to novel approaches to these diseases . Multiple mechanisms , including regulation of metabolic routes ( Shyh-Chang et al . , 2013 ) and of gene expression ( Paridaen and Huttner , 2014 ) , cooperate to create an interconnected network that balances NPC self-renewal and differentiation in the correct time and space during cortical expansion . Mounting evidence documents that modulation of RNA metabolism , and particularly of alternative splicing , plays a key role in neurogenesis and during formation of neuronal circuits , as highlighted by the global changes in the splicing signature that accompany the transition from NPCs to neurons ( Zheng and Black , 2013; Raj and Blencowe , 2015 ) . Splicing is operated by the spliceosome , a large ribonucleoprotein machinery that mediates sequentially ordered reactions to excise introns and ligate exons ( Wahl et al . , 2009 ) . Through regulated assortment of multiple exons and introns during pre-mRNA processing , alternative splicing allows the production of many splice variants from most genes , thus greatly amplifying the coding potential and plasticity of the genome ( Fu\u00a0and\u00a0Ares , 2014 ) . Notably , brain is among the tissues displaying the largest extent of alternative splicing , which likely contributes to the complexity of neural circuits ( Raj and Blencowe , 2015 ) . In support of this notion , several splicing factors have been shown to play key roles during neurogenesis and/or specific brain functions ( Raj and Blencowe , 2015 ) . For instance , a temporal switch in the expression of two homologous polypyrimidine-tract-binding proteins , PTBP1 and PTBP2 , governs splicing of a large set of neural-specific exons in genes involved in neuronal functions ( Boutz et al . , 2007 ) . Knockout of the Ptbp2 gene caused premature neurogenesis and depletion of the NPC pool ( Licatalosi et al . , 2012 ) , proving the crucial role played by this splicing factor in the developing brain . Similarly , the neural-specific serine-arginine ( SR ) -related protein of 100 kDa ( nSR100 ) regulates a network of exons in genes involved in neuronal functions and knockout of this gene in mice leads to widespread neurodevelopmental defects ( Calarco et al . , 2009; Quesnel-Valli\u00e8res et al . , 2015 ) . Another splicing factor involved in neuronal functions is Sam68 , encoded by the Khdrbs1 gene , which is highly expressed in brain and testis ( Richard et al . , 2005; Paronetto et al . , 2009 ) , and it was shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome ( Sellier et al . , 2010 ) and spinal muscular atrophy ( Pedrotti et al . , 2010; Pagliarini et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , Sam68 modulates splicing of the neurexin one gene ( Nrxn1 ) in response to neuronal activity ( Iijima et al . , 2011 ) and its ablation caused altered synaptic plasticity and motor coordination defects ( Lukong and Richard , 2008; Iijima et al . , 2011 ) . In this study , we have investigated the role of Sam68 during the development of the central nervous system . Sam68 is strongly expressed during cortical expansion ( E10 . 5\u201315 . 5 ) , whereas its levels decline after birth . We found that Sam68 regulates the switch between self-renewal and differentiation of mouse NPCs both in vivo and in vitro . Splicing-sensitive microarrays identified a subset of genes and exons whose expression is dependent on Sam68 in NPCs . In particular , Sam68 prevents usage of a cryptic polyadenylation signal ( PAS ) in intron 7 of the Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1A3 ( Aldh1a3 ) gene , thus promoting the expression of a functional enzyme . We also found that ALDH1A3 enhances anaerobic glycolytic metabolism in NPCs and that enforcing its activity rescued the self-renewal defect of Sam68 knockout ( Khdrbs1-/- ) NPCs . Conversely , Aldh1a3 knockdown in wild-type cells mimicked the phenotype of Sam68 knockout NPCs , by reducing glycolytic activity and promoting neuronal differentiation . Thus , our work unveils a key role of Sam68 in neurogenesis through regulation of Aldh1a3 pre-mRNA processing , which results in the modulation of glycolytic metabolism and NPC fate during cortical development . \n Sam68 is a KH-domain RNA-binding protein involved in several steps of RNA metabolism ( Bielli et al . , 2011; Frisone et al . , 2015 ) . Developmental analysis of the mouse cortex showed that Sam68 mRNA and protein levels peak between E13 . 5 and E15 . 5 , whereas its expression slowly declines thereafter and is minimal from 9 days post-partum ( 9dpp ) until adulthood ( Figure 1A , B ) . The peak of Sam68 expression corresponds to stages of intense neurogenesis in the developing cortex ( Paridaen and Huttner , 2014; Taverna et al . , 2014 ) and parallels that of the NPC marker SOX2 , which is also high between E10 . 5 and E15 . 5 and sharply decreases in post-natal stages ( Figure 1B ) . Furthermore , Sam68 is strongly expressed in neurogenic periventricular regions of E13 . 5 brain , like SOX2 ( Figure 1C ) . Sam68 and SOX2 co-localized in most cells of the VZ and SVZ of E13 . 5 cortex ( Figure 1D ) , and their expression was even more restricted to these cortical zones at 1dpp ( Figure 1E ) . These results suggested that Sam68 expression is high in NPCs and declines upon differentiation . To test this hypothesis , NPCs were isolated from E13 . 5 cortex and cultured in vitro under proliferating or differentiating conditions ( Bertram et al . , 2012 ) . Sam68 , like SOX2 , was abundant in proliferating NPC ( 0d ) and steadily decreased when cells were induced to differentiate ( 1d-6d in Figure 1F , G ) . Conversely , expression of the neuronal marker TUBB3 ( \u03b2III-tubulin ) was barely detectable in proliferating NPCs and augmented upon differentiation ( Figure 1F , G ) . Thus , Sam68 is highly expressed in embryonic NPCs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 003Figure 1 . Sam68 is highly expressed in NPCs and decreases during differentiation .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 003 To investigate whether Sam68 plays a role during neurogenesis , we first assessed whether its ablation affected the rate of NPC proliferation in the embryonic cortex . To this end , proliferating cells were labeled by injecting BrdU in pregnant females at 13 . 5 days post-coitum ( dpc ) 2\u00a0hr before embryo ( E13 . 5 ) collection . Proliferating cells ( BrdU-positive cells ) were significantly decreased in the cortex of Khdrbs1-/- embryos ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Likewise , SOX2+-NPCs , as well as the number of NPCs undergoing DNA synthesis ( SOX2+/BrdU+ cells ) , were also markedly affected ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) , indicating that fewer NPCs are present and proliferate in the E13 . 5 Khdrbs1-/- cortex . At this developmental stage , two main types of proliferating NPCs have been described in the mouse cortex ( Paridaen and Huttner , 2014; Taverna et al . , 2014 ) : RGCs and IPCs . RGCs express the transcription factor PAX6 and divide in the VZ and SVZ ( apical layers ) . IPCs express the transcription factor TBR2 , are derived from RGCs and divide one or more times away from the VZ before they generate post-mitotic neurons , which localize in the basal compartment of the cortex ( cortical layer ) and express the transcription factor TBR1 ( Englund et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , these three markers are expressed in sequentially ordered manner from the apical ( PAX6 ) to the basal ( TBR1 ) layer of the E13 . 5 neuroepithelium ( Figure 2A ) . Strikingly , total ( PAX6+ cells ) and proliferating RGCs ( PAX6+/BrdU+ cells ) and IPCs ( TBR2+ and TBR2+/BrdU+ cells ) were markedly reduced in the knockout cortex ( Figure 2B , C ) , whereas differentiated neurons ( TBR1+ cells ) were almost doubled ( Figure 2D ) . No TBR1-positive cell was labeled by BrdU in both wild-type and knockout embryos ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ) , confirming that these cells are post-mitotic neurons ( Englund et al . , 2005 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 004Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 005 The concomitant decrease in proliferating cells and increase in post-mitotic neurons observed in the knockout embryos suggested that , in the absence of Sam68 , NPCs are prone to exit the cell cycle and differentiate . To directly test this hypothesis , we injected pregnant females at 12 . 5dpc with BrdU and collected the embryos 48 hr later ( E14 . 5 ) ( Figure 3A ) . Co-staining with the Ki67 proliferation marker revealed that the fraction of NPCs that exited the cell cycle ( Ki67-/BrdU+/ BrdU+ cells ) in the E12 . 5-E14 . 5 time-frame was significantly increased in Khdrbs1-/- embryos ( Figure 3B ) . Furthermore , in wild-type embryos , ~30% of post-mitotic neurons were also labeled with BrdU ( Figure 3C ) , indicating that only a subset of NPCs underwent terminal differentiation within 48 hr . By contrast , this process was strongly enhanced in knockout embryos , with more than 80% of TBR1-positive cells that were labeled with BrdU ( Figure 3C ) . These results suggest that Sam68 is required to promote NPC self-renewal and to delay their differentiation into post-mitotic neurons in the mouse embryonic cortex . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 006Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 007 To determine if premature exit from the cell cycle and differentiation of NPCs has an effect on cortical expansion , we examined embryos at E17 . 5 , when neurogenesis is almost completed ( Englund et al . , 2005 ) . A 2-hr pulse showed that BrdU-positive proliferating cells were strongly decreased in Khdrbs1-/- cortex also at this stage , which was reflected in lower number of SOX2-positive NPCs ( Figure 3D , E ) . Furthermore , although they were indistinguishable in size from the wild type and heterozygote littermates ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , cortical expansion , measured as length from ventricular to pial surface , resulted significantly reduced in E17 . 5 Khdrbs1-/- embryos ( Figure 3D , E ) . These observations strongly suggest that ablation of Sam68 depletes the NPC pool and limits cortical expansion during neurogenesis . To elucidate the function of Sam68 in NPCs , we isolated them from wild type and knockout E13 . 5 cortices ( Bertram et al . , 2012 ) . NPCs grown under stemness conditions form characteristic neurospheres that rapidly grow in volume . We observed that knockout neurospheres grew at slower rate than wild type ones ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) , even though no differences were detected in the extent of cell death ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ) , and appeared irregular in shape with a tendency to form protrusions , due to cells that attached to the substrate and exited the sphere ( Figure 4A ) . Furthermore , when seeded at single cell level , knockout NPCs produced cytoplasmic extensions and attached to the plate , while wild-type cells remained in suspension ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Collectively , these features suggested that Khdrbs1-/- NPCs display a tendency to lose stemness and differentiate . To directly test this possibility , we performed clonogenic assays at different passages from NPC isolation . The clonogenic potential of wild-type NPCs slowly declined from\u00a0~45% to~25% after 7 passages in culture . However , loss of clonogenicity was markedly accelerated in knockout NPCs , reaching\u00a0~10% by passage 7 ( Figure 4B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 008Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 013 Next , we performed differentiation assays by switching NPCs to serum-containing medium for 1\u20133 days ( Bertram et al . , 2012; Compagnucci et al . , 2013 ) . Khdrbs1-/- NPCs differentiated with higher efficiency than wild-type cells , as indicated by the fewer cells that retained high expression of the stemness markers PAX6 and Nestin after 1 day ( Figure 4C , D ) . When differentiation was evaluated after 3 days , Khdrbs1-/- NPCs gave rise to significantly more neurons and oligodendrocytes than the corresponding wild-type NPCs ( Figure 4E , F ) . Furthermore , neurons generated by knockout NPCs exhibited higher complexity and more advanced differentiation stage , as documented by their increased branching level ( Figure 4E , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . These findings indicate that Khdrbs1-/- NPCs have reduced self-renewal proficiency and enhanced tendency to differentiate both in vivo and in vitro . We hypothesized that the reduced self-renewal capacity of Khdrbs1-/- NPCs was due to dysregulation of gene expression . Splicing-sensitive exon arrays identified 254 annotated genes regulated at the expression levels and 117 exons in 87 genes regulated at the splicing level in knockout NPCs ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A ) . Sam68 generally acted as a repressor of expression and the majority of targets were upregulated in knockout NPCs ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A ) . By contrast , Sam68 functioned as splicing enhancer for target exons , with little overlap between genes regulated at expression and splicing level ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A , B ) . Exon cassette was the predominant splicing event regulated by Sam68 in NPCs , followed by alternative last exon selection ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C ) . Notably , gene ontology analysis highlighted significant enrichment of functional categories related to neuron and oligodendrocyte properties ( cluster 1 in Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3D ) , thus supporting the pro-differentiation effect of Sam68 depletion in NPCs . For instance , genes encoding neuronal proteins like FXYD , a transmembrane modulator of the Na , K-ATPase enzyme linked to RETT syndrome ( Deng et al . , 2007 ) , and DDC , the DOPA decarboxilase that catalyzes dopamine production ( Bertoldi , 2014 ) , were upregulated ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Similarly , the oligodendrocyte-specific myelin-associated glycoprotein ( MAG ) and myelin basic protein ( MBP ) were strongly induced in Khdrbs1-/- NPCs ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3E; Figure 4-source data file 1 ) . These results confirmed at the molecular level the pro-differentiation phenotype exhibited by Khdrbs1-/- NPCs . Sam68 is mainly known for its direct role in the regulation of pre-mRNA processing ( Frisone et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , we further investigated the functional relevance of splicing-regulated genes to identify targets that could cause the phenotype of knockout NPCs . Among the 87 genes identified in the array ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B; Figure 4-source data file 2 ) , we focused on Aldh1a3 for its potential relevance in NPCs . Indeed , ALDH1A3 was shown to support self-renewal and clonogenic potential of cancer stem cells ( Duan et al . , 2016 ) , including glioma stem cells ( Mao et al . , 2013 ) , which can differentiate into neurons and glial cells like NPCs ( Lathia et al . , 2015 ) . The 5' region of the Aldh1a3 transcript ( exons 1\u20137 ) was upregulated in Khdrbs1-/- NPCs , whereas the 3' region ( exons 8\u201313 ) was downregulated ( Figure 5A , B , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Closer inspection of the array results highlighted the potential upregulation of a cryptic alternative last exon ( ALE ) residing in the proximal part of intron 7 , suggesting the existence of an alternative PAS in this intron and premature termination of the transcript ( Figure 5A ) . To verify this hypothesis , we performed 3'-RACE experiments using an oligo-dT anchor as reverse primer and forward primers located in the 5' region of intron 7 ( primer 1 ) and at the exon-intron junction ( primer 2 ) ( Figure 5C ) . Both primers amplified a distinct band from Khdrbs1-/- NPCs RNA , whereas only faint bands of various sizes were detected in wild type cells ( Figure 5D ) . Sequencing of the 3'-RACE products amplified in knockout NPCs revealed usage of an alternative PAS in intron 7 that is followed by two potential cleavage sites ( Figure 5E ) . To confirm this result , and to rule out accumulation of intron 7-containing pre-mRNA , we performed RT-PCR analyses using a forward primer in exon 6 and reverse primers located either upstream ( primers 1 and 2 ) or downstream ( primer 3 ) of the alternative PAS and cleavage sites ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . A spliced transcript containing intron 7 sequences could be amplified only with the primers situated upstream of the alternative PAS ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Furthermore , incubation of Khdrbs1-/- NPCs with 5 , 6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole ( DRB ) to block RNA transcription led to rapid decay of transcripts containing exon 3-intron 3 and intron 8-exon 8 sequences , indicative of pre-mRNA amplification , whereas the amplicon corresponding to exon 7-intron 7 sequences was stable up to 6 hr of incubation ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . These results confirm the presence of an alternative mRNA originating from premature termination of the Aldh1a3 transcript in knockout NPCs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 014Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 015 The canonical PAS sequences ( AAUAAA and AUUAAA ) correspond to optimal binding sites for Sam68 ( Ray et al . , 2013; Feracci et al . , 2016 ) . We hypothesized that Sam68 can bind the cryptic PAS in intron 7 in wild-type NPCs , thus preventing its recognition and blocking premature termination of the pre-mRNA . In line with this possibility , UV crosslink immunoprecipitation ( CLIP ) experiments showed strong recruitment of Sam68 in proximity of the cryptic PAS in intron 7 of the Aldh1a3 pre-mRNA , whereas binding in other regions was much weaker ( Figure 5F ) . These observations strongly suggest that Sam68 binding is required to mask the cryptic PAS and avoid premature termination of the Aldh1a3 transcript in mouse NPCs . Alternative PAS usage should lead to lower expression of the full-length ALDH1A3 protein and potential expression of a truncated ALDH1A3 protein . Western blot analysis confirmed the reduction of the full-length ALDH1A3 protein ( Figure 6A ) . However , we did not detect a band corresponding to the truncated protein ( ALDH1A3\u25b3 ) originating from the ALE in intron 7 ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Blocking the proteasome by incubation with MG132 did not lead to ALDH1A3\u25b3 accumulation , whereas interference with autophagy using chloroquine caused a mild accumulation of a protein product slightly smaller than the recombinant ALDH1A3\u25b3 ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Thus , ALDH1A3\u25b3 appears to be either very unstable or not expressed in NPCs . Nevertheless , to verify if such truncated protein could be functional , we evaluated its enzymatic activity . Full-length ALDH1A3 overexpressed in HEK293 exhibited enzymatic activity , as measured by reduction of NADPH ( Lindahl et al . , 1982 ) , whereas the ALDH1A3\u25b3 protein was completely inactive ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Since ALDH1A3 is a multimeric protein and homodimerization domains are found also in the N-terminus of the protein , which is present in ALDH1A3\u25b3 , we checked if ALDH1A3\u25b3 could contribute to ALDH activity in combination with the full-length protein . ALDH1A3\u25b3 efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with ALDH1A3 . However , its co-expression with the full-length protein reduced ALDH activity in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C , D ) . These observations suggest that , even if expressed at low levels , ALDH1A3\u25b3 could not contribute to ALDH activity in NPCs , but it could eventually exert a dominant-negative effect . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 016Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 017 In line with the reduced expression of full length ALDH1A3 , ALDH activity was markedly decreased in Khdrbs-/- NPCs ( Figure 6B ) . Furthermore , ALDH1A3 staining , which is restricted to the SOX2+ cells in VZ and SVZ of the developing cortex , was also significantly reduced in E13 . 5 knockout embryos with respect to wild-type littermates ( Figure 6C ) . These results indicate that Sam68 promotes ALDH1A3 protein expression in NPCs . The localization of ALDH1A3 suggests that its expression is restricted to RGCs . Moreover , we found that the full-length Aldh1a3 transcript rapidly declined upon differentiation of wild-type NPCs in culture ( Figure 6D ) . Importantly , this decline was accompanied by reduced Sam68 expression and increased expression of ALDH1A3\u25b3 ( Figure 6D ) , indicating that alternative 3'-end processing of the Aldh1a3 transcript is a physiological process of NPC differentiation controlled by fluctuations in Sam68 expression . In agreement with a direct modulation of Aldh1a3 expression by Sam68 , we also observed a highly significant correlation between expression of these genes in post-natal brain , with highest levels of both transcripts in olfactory bulb and cerebellum and lowest expression in the hypothalamus ( Figure 6E ) . Furthermore , expression of full-length Aldh1a3 transcript was reduced in olfactory bulb and cerebellum of Khdrbs1-/- mice , while the ALE-containing shorter transcript was induced ( Figure 6F ) . These results indicate that Sam68 is required to promote the expression and activity of ALDH1A3 through modulation of its pre-mRNA 3'-end processing in both embryonic and post-natal mouse brain . ALDH1A3 promotes self-renewal and clonogenic potential of glioma stem cells ( Mao et al . , 2013 ) , suggesting that its reduced expression may account for the phenotype of Khdrbs1-/- NPCs . To test this hypothesis , we transfected Khdrbs1-/- NPCs with constructs expressing either GFP-ALDH1A3 or GFP alone as control . Notably , expression of GFP-ALDH1A3 almost completely rescued the growth and clonogenic defects of knockout NPCs ( Figure 7A\u2013C ) . In line with its negative effect of ALDH activity , expression of ALDH1A3\u25b3 in wild-type NPCs blocked proliferation and interfered with formation of neurospheres , even though the cells remained alive ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Moreover , knockdown of endogenous ALDH1A3 in wild-type NPCs promoted neuronal differentiation to an extent similar to that observed in Khdrbs1-/- NPCs ( Figure 7D , E ) . Collectively , these results support the notion that Sam68 promotes NPC proliferation and represses their differentiation by maintaining high levels of full-length ALDH1A3 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 018Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 020 Stem cells often rely on anaerobic glycolysis for their proliferation and self-renewal ( Ito and Suda , 2014 ) and high glycolytic activity is required to prevent precocious NPC differentiation in vivo ( Lange et al . , 2016 ) . Since ALDH1A3 is involved in this metabolic pathway ( Mao et al . , 2013 ) , we investigated whether Sam68 expression affects anaerobic glycolysis in NPCs . Lower accumulation of the end-product lactate in the culture medium indicated that glycolytic activity was significantly reduced in Khdrbs1-/- NPCs compared to wild-type cells ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . A similar reduction in lactate production could be obtained by inhibiting ALDH activity using N , N-diethylaminobenzaldehyde ( DEAB ) ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B ) , a commonly used inhibitor of ALDH enzymes ( Morgan et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , knockdown of Aldh1a3 expression in wild type NPCs was sufficient to reduce anaerobic glycolysis to the levels of knockout cells , whereas overexpression of GFP-ALDH1A3 fully rescued lactate production in Khdrbs1-/- NPCs ( Figure 7F ) . Notably , reduced glycolytic activity accompanied differentiation of NPCs in vitro ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2C ) , concomitant with the decline in Sam68 and Aldh1a3 expression ( Figure 6D ) . These findings indicate that Sam68 maintains high levels of anaerobic glycolysis through modulation of ALDH1A3 protein expression . Next , to determine whether inhibition of ALDH activity and glycolytic metabolism could recapitulate the phenotype of Khdrbs1-/- NPCs , we treated wild-type cells with 50 \u00b5M DEAB , a dose that lowered anaerobic glycolysis to the levels observed in knockout NPCs ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . Strikingly , pharmacologic inhibition of ALDH activity in wild-type NPCs was sufficient to recapitulate the neurosphere growth ( Figure 7G ) and clonogenic defect ( Figure 7H ) of Khdrbs1-/- NPCs . These results strongly indicate that Sam68-dependent modulation of ALDH1A3 expression is required to maintain self-renewal capacity of NPCs through enhanced glycolytic metabolism ( Figure 8 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 021Figure 8 . Sam68 modulates neurogenesis through regulating ALDH1A3 expression . Schematic model of the function of Sam68 in the modulation of NPCs stemness . High Sam68 expression in NPCs of the neocortex insures high expression of ALDH1A3 protein and anaerobic glycolysis , thus promoting NPC self-renewal and cortical expansion . Upon differentiation , Sam68 expression declines , causing premature termination of Aldh1a3 transcription , reduced ALDH activity and glycolytic metabolism , thus enhancing NPC differentiation into post-mitotic neurons . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20750 . 021 \n The multifunctional RNA-binding protein Sam68 has been involved in several biological processes ( Bielli et al . , 2011; Frisone et al . , 2015 ) . Analysis of the mouse knockout model revealed that Sam68 is physiologically required for adipogenesis ( Richard et al . , 2005; Huot et al . , 2012 ) , male and female gametogenesis ( Paronetto et al . , 2009; Bianchi et al . , 2010; Paronetto et al . , 2011 ) and for regulation of synapse morphology and function in neurons ( Iijima et al . , 2011; Klein et al . , 2013 , 2015 ) . In most cases , its role was shown to require direct binding to select mRNAs and regulation of their splicing or translation . Notably , Khdrbs1-/- mice also displayed high perinatal lethality ( Richard et al . , 2005 ) , but the biological processes and the genes regulated by Sam68 during embryonic development are completely unknown . Our studies have now unveiled an unpredicted function of Sam68 as key regulator of the balance between stem and differentiated cells in the developing cortex . Ablation of this function in vivo caused anticipated NPC differentiation into post-mitotic neurons and limited the expansion of the neocortex . These findings highlight a novel Sam68-dependent pathway required for stem cell fate during brain development . Sam68 is strongly expressed in NPCs during stages of intense neurogenesis and cortical expansion ( E13 . 5\u2013E15 . 5 ) . These processes rely on the dual ability of RGCs to divide symmetrically and amplify their number , or asymmetrically to produce IPCs and post-mitotic neurons ( Paridaen and Huttner , 2014; Taverna et al . , 2014 ) . Knockout of Sam68 function significantly decreased proliferating NPCs ( both PAX6-positive RGCs and TBR2-positive IPCs ) at E13 . 5 , while leading to a sharp increase in TBR1-positive post-mitotic neurons . Birth-dating experiments indicated that Khdrbs1-/- NPCs were prone to exit the cell cycle and differentiate into neurons . The consequence of this premature NPC loss was a reduced expansion of the cortex at E17 . 5 , indicating that Sam68 is strictly required for the correct development of the mouse brain . Of note , the same loss of NPC stemness features could be recapitulated in vitro . First , Sam68 was strongly expressed in self-renewing E13 . 5 NPCs and its expression declined upon their differentiation . Second , Khdrbs1-/- NPCs were deficient in proliferation and clonogenicity while displaying enhanced tendency to differentiate . These observations indicate that Sam68 is required to maintain the proper balance between NPC self-renewal and differentiation and suggest that this protein supports stem-like properties in embryonic NPCs . Analysis of splicing-sensitive microarrays identified a relatively small subset of genes that are modulated by Sam68 in NPCs . These genes were selectively enriched in functional categories typical of neurons and glial cells and the majority of them were upregulated in Khdrbs1-/- NPCs , in line with the role of Sam68 in the promotion of stem-like features . Among these targets , we focused on ALDH1A3 , a metabolic enzyme that was identified as marker of cancer stem cells . Since ALDH1A3 supports the clonogenic and tumorigenic potential of cancer stem cells ( Duan et al . , 2016; Mao et al . , 2013 ) , we hypothesized that it might also promote stemness in NPCs and that Sam68 exerted its effects through modulation of ALDH1A3 expression . Indeed , Khdrbs1-/- NPCs displayed lower ALDH enzymatic activity and ALDH1A3 protein expression . Furthermore , by performing knockdown and gain-of-function studies , we demonstrated that regulation of ALDH1A3 expression accounts for many of the phenotypes of Khdrbs1-/- NPCs . Thus , our results link the physiological defect of knockout embryos to regulation of a specific target that promotes NPC self-renewal . Although it is generally accepted that pre-mRNA processing is a key regulatory step in brain development ( Raj and Blencowe , 2015 ) , few studies so far have directly linked these processes . Knockout of Ptbp2 was shown to alter the dynamics of embryonic neurogenesis and splicing of several genes , but the specific target gene ( s ) of PTBP2 that are responsible for defective neurogenesis were not identified ( Licatalosi et al . , 2012 ) . Likewise , the Pnky long noncoding RNA is required to expand the IPC population and it functions by interacting with PTBP1 and by regulating the expression and splicing of several neuronal genes ( Ramos et al . , 2015 ) , but the specific targets involved in its neurogenic function are unknown . Our study extends beyond these correlations and establishes a direct link between Sam68 and ALDH1A3 functions in the maintenance of NPC self-renewal capacity during neurogenesis . ALE selection is a prominent and unexpected pattern of regulation by Sam68 in NPCs . Mechanistically , we found that Sam68 directly binds to Aldh1a3 pre-mRNA in proximity of a cryptic PAS located in the 5' portion of intron 7 . Ablation of Sam68 unmasked this intronic PAS , causing alternative polyadenylation and premature termination of the Aldh1a3 transcript . Notably , the same regulation of Aldh1a3 alternative 3'-end processing occurred also in wild-type NPCs undergoing differentiation , concomitantly with the decline in expression of endogenous Sam68 and with acquisition of neuronal features . Thus , our results indicate that high levels of Sam68 are required to maintain Aldh1a3 expression and activity by suppressing premature termination of transcription of its pre-mRNA ( Figure 8 ) . This function of Sam68 resembles that of the U1 snRNP , which prevents global recognition of a large number of cryptic intronic PASs , thus insuring proper transcription termination of pre-mRNAs in the last exon ( Kaida et al . , 2010; Berg et al . , 2012 ) . However , Sam68 appears to play a much more restricted role than U1 snRNP , by controlling 3'-end processing of only a limited subset of transcripts . It will be interesting to investigate whether or not Sam68 functionally interacts with U1snRNP in this regulation and why its expression affects the alternative 3'-end processing of only few transcripts . Nevertheless , the studies shown here unveil a previously unappreciated role of Sam68 in alternative polyadenylation with physiological relevance for NPC differentiation . ALDH1A3 was shown to support clonogenicity and tumorigenicity of glioma stem cells by enhancing the glycolytic pathway ( Mao et al . , 2013 ) . Notably , very recent studies demonstrated that anaerobic glycolysis is required for NPC self-renewal in vivo ( Lange et al . , 2016 ) . We observed that lactate production through the glycolytic pathway was strongly reduced in Khdrbs1-/- NPCs . This phenotype could be recapitulated by Aldh1a3 knockdown or ALDH pharmacological inhibition in wild-type NPCs , or by promoting NPC differentiation in culture . Furthermore , the clonogenic potential of both wild-type and knockout NPCs was tightly linked to the extent of glycolysis , as modulation of this metabolic pathway by up- or down-regulating ALDH1A3 activity paralleled their self-renewal potential . By linking ALDH1A3 activity to anaerobic glycolysis in NPCs , we identify a novel metabolic route required for maintenance of stemness in neural precursors that is strictly under the control of Sam68 . Our work suggests that during neurogenesis , high levels of Sam68 expression are required for the correct processing of Aldh1a3 pre-mRNA , thus insuring high ALDH1A3 activity and fueling of the glycolytic pathway . Conversely , a decline in Sam68 expression leads to reduced expression and activity of ALDH1A3 and inhibits the glycolytic pathway , priming NPCs to enter the differentiation program ( Figure 8 ) . Importantly , the impaired balance between self-renewal and differentiation in Khdrbs1-/- mice results in depletion of the NPC pool and reduced expansion of the neocortex . Since altered neurogenesis and cortical development are associated to severe neuronal disorders like epilepsy , schizophrenia and autism ( Sun and Hevner , 2014; Fern\u00e1ndez et al . , 2016 ) , our findings suggest that fine-tuned regulation of Sam68 expression represents a safeguard mechanism during brain development . In conclusion , our study identifies Sam68 as a novel regulator of neurogenesis and highlights an unprecedented link between Sam68 , ALDH1A3 and the glycolytic pathway that supports maintenance of the NPC pool in the embryonic cortex . \n Animal experiments were performed according to protocol number 809_2015PR , following the Institutional guidelines of the Fondazione Santa Lucia and the approval of the Ethical Committee .

When the animal is in one location , a few neurons called \u2018place cells\u2019 will fire . If the animal moves to a new spot , other place cells fire instead . Each time the animal returns to that spot , the same place cells will fire . Thus , as the animal moves , a place-specific pattern of firing emerges that scientists can view by recording the cells' activity and which can be used to reconstruct the animal's position . After exploring a space , the hippocampus may replay the new place-specific pattern of activity during sleep . By doing so , the brain consolidates the memory of the space for return visits . Recent evidence now suggests that these mental rehearsals\u2014or internal simulations of the space\u2014may begin even before a new space has been explored . Now , \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir , Barry et al . report that whether an animal's brain simulates a first visit to a new space depends on whether the animal anticipates a reward . In the experiments , rats were allowed to run up to the junction in a T-shaped track . The animals could see into each of the arms , but not enter them . Food was then placed in one of the inaccessible arms . \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir , Barry et al . recorded the firing of place cells in the brain of the animals when they were on the track and during a rest period afterwards . The rats were then allowed onto the inaccessible arms , and again their brain activity was recorded . In the rest period after the rats first viewed the inaccessible arms , the place cell pattern that would later form the mental map of a journey to and from the food-containing arm was pre-activated . However , the place cell pattern that would become the mental map of the other inaccessible arm was not activated before the rat explored that area . Therefore , \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir , Barry et al . suggest that the perception of reward influences which place cell pattern is simulated during rest . An implication of these findings is that the brain preferentially simulates past or future experiences that are deemed to be functionally significant , such as those associated with reward . A future challenge will be to determine whether this goal-related simulation of unvisited spaces predicts and is needed for behaviour such as successful navigation to a goal .", "source": "Dominant theories of hippocampal function propose that place cell representations are formed during an animal's first encounter with a novel environment and are subsequently replayed during off-line states to support consolidation and future behaviour . Here we report that viewing the delivery of food to an unvisited portion of an environment leads to off-line pre-activation of place cells sequences corresponding to that space . Such \u2018preplay\u2019 was not observed for an unrewarded but otherwise similar portion of the environment . These results suggest that a hippocampal representation of a visible , yet unexplored environment can be formed if the environment is of motivational relevance to the animal . We hypothesise such goal-biased preplay may support preparation for future experiences in novel environments . \n We investigated whether the presence of an inaccessible goal in an unvisited portion of an environment was sufficient to elicit pre-activation ( \u2018preplay\u2019 ) of hippocampal place cell sequences that will subsequently represent runs through the unvisited environment . To this end , we recorded from ensembles of place cells ( O'Keefe and Dostrovsky , 1971 ) ( 4 rats , 37\u201366 place cells each , 212 cells in total ) while rats ran along a T-shaped track ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 , Table 1 ) with visible yet inaccessible arms ( Figure 1A ) \u2014RUN1 . One arm ( counter balanced between animals ) was subsequently cued with food while the animal remained on the track\u2014GOAL-CUE . During a rest period before RUN1 ( REST1 ) and after GOAL-CUE ( REST2 ) , spiking events\u2014periods of 300 ms or less , where at least 15% of cells were active ( Foster and Wilson , 2006; Diba and Buzsaki , 2007 ) \u2014were analysed . These spiking events were associated with significantly higher power in the ripple spectrum ( 80\u2013250 Hz ) than other comparable periods ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . To investigate whether paths on the cued and uncued arms were preplayed we assessed the match between the order in which cells fired during spiking events and during future runs on the arms ( RUN2 , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Specifically , we computed the rank-order correlations between spiking events and sequences of place cells active on the arms , referred to as templates ( Lee and Wilson , 2002; Foster and Wilson , 2006; Diba and Buzsaki , 2007; Dragoi and Tonegawa , 2011 ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . Preplay events were identified as those with either a significant positive or negative correlation\u2014a two-tailed test , each tail tested at the 97 . 5% level . These preplay events were found to exhibit higher power in the ripple spectrum than non-significant spiking events ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . To establish significance at the population level , the proportion of preplay events measured was compared to a null distribution generated by calculating correlations between place cell templates and shuffled sequences from events ( see Figure 1B\u2013C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06063 . 003Table 1 .

In contrast , prior to goal-cueing , two animals spent more time on the uncued side of the stem ( mean bias = 0 . 10 , see Table 1 for results for individual animals ) . Moreover , during GOAL-CUE all animals also spent more time looking towards the cued arm than the uncued arm ( mean bias = 0 . 13 ) , again this bias was not observed prior to goal-cueing when only one animal spent more time looking towards the cued arm ( mean bias = \u22120 . 11 , see Table 1 for results of individual animals ) . Furthermore , during RUN2 when the barrier was first removed and the food cue was no longer present , all four animals initially turned towards the cued arm and spent more time on the cued rather than the uncued arm ( mean bias = 0 . 96 , see Table 1 for results for individual animals ) . Consistent with the behavioural bias , in REST2 we found significant preplay of the yet unvisited cued arm ( 7 . 37% preplay events , p < 0 . 001 , binomial test vs chance , Figure 2A , D ) . Conversely , the uncued arm was not significantly preplayed ( 4 . 41% preplay events p = 0 . 33 , vs cued arm: p < 0 . 001 , Figure 2B , D ) . Similarly significant effects were found when animals were analysed individually ( see Figure 2D , Table 2 ) , although the results for one animal were based on a relatively small sample ( number of cued preplay events = 9 , R1838 ) , it still showed significant preplay of the cued arm . Moreover , the results were corroborated by a distribution-based analysis; namely , comparing the area under the curve ( AUC ) of bootstrapped cumulative distributions of absolute correlations for each arm to that of their shuffle distribution ( Figure 2A , B , cued: p < 0 . 001 , uncued: p = 0 . 22 , cued vs uncued: p = 0 . 0044 , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Preplay events of the cued arm were equally likely to represent paths to and from the cued arm ( 7 . 34% vs 7 . 40% p = 0 . 49 ) and to run towards ( \u2018forward\u2019 ) and away ( \u2018reverse\u2019 ) from the ends of the arms ( 6 . 93% vs 7 . 80% , p = 0 . 18 , Figure 3A ) . Moreover , the amount of preplay exhibited by each animal appeared to be predicted by the interest they displayed for the cued arm during GOAL-CUE ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Importantly , preferential preplay of the cued arm could not be explained by differences in the number of cells with fields on the arms ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B ) , spike-sorting quality ( cells with neighbouring place fields were as well separated in cluster-space as those with distant fields , p = 0 . 45 , 2-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test ) , place field stability on the two arms ( cued arm stability r = 0 . 54 vs uncued arm stability r = 0 . 49 , p = 0 . 15 ) or the location of place fields on the cued arm ( Figure 3B , p = 0 . 22 two-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test ) . In sum , we found during rest after goal-cueing , significant and preferential preplay of an unvisited and motivationally relevant portion of the environment . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06063 . 009Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06063 . 017 Does goal-cueing trigger preplay ? If so , there should be a greater number of significant pre-play events in REST2 compared to REST1 which was recorded before animals had visited or seen any part of the environment . Preplay of the cued arm was higher in REST2 than REST1 ( 7 . 37% vs 4 . 74% , p < 0 . 001 , Figure 2C , E ) , an effect that was seen for all animals ( Table 2 ) . Indeed , the cued arm was not significantly preplayed during REST1 ( 4 . 74% , p = 0 . 34 ) . Again , the result was corroborated using an AUC analysis ( Figure 2C , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Thus , we find preplay only occurs during rest periods recorded after goal-cueing . However , it is possible that the frequency of preplay might decrease as a function of the temporal gap between rest and behaviour . As such our failure to detect preplay in REST1 might be due to the greater delay between REST1 and RUN2 than between REST2 and RUN2 . To address this we analysed preplay of the stem ( i . e . , RUN1 ) during REST1 . We did not find preplay of the stem ( 4 . 12% preplay events , p = 0 . 44 , AUC analysis p = 0 . 053 , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 , Table 3 , RUN1 REST1 vs cued REST2: p < 0 . 001 ) . Consequently , these results imply that the preplay of the unvisited , yet visible , environment we observed in REST2 was driven by behavioural cueing of that environment . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06063 . 018Table 3 .

At what point does preferential preplay of the cued arm emerge ? Plausibly preplay might be initiated immediately when the cued arm is baited ( start of GOAL-CUE ) and simply persist into the subsequent REST2 period , alternatively the bias may only arise during rest . Due to the short duration of the goal-cueing period ( \u223c10 min ) a relatively small number of spiking events were recorded for the two arms during this period ( 172 and 170 for the cued and uncued arm respectively ) . However , based on a bootstrapped comparison of the AUC for absolute correlations from the cued and uncued arm vs shuffled distributions , we found that the cued but not the uncued arm was preplayed ( p = 0 . 02 , p = 0 . 24 respectively , Figure 3C , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . A direct comparison of the proportion of preplay events for the cued vs uncued arm was marginally not significant ( 6 . 4% vs 4 . 12% , p = 0 . 052 , see Table 4 for results for individual animals ) . Finally , to validate the results from this smaller dataset we carried out a further , more inclusive , analysis . Specifically , we tracked the temporal evolution of the bias in preplay by comparing the activity of cells from the cued and uncued arms at different points during the experiment . For every spiking event we computed the mean rate for cells that would subsequently have fields on the cued arm compared to those with fields on the uncued arm . During REST1 and RUN1 the future cued and uncued arm cells did not differ in activity , this was true for both the first and second half of these periods ( mean cued/uncued rate ratio: REST1 early ratio = 0 . 96 , p = 0 . 88 , REST1 late ratio = 1 . 04 p = 0 . 09 , RUN1 early ratio = 1 . 09 p = 0 . 32 , RUN1 late ratio = 1 . 18 p = 0 . 22 , Figure 3D ) . However , during GOAL-CUE cued arm cells were significantly more active than uncued arm cells , an effect that was most pronounced during the first half ( 5 min ) of the cueing period ( GOAL-CUE early ratio = 1 . 78 , p = 0 . 01 , late = 1 . 46 , p < 0 . 01 ) . Finally , the difference between the two groups persisted through the subsequent rest period , albeit attenuating with time ( REST2 early ratio = 1 . 30 p < 0 . 001 , REST2 late ratio = 1 . 10 p < 0 . 01 , Figure 3D ) . Importantly , control analyses showed that the bias in sequential preplay is not a mere product of differing activity levels of the cells for the two arms ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013D ) . Together , these findings indicate that biased pre-activation of future experiences is instantiated at the point when an environment becomes motivationally-relevant . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06063 . 019Table 4 .

Finally , to corroborate the results obtained from the rank-order analysis of spike sequences , we applied a Bayesian spatial reconstruction algorithm ( Davidson et al . , 2009; Bendor and Wilson , 2012 ) to the data from the two rest sessions . In contrast to the rank-order method , which utilised only the first spike emitted by each cell , the Bayesian decoding approach used all spikes emitted during an event . The Bayesian decoding approach uses the spiking activity of all simultaneously recorded place cells to calculate the posterior probability of an animal being at any position in the environment , based on a Poisson spiking framework . ( See Materials and methods; R1838 was excluded from this analysis due to low cell yield ) . The Bayesian decoder performed equally well on the cued and uncued arms ( Figure 4A , B , median error for both arms = 10 . 0 cm ) . Next , we applied the Bayesian decoding to spiking events during the rest sessions . First , we calculated the posterior probabilities for 5 ms non-overlapping bins , which generated a posterior probability matrix for each event ( Figure 4C , D ) . A spiking event that reflects a constant speed run through the environment will show an increased posterior along a line in the decoded posterior matrix . Therefore , for each spiking event we fit a line that accounted for the maximum variance and calculated its goodness of fit ( Figure 4C , D ) . To assess if that event represented a significant preplay event: we generated 1000 posterior probability matrices by shuffling the identities of cells included in the event , fit lines on all matrices , and calculated their goodness of fits . Events whose goodness of fits exceeded the 95th percentile of the shuffled distributions were labelled as preplay events . Again , during REST2 , we found preplay of the cued arm ( 7 . 64% of events , p < 0 . 001 , binomial test ) but not of the uncued arm ( 4 . 78% of events , p = 0 . 55 , vs cued = p < 0 . 001 , Figure 4E ) . Moreover , neither the cued nor the uncued arm were significantly preplayed in REST1 ( cued = 5 . 04% , p = 0 . 43 , uncued = 4 . 69% , p = 0 . 55 , Figure 4F ) . Thus , this alternative , more powerful , analysis replicates the exact same pattern of results as demonstrated by our main analysis; indicating that goal-triggered pre-activation of future place cell sequences is a robust and reliable phenomenon . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06063 . 020Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06063 . 020 \n Preplay of a visible , unvisited environment that has motivational relevance to an animal accords with various reports from neuropsychological and imaging studies indicating a crucial role for the hippocampus in processing future goals ( Spiers and Barry , 2015 ) , imagination , and future thinking ( Hassabis et al . , 2007; Schacter et al . , 2012 ) . Moreover , these findings agree with previous studies showing replay can be modulated by reward ( Cheng and Frank , 2008; Singer and Frank , 2009; Pfeiffer and Foster , 2013 ) but extend this modulatory influence to preplay of future , goal-oriented routes . In our data , sequences of place cells leading to and away from the goal were preplayed with similar frequency and occurred in both forward and reverse directions ( i . e . , positive and negative correlations ) . Replay of sequences leading towards goal locations has previously been linked with the planning of future trajectories ( Pfeiffer and Foster , 2013 ) . Plausibly the elevated proportion of preplay events we observed leading to the cued goal might also reflect route planning\u2014especially given the animals' subsequent preference for the cued arm . However , preplay of sequences leading from the cued goal towards the stem are less easily explained . On one hand it is possible that these sequences simply reflect planning for a return trip to the familiarity of the stem after retrieval of the food . However , reverse replay has often been characterised as a solution to the temporal credit assignment problem ( Foster and Wilson , 2006; Foster and Knierim , 2012 ) \u2014providing a learning mechanism to evaluate a sequence of actions that led to a successful outcome . In the context of preplay , when the cued arm has not been physically visited , an intriguing possibility is that paths towards the goal might be simulated using forwards preplay then evaluated and learnt from during reverse preplay , in a manner similar to that proposed to exist for periods of exploration and post-exploration rest ( Foster and Wilson , 2006; Diekelmann and Born , 2010; Buhry et al . , 2011 ) . Recently several studies have described \u2018de novo preplay\u2019\u2014preplay of environments that have yet to be experienced ( Dragoi and Tonegawa , 2011 , 2013 , 2013 ) \u2014which is believed to reflect the activity of preconfigured cell ensembles ( McNaughton et al . , 1996 ) that subsequently become bound to sensory cues in the environment . We did not observe de novo preplay in the current experiment ( no preplay of stem during REST1 ) . Although the origin of this discrepancy is unclear , we note that several other studies also do not find de novo preplay for a completely novel environment ( Wilson and McNaughton , 1994; Lee and Wilson , 2002 ) . However , it seems likely that other environmental factors present here but absent in the do novo preplay studies ( Dragoi and Tonegawa , 2011 , 2013 , 2014 ) , such as the barrier , and visible but inaccessible arms , might have ameliorated this phenomenon . Indeed , the AUC analysis comparing spiking events recorded during REST1 against the stem template ( RUN1 , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) was narrowly not significant ( p = 0 . 053 ) , suggesting that perhaps with more data or a simpler environment we might have found de novo preplay for the stem . In a similar vein one might also have expected to observe a background rate of de novo preplay for the uncued arm during REST2 . Again it seems possible that the complexity of the environment worked against such an effect in that the motivationally relevant cued arm was preplayed at the expense of the uncued arm . What remains to be understood is if this bias reflects an active process , simulating trajectories associated with the goal , or if the relevance of the cued arm simply allows it to more effectively capture preconfigured cell assemblies . In sum , our data indicates that preplay of an unvisited environment can be initiated in response to viewing that environment if it is relevant to future goals\u2014features that were absent in previous studies investigating the formation of hippocampal representations for novel spaces ( Wilson and McNaughton , 1994; Lee and Wilson , 2002; Rowland et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , although our data does not provide direct support for de novo preplay it also does not argue against it , and is consistent with the hypothesis that the hippocampus supports the construction of novel spatial experiences as suggested by other authors ( for example see Dragoi and Tonegawa ( 2014 ) ) . These results are consistent with the notion that place cells form preconfigured assemblies or \u2018charts\u2019 ( McNaughton et al . , 1996 ) \u2014an active but unassigned chart being associated with the cued arm during GOAL-CUE , but do not preclude the possibility that place cell firing is driven in a feed-forward manner ( e . g . , Hartley et al . , 2000 ) . We conclude that these findings support the hypothesised role of preplay for preparation for future experiences ( Diba and Buzsaki , 2007; Erdem and Hasselmo , 2012; Foster and Knierim , 2012; Pfeiffer and Foster , 2013 ) but extend it to simulating future experiences in environments yet to be actively explored . It remains to be seen if the ability of the hippocampus to construct future spatial sequences is related to the generation of more abstract temporal associations ( Kraus et al . , 2013; Eichenbaum and Cohen , 2014 ) . \n Four male lister-hooded rats were used in this study . All procedures were approved by the UK Home Office , subject to the restrictions and provisions contained in the Animals ( Scientific Procedures ) Act of 1986 . Two rats ( 330\u2013333 g at implantation ) received two microdrives , each carrying four tetrodes of twisted 25 \u00b5m HM-L coated platinum iridium wire ( 90% and 10% , respectively; California Fine Wire ) , targeted to the left and right CA1 . One animal ( 350 g ) received a single microdrive , carrying eight tetrodes , targeting right CA1 . Finally , one animal ( 425 g ) received one microdrive carrying four tetrodes of 12- \u00b5m wire targeted to the mEC and one carrying four tetrodes of 17- \u00b5m wire targeted to contralateral CA1 . Only single units from the CA1 implant were included in this study . The 12 and 17- \u00b5m wires were platinum-plated to reduced impedance to 200\u2013300 k\u03a9 at 1 kHz . Rats were maintained at 90% of free-feeding weight , and were housed individually on a 12-hr light/dark cycle . After surgery , rats were food deprived with ad libitum access to water . Screening was performed post-surgically after a 1-week recovery period . An Axona recording system ( Axona Ltd . , UK ) was used to acquire the single-units , and positional data ( for details of the recording system see Barry et al . [Barry et al . , 2007] ) . The position and head direction of the rats were captured using an overhead video camera to record the position using a light-emitting diode ( LED ) on the animals' head-stages ( 50 Hz ) . Tetrodes were gradually advanced over days until place cells were found . We used a T-shaped track , raised 43 cm off the ground . The track consisted of 10 cm wide runways covered in black rubber , the stem was 222 cm long and the arms 200 cm from tip to tip . Animals were not habituated to running on linear tracks prior to the experiment . However , all animals had been trained to forage for rice in a square enclosure located in the same room but outside the curtained area . Initially , to prevent animals from accessing the arms , a barrier was placed on the stem 22 cm from the junction with the arms . The barrier consisted of a grill of vertical wooden bars spaced so the animals could easily see through but could not scale it . The apparatus was located in a curtained environment , and two distal landmarks were mounted on the curtain on either side of the maze for orientation . To encourage even distribution of place fields along the track , textured local cues were placed along the stem and arms . These five different cues were sheets of: black rubber , grey cardboard , black polypropylene , plaster tape , and sandpaper each approximately 20 cm long and 10 cm wide . For rest periods , the animal was placed in a cylindrically shaped enclosure ( 18 cm diameter \u00d7 61 cm high ) with a towel placed in the bottom . Prior to the experiment the animal was familiarised with the rest enclosure for a minimum of 120 min . The rest enclosure was located beside the track during rest periods , but was not present during the other periods . Prior to running on the track , animals were placed in the rest enclosure for at least 60 min\u2014REST1 ( if the animals rested for less than 40 min during a session then the session was extended in order to obtain at least 40 min worth of recording ) . During this period the animals' quiescence was assessed based on speed estimates , derived by measuring the movement of the LED attached to the animals' headstages . Following REST1 , RUN1 was initiated by placing the rats at the end of the stem facing away from the track . During RUN1 animals were encouraged to run up and down the stem by the experimenter rewarding alternate ends of the stem with rice grains . During this period animals were prevented from running onto the arms by the barrier . Once animals had completed 20 laps , the experimenter stopped baiting the stem and instead baited the end of one of the arms ( GOAL-CUE ) , which was inaccessible yet visible to the animal ( cue located ca . 1 m from the animal ) . The cued arm was counterbalanced between animals . The animals had good visual access to the inaccessible arms as they could see between the wooden dowels of the barrier . The experimenter stood by the end of the cued arm to elicit further interest . Animals were allowed to remain on the track for at least a further 10 min ( GOAL-CUE ) . Following RUN1 , the animals were placed back into the rest enclosure for at least 60 min\u2014REST2 . Following REST2 , animals were put back on the end of the stem facing away from the track . The barrier at the end of the stem was removed and the animals were allowed to traverse both the stem and arms in alternate L-shaped laps for each arm\u2014RUN2 . On the first lap during RUN2 , animals were allowed to choose which arm they turned to when reaching the end of the stem . On subsequent laps animals were forced to alternate\u2014a barrier ( the same as the one used for RUN1 ) was placed at the junction of the T-maze to occlude each arm in turn , and was moved between trials by the experimenter . The animals completed 20 L-shaped laps for each arm . For each rest period , times where at least 15% of cells from a given template fired within 300 ms and were bound by at least 50 ms of silence were selected as \u2018spiking events\u2019 ( for R1838 , which had a lower cell yield than the other rats , a minimum of 4 cells were required to be active ) . If a single cell fired more than one spike within this period , the first spike was counted and other spikes disregarded . The extent to which templates were represented in the spiking events was assessed using template-matching ( Lee and Wilson , 2002; Foster and Wilson , 2006; Diba and Buzsaki , 2007 ) . Specifically , the temporal sequence of cells in spiking events and the order of their corresponding peaks in the template was compared . If future template sequences are preplayed in rest the order in which cells fire during spiking events would be expected to resemble the order in which they fire on the track . In other words , one would expect the spike sequence in events and in future template sequence to be more correlated than predicted by chance . To determine if each template was being significantly preplayed we compared the proportion of spiking events that individually correlated with that template with the proportion expected by chance ( as predicted by a shuffling procedure ) . Specifically , the Spearman's rank-order correlations between each spiking event and the current template was computed and the number yielding significant correlations ( based on a two-tailed test , each tail tested at the 97 . 5% level ) was recorded; these were labelled preplay events . Both positive as well as negative significant correlations were categorised as preplay events , as previous studies have reported that replay can reactivate a place cell sequence in the forward or reverse order ( Lee and Wilson , 2002; Diba and Buzsaki , 2007 ) . Next , the sequence of spikes in each event was randomly permuted ( shuffled ) 100 times by randomly re-assigning cell IDs such that spikes from the same cell were never separated . For each permutation the Spearman's rank-order correlation and matching p-value were calculated , again the proportion of significant correlations was recorded; this value represented the proportion of preplay events expected by chance . Finally , the proportion of shuffled events that had a significant correlation with the future template sequence was compared to the number obtained for the unshuffled data using a one sample binomial test . To assess whether the cued arm was preplayed more than the uncued arm we directly compared the total number of events and number of preplay events , again using a binomial test . A similar approach was used for comparing number of preplay events in REST1 and REST2 . Subsequently , we corroborated these results using an alternative- distribution-based , analysis . Namely , we assessed whether the AUC of the cumulative distribution of absolute correlations for each arm in each of the two rest sessions differed from their shuffle distribution . Specifically , for each arm and each period , we bootstrapped the population of absolute correlations obtained between templates and spiking events 10 , 000 times . On each iterations we computed the difference between the AUC of the cumulative distribution of the bootstrapped data vs the AUC of the bootstrapped shuffled data correlations , which had been obtained previously . 95% confidence intervals ( 2 . 5% and 97 . 5% percentiles used , i . e . , a two-tailed test ) were determined from these difference scores and were used to assess whether the two distributions differed significantly . Specifically , if the interval did not contain 0 then we concluded the two distributions were significantly different . To analyse preplay during GOAL-CUE we performed the same analysis for spiking events emitted while the animal was on the stem . Specifically , we only considered events recorded when an animal's velocity was below 10 cm/s and the animal was located within 20 cm ( 10% of track length ) of the barrier . As an additional control for differences in the number of cells contributing to each template we repeated the analyses described above after first down-sampling each template to equate the number of cells ( i . e . , to match the length of the shortest template ) . Specifically , if the shortest template consisted of 20 cells while another template consisted of 30 cells , we randomly removed 10 cells from the longer template . Moreover , we repeated this down-sampling process a 100 times , each time removing a random set of 10 cells . We then ran the preplay analysis as before\u2014estimating the number of preplay events for each down-sampled cued and uncued template and comparing them to each other and chance levels . A similar procedure was used to equate activity rates for cued and uncued templates during the two rest periods . Namely , the distribution of events , containing different numbers of cells , were equated for the different templates . For example , if one template had 50 events with 5 cells active and another only had 40 events , we randomly removed 10 events from the former template . This process was then repeated for events of different lengths . As before the entire down sampling procedure was repeated 100 times . As well as controlling for quiescent rate differences this analysis also controls for the number of events for each template . To analyse the temporal evolution of preplay across the entire experiment we used an alternative approach to the template-matching described above . This was done due to the short duration of the RUN1 and GOAL-CUE periods ( \u223c10 min ) , which limited the power of the template-matching approach . As an alternative , we computed the mean rate of future cued and uncued arm cells during spiking events for each half of all experimental periods ( i . e . , REST1 , RUN1 , GOAL-CUE and REST2 ) . If a cell was active on both arms we excluded it , unless the rate on one arm was at least twice as high as the rate on the other arm . To assess statistical significance of rate differences we bootstrapped the event rates for the cued and uncued arm cells 10 , 000 times . We then computed the mean ratio between the cued and uncued arm rates ( cued/uncued ) for each bootstrap , and estimated the 95% confidence interval . If the interval did not contain 1 then we deemed the rate difference significant . To corroborate results obtained from the rank-order correlation between spikes and field position we also applied a Bayesian reconstruction algorithm to spike sequences recorded during events . Following Zhang et al . , 1998 , and Davidson et al . , 2009 , using non-overlapping temporal windows , we computed the probability distribution across position based on ratemaps generated from RUN2 ( Davidson et al . , 2009; Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . Specifically during a time window ( T ) the spikes generated by N place cells was K = ( k1 , \u2026 , ki , \u2026 , kN ) , where ki was the number of spikes fired by the ith cell . The probability of observing K in time T given position ( x ) was taken as: ( 1 ) P ( K|x ) =\u220fPoisson ( ki , T\u03b1i ( x ) ) =\u220fi=1N ( T\u00d7\u03b1i ( x ) ) kiki ! \u00d7e\u2212T\u03b1i ( x ) , where x indexes the 1 cm spatial bins defined on the arms of the apparatus and \u03b1i ( x ) is the firing rate of the ith place cell at position x , derived from RUN2 ratemaps . To compute the probability of the animals' position given the observed spikes we applied Bayes' rule , assuming a flat prior for position ( P ( x ) ) , to give: ( 2 ) P ( x|K ) =R ( \u220fi=1N\u03b1i ( x ) ki ) exp ( \u2212T\u2211i=1N\u03b1i ( x ) ) , where R is a normalising constant depending on T and the number of spikes emitted . Note we do not use the historic postion of the animals' to contstrain P ( x|K ) thus the probability estimate in each T is independent of its neighbours . To validate the effectiveness of the reconstruction algorithm it was used to decode the animals' actual position during RUN2 . For each T ( 200 ms ) location was decoded by taking the peak of the P ( x|K ) distribution . Decoded estimates of location were compared with true location to obtain a measure of the absolute decoding error . To decode offline activity , posterior probability matrices were produced for events with \u22657 active cells using 5 ms non-overlapping time windows ( T ) . To decode the probability matrices we used a method similar to Davidson et al . ( 2009 ) , fitting a straight line\u2014equivalent to a constant speed trajectory\u2014to each matrix . Lines were defined with a gradient ( V ) and intercept ( c ) , equivalent to the velocity and starting location of the trajectory . The goodness of fit of a given line ( R ( V , c ) ) was defined as the proportion of the probability distribution that lay within 20 cm of it . Specifically where P is the probability matrix obtained from ( 2 ) : ( 3 ) R ( V , c ) =1n\u2211t=0n\u22121P ( |x ( t ) \u2212 ( V . t . T+c ) |\u2264d ) , where t index the time bins of width T and d is set to 20 cm . R ( V , c ) was maximised using an exhaustive search to test all combinations of V between \u221250 ms\u22121 and 50 ms\u22121 in 0 . 2 ms\u22121 increments ( excluding slow trajectories with speeds > \u22122 ms\u22121 and < 2 ms\u22121 ) and c between \u221215 m and 16 m in 0 . 01 m increments . To assess the presence of preplay in each event we compared the goodness of fit of the best straight line trajectory with the best fits made to 1000 posterior probability matrices generated by shuffling the identities of cells included in the event . Events whose best fit line exceeded the 95th percentile of its own shuffled distribution we labelled as preplay events . To eliminate the possibility that poor cluster isolation might contribute to the observed preplay ( such as mistakenly dividing a complex spike into two clusters ) , we analysed the cluster separation between every pair of place cells recorded from the same tetrode . Thus , for each spike the first three principle components of the waveform recorded on each of the four channels of the tetrode were calculated . Thus , 12 features ( 4 channels \u00d7 3 principle components ) defined each spike . Based on these features the squared Mahalanobis distance between that spike and the centre of another cluster was calculated , using the covariance matrix for all spikes belonging to the cluster . This process was then repeated for all spikes in a given cluster and the mean Mahalanobis' distance calculated . Clusters of spikes originating from a single cell but which have mistakenly been assigned to two or more cells will be identified by low a Mahalanobis distance and proximate place fields . We divided cell pairs into two groups\u2014those with short Mahalanobis distances ( less than the median ) and those with long distances ( greater than or equal to the median ) . The distribution of place field separation for the two groups was then compared using a 2-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test . To eliminate the possibility that preplay of the cued arm during REST2 merely reflects familiarity with the proximal portions of the cued arm during GOAL-CUE we assessed whether off-line spikes were more likely to be associated with the first half of the arm ( i . e . , closest to the stem ) vs the second half ( excluding the first 22 cm that are common to both arms ) . We computed the proportion of spikes representing proximal locations and assessed whether the proportion differed significantly ( using a binomial test ) from what one would expect based on the place field distribution of the cued arm . We also repeated the same analysis for the uncued arm . Finally , to assess whether the distribution of preplayed locations ( normalised by place field distribution ) for the two arms differed significantly from a uniform distribution we used a two-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test . Finally , to assess place field stability on the cued and uncued arm we split the RUN2 session in half ( based on odd and even samples ) and generated ratemaps for each half . We then calculated the correlation between the two ratemaps ( bin-wise Pearson product\u2013moment correlation coefficients were calculated after first removing unvisited bins and any bin pairs that had mutual 0 Hz firing rates ) and compared correlations obtained for the cued and uncued arms using a two-sample t-test . LFP from CA1 was recorded at 4 . 8 kHz throughout the experiment . To analyse sharp-wave ripples ( O'Keefe and Nadel , 1978; Buzsaki et al . , 1992 ) the LFP was band-pass filtered between 80 and 250 Hz . An analytic signal was constructed using the Hilbert transform , taking the form: ( 4 ) sa ( tk ) =s ( tk ) +iH[s ( tk ) ] , where H specifies the Hilbert transform , s ( tk ) is the filtered LFP signal , tk = k\u0394 , where k = 1 , . . . , K indexes the time-step and \u0394 is the inverse of the sampling rate . An instantaneous measure of power was found by taking the squared complex modulus of the signal at each time point . This measure was then down sampled to 50 Hz to match the position sampling rate , and finally was smoothed with a boxcar filter of width 0 . 1 s . Two-tailed independent samples t-tests were used to compare power in the ripple-band during significant ( i . e . , preplay events ) and non-significant spiking events and to compare power during significant spiking events and periods outside of spiking events . Rats were anaesthetised ( 4% isoflurane and 4 l/min O2 ) , injected intra-peritoneal with an overdose of Euthatal ( sodium pentobarbital ) after which they were transcardially perfused with saline followed by a 4% paraformaldehyde solution ( PFA ) . Brains were carefully removed and stored in PFA which was exchanged for a 4% PFA solution in PBS ( phosphate buffered saline ) with 20% sucrose 2\u20133 days prior to sectioning . Subsequently , 40\u201350 \u03bcm frozen coronal sections were cut using a cryostat , mounted on gelatine-coated glass slides and stained with cresyl violet . Images of the sections were acquired using an Olympus microscope , Xli digital camera ( XL Imaging Ltd . ) . Sections in which clear tracks from tetrode bundles could be seen were used to determine the location of cells recorded . Animals' interest in the cued arm during goal-cueing was assessed as follows . The portion of the stem within 20 cm of the barrier was notionally divided in two long-ways to yield a cued and uncued side . Time spent on the two sides was determined based on the animals' tracked positions . Finally , to express interest in the cued arm as a single behavioural measure , the difference between the time spent on the cued vs the uncued side was divided by the total time spent on that section of the track . Thus , a value above 0 indicates that an animal spent more time on cued side than the uncued side . As an additional measure of the animals' interest in the cued arm during the goal-cueing period we assessed the amount of time animals spent looking toward the cued arm ( while the animals' velocity was at least 5 cm/s , head direction was inferred by tracking a single LED which requires the animal to be moving in order to get accurate head direction estimates ) . Again , preference for the cued arm was expressed as a single behavioural measure by subtracting the amount of time spent with the head oriented towards the cued arm from the time spent with the head oriented towards the uncued arm and dividing by the total time spent with the head oriented towards either arm . Finally , to assess the animals' preference for the cued arm during the first lap of RUN2 , the difference between the time spent on the cued arm vs the uncued arm during the first 3 s following the animals' entry onto the arms was divided by the total time spent on either arm ."}

First , an enzyme called a DNA helicase separates the two strands of the DNA double helix . This forms a structure called a replication fork that has two exposed single strands . Other enzymes called DNA polymerases then use each strand as a template to build a new matching DNA strand . DNA polymerases build the new DNA strands by joining together smaller molecules called nucleotides . One of the new DNA strands\u2014called the \u2018leading strand\u2019\u2014is built continuously , while the other\u2014the \u2018lagging strand\u2019\u2014is made as a series of short fragments that are later joined together . Building the leading strand requires the helicase and DNA polymerase to work closely together . However , it was not clear how these two enzymes coordinate their activity . Now , Nandakumar et al . have studied the helicase and DNA polymerase from a virus that infects bacteria and have pinpointed the exact positions of the enzymes at a replication fork . The experiments revealed that both the polymerase and helicase contribute to the separating of the DNA strands , and that this process is most efficient when the helicase is only a single nucleotide ahead of the polymerase . Further experiments showed that the helicase stimulates the polymerase by helping it to bind to nucleotides , and that the polymerase stimulates the helicase by helping it to separate the DNA strands at a faster rate . The next challenge is to investigate the molecular setup that allows the helicase and polymerase to increase each other's activities .", "source": "Leading strand DNA synthesis requires functional coupling between replicative helicase and DNA polymerase ( DNAP ) enzymes , but the structural and mechanistic basis of coupling is poorly understood . This study defines the precise positions of T7 helicase and T7 DNAP at the replication fork junction with single-base resolution to create a structural model that explains the mutual stimulation of activities . Our 2-aminopurine studies show that helicase and polymerase both participate in DNA melting , but each enzyme melts the junction base pair partially . When combined , the junction base pair is melted cooperatively provided the helicase is located one nucleotide ahead of the primer-end . The synergistic shift in equilibrium of junction base pair melting by combined enzymes explains the cooperativity , wherein helicase stimulates the polymerase by promoting dNTP binding ( decreasing dNTP Km ) , polymerase stimulates the helicase by increasing the unwinding rate-constant ( kcat ) , consequently the combined enzymes unwind DNA with kinetic parameters resembling enzymes translocating on single-stranded DNA . \n Replicative helicases and DNA polymerases ( DNAPs ) are not efficient at unwinding the duplex DNA when they are working independently . The unwinding rates are slower than their translocation rates on single-stranded ( ss ) DNA and slower than the rates of DNA replication ( Kim et al . , 1996; Delagoutte and von Hippel , 2001; Galletto et al . , 2004; Stano et al . , 2005; Lionnet et al . , 2007; Donmez and Patel , 2008 ) . Moreover , the unwinding rates of isolated helicases decrease steeply with increasing GC percentage in the duplex DNA , therefore , assisting forces that destabilize the junction base pairs stimulate the helicase ( Galletto et al . , 2004; Johnson et al . , 2007; Lionnet et al . , 2007; Donmez and Patel , 2008 ) . However , in the presence of an actively synthesizing replicative DNAP , the unwinding rates of the helicase become fast and GC independent ( Kim et al . , 1996; Delagoutte and von Hippel , 2001; Stano et al . , 2005; Manosas et al . , 2012b; Pandey and Patel , 2014 ) . Similarly , replicative DNAPs on their own have limited strand displacement synthesis activity , restricted to 4\u20136 base pairs in T7 DNAP ( Stano et al . , 2005; Yuan and McHenry , 2009; Pandey and Patel , 2014 ) . The isolated DNAPs often stall and move backward to excise the nascent DNA using their proofreading exonuclease activity when faced with downstream duplex DNA ( Manosas et al . , 2012a ) . The presence of helicase or single-stranded DNA-binding protein ( SSB ) inhibits processive excision of the nascent DNA and allows DNAP to catalyze fast and processive strand displacement synthesis ( Manosas et al . , 2012b; Pandey and Patel , 2014 ) . Originally identified in prokaryotic systems ( T7 , T4 bacteriophage , Escherichia coli ) , this functional coupling between the helicase and DNAP is found also in eukaryotic replication systems ( Kang et al . , 2012 ) . Several models have attempted to explain the functional coupling between replicative helicases and DNAPs . The underlying theme of the helicase only unwinding models is that the helicase unwinds the duplex DNA creating ssDNA template for the DNAP and the DNAP traps the displaced ssDNA through DNA synthesis ( Delagoutte and von Hippel , 2001; Stano et al . , 2005 ) . Recent studies of bacteriophage T7 and T4 DNAPs suggest alternative models indicating that DNAP aids the helicase by destabilizing the first few base pairs of the double-stranded ( ds ) DNA ( Manosas et al . , 2012a , 2012b ) . Exonuclease mapping showed that T7 DNAP is located with the T7 helicase in close proximity to the fork junction and in a position to influence the junction base pairs ( Pandey and Patel , 2014 ) . To understand functional coupling between helicase and DNAP , we need to understand the basic mechanism of DNA unwinding by each enzyme . Although the mechanism of replicative DNAPs is well characterized on ssDNA template ( Patel et al . , 1991; Doublie et al . , 1998; Delagoutte , 2012 ) , there is little known about the mechanism of DNA unwinding-synthesis on duplex DNA template . Similarly , there are no structures of replisomes with the exception of a small angle X-Ray scattering structure of the T7 helicase-T7 DNAP bound to ssDNA and primer template DNA , respectively ( Kulczyk et al . , 2012 ) . However , the low-resolution structure in the absence of a replication fork DNA does not provide the location of the DNAP and helicase at the replication fork junction to understand which enzyme is involved in melting the base pair at the fork junction . In addition to structural questions such as the positioning of the helicase and DNAP at the replication fork , many aspects of the mechanism of functional coupling remain unexplored . For example , T7 and E . coli DNAPs are capable of strand displacement synthesis in the presence of SSB with rates comparable to their replication rates ( Yuan and McHenry , 2009; Pandey and Patel , 2014 ) . Hence , the specific role of the helicase in stimulating the synthesis activity of DNAP remains unclear . As combined enzymes , T7 helicase and T7 DNAP exhibit highly coordinated catalysis , whereby helicase hydrolyzes one dNTP for every dNMP incorporated by the DNAP ( Pandey and Patel , 2014 ) . This implies that the two enzymes coordinate their steps of nucleotide binding ( 2\u2032-deoxythymidine 5\u2032-triphosphate ( dTTP ) binding to T7 helicase and dNTP binding to T7 DNAP ) and catalysis ( dTTP hydrolysis and dNMP incorporation ) , but there is no model that explains how these steps are coupled between the two enzymes during active leading strand synthesis . The studies in this paper use a combination of 2-aminopurine ( 2-AP ) fluorescence and transient-state kinetics to investigate the unwinding mechanisms of T7 DNAP and T7 helicase as isolated enzymes and as combined enzymes . The kinetics indicates that DNAP and helicase use different mechanisms to unwind DNA , but the mechanisms when coupled generate an efficient replisome . In the replisome , T7 DNAP stimulates the helicase by increasing the unwinding kcat , and T7 helicase stimulates the DNAP by decreasing the dNTPs Km . The 2-AP studies probe DNA melting with single base pair resolution and show that the isolated enzymes are not as efficient at melting the fork junction as compared to the combined enzymes . However , T7 DNAP with its ability to melt two base pairs ahead of the primer-end positions T7 helicase two nucleotides ahead with efficient and synergistic melting of the junction base pair . Overall , these studies provide both kinetic and structural basis to understand how helicase and polymerase mutually stimulate each other's activities during leading strand synthesis . \n To measure the DNA-unwinding kinetics in real time , we labeled the 3\u2032-end of the lagging strand with fluorescein and the 5\u2032-end of the leading strand with a black hole quencher ( BHQ1 ) ( Figure 1A ) . The fluorescence intensity of fluorescein-labeled lagging strand is quenched by BHQ1 when the DNA is duplexed , but when the lagging strand is unwound by T7 DNAP + E . coli SSB the fluorescence intensity increases ( Figure 1B ) . We find that T7 DNAP on its own does not unwind the 40 bp replication fork at fast rates , which is consistent with our previously reported gel-based studies showing T7 DNAP stalling after 4\u20136 base pairs synthesis ( Stano et al . , 2005; Pandey and Patel , 2014 ) and this can be overcome by adding SSB ( Pandey and Patel , 2014 ) . Indeed , T7 DNAP fully unwinds the fork DNA with E . coli SSB in the reactions . Note that we can replace E . coli SSB with T7 gp2 . 5 ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ) ( Myers and Romano , 1988; Nakai and Richardson , 1988; Pandey and Patel , 2014 ) . However , we have used E . coli SSB because of its higher affinity for ssDNA ( 0 . 1\u201310 nM ) ( Molineux et al . , 1975 ) , requiring lower amounts of SSB for the same degree of stimulation as with T7 gp2 . 5 ( 200 nM SSB vs 3 \u03bcM T7 gp2 . 5 ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . The E . coli SSB does not unwind DNA on its own ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . In these experiments , T7 DNAP and E . coli SSB were preassembled on the fork DNA , and DNA unwinding was initiated with dNTPs and Mg ( II ) in a stopped-flow instrument at 18\u00b0C . By preassembling the DNAP-SSB-DNA complex , we bypass the slow enzyme binding steps and synchronize the unwinding reactions . Therefore , the unwinding kinetics shows a presteady state time lag prior to fluorescence increase ( Figure 1B ) . The lag time represents the time of unwinding , because it gets shorter when the duplex DNA to be unwound is 25 bp rather than 40 bp ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . Therefore , the kinetics were fit to the n-step model ( Levin et al . , 2009 ) to extract the base pair unwinding rates ( Appendix\u2014Section 1 and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C ) . These average unwinding rates include time spent in unwinding the 40 bp fork DNA and time spent in any paused states . The unwinding rates of T7 DNAP ( with SSB ) increase in a hyperbolic manner with increasing dNTPs concentrations with each of the GC forks ( Figure 1C ) . At low-dNTPs concentration , the unwinding rates are GC-sensitive , but the rates reach a similarly high value at saturating dNTPs concentrations . Thus , the unwinding kcat remains nearly constant and ranges from 190 to 140 bp/s as GC percentage increases ( Figure 1D ) . However , the dNTPs Km increases steeply from 40 \u03bcM to 270 \u03bcM as the GC percentage increases ( Figure 1E ) . This indicates that DNA unwinding-synthesis by T7 DNAP ( with SSB ) is rate-limited by base pair separation at low-dNTPs concentrations , but not at high dNTPs . For comparison , when the downstream DNA is single-stranded and does not need to be melted , the dNTPs Km is 10\u201320 \u03bcM and the rate of synthesis is \u223c200 nt/s ( Patel et al . , 1991; Stano et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , the dNTPs Km on duplex DNA template is 2\u201310 times higher than on ssDNA template . The minimal mechanism of DNA synthesis contains three steps ( Figure 1F ) . The first step is capture of the templating base ( base-capture ) in the insertion site of the DNAP through translocation ( Poln \u21d4 Poln . base ) , the second step is dNTP binding and base pairing with the templating-base ( Poln . base \u21d4 Poln . base . dNTP ) , and the third step is chemistry where dNMP is added , PPi is released , and the primer-end is elongated by one nucleotide ( Poln . base . dNTP \u21d4 Poln + 1 ) . The rate vs dNTPs dependencies of all GC forks fit well to this ordered three-step mechanism ( Appendix\u2014Section 2 and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) with variable equilibrium constant for the base-capture step ( K1 ) , which we find decreases steadily with increasing GC percentage ( Figure 1G ) . This means that the downstream DNA stability mainly affects the base-capture step , and DNAP is less efficient at capturing the templating-base when the stability of the duplex DNA is higher . However , the nearly GC-independent DNA unwinding kcat indicates that dNTP binding stabilizes the base-captured state and drives DNA unwinding , but higher concentrations of dNTPs are required with higher GC percentage in the downstream DNA . This mechanism of DNAP resembles the mechanism proposed for DNA-dependent RNA polymerases ( Thomen et al . , 2005 ) . The unwinding rates of T7 helicase were measured using the same replication fork substrates , except fluorescein was moved to the end of the leading strand ( to avoid fluorescence changes from helicase binding to the end of the lagging strand ) and a GGG quencher was introduced opposite to the fluorescein in the lagging strand to ensure that the signal is quenched when the DNA is duplexed ( Figure 2A ) . The fork DNA was incubated with T7 helicase in the presence of dTTP without Mg ( II ) to avoid assembly lags , and the unwinding reactions were initiated with Mg ( II ) and dT90 trap DNA . The unwinding kinetics show a presteady state time lag followed by fluorescence increase due to strand separation ( Figure 2B ) . The kinetics were fit to the n-step model , and the average base pair unwinding rates were determined at various dTTP concentrations with all the GC forks ( Figure 2C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06562 . 007Figure 2 .

Fitting kinetics of unwinding by T7 helicase . The dTTP dependency data for unwinding by the helicase on the 20\u201365% GC DNA were fit to the model A ( A ) model B ( B and C ) and model C ( D ) . The data do not fit well to model A . Although it fits reasonably well to model B for the 20% and 35% GC DNA , the 50% and 65% GC DNA data do not fit well to the model .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06562 . 009 Unlike T7 DNAP , the unwinding kcat of the helicase decreases from 65 bp/s to 15 bp/s with increasing GC percentage ( Figure 2D ) , but the dTTP Km remains relatively unchanged and decreases only two-fold from 300 \u03bcM to 160 \u03bcM ( Figure 2E ) . Thus , T7 helicase and T7 DNAP respond differently to increasing GC content , which indicates that their DNA-unwinding mechanisms are fundamentally different . T7 helicase moves on DNA through sequential nucleotide hydrolysis and translocation mechanism , where each subunit of the ring takes turn in binding the incoming nucleotide ( Liao et al . , 2005; Crampton et al . , 2006; Enemark and Joshua-Tor , 2006; Thomsen and Berger , 2009; Patel et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore at any given time , only the leading subunit of T7 helicase binds an incoming dTTP and reels in the nucleotide base from the fork junction ( Sun et al . , 2011 ) . There are three minimal steps during each base pair unwinding event . One , the leading helicase subunit binds to the nucleotide base from the fork junction ( base-capture ) ; two , the leading subunit binds to a molecule of dTTP; and three , dTTP hydrolysis and product release ( 2\u2032-deoxythymidine 5\u2032-diphosphate ( dTDP ) and Pi ) occur at distinct subunits around the hexameric ring ( Figure 2F ) . The order of events at the leading subunit is not known . In other words , it is not known whether base-capture by the leading subunit occurs in the dTTP-bound or dTTP-free state . Therefore , we considered all three models and our kinetic modeling shows that the rate vs dTTP data do not fit to models where dTTP binding and base-capture steps occur in a particular order ( Appendix\u2014Section 3 and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C ) . Instead , the data fit well to the random order mechanism ( Figure 2F and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D ) , wherein base-capture can occur both in the dTTP-free and dTTP-bound states of the leading subunit . We show that the dTTP-bound state is slightly better at capturing the DNA-base than the dTTP-free state ( Figure 2H ) , but the equilibrium constants of the base-capture steps in the dTTP-free ( K1 ) and dTTP-bound ( K2 ) states both decrease with increasing GC percentage ( Figure 2G\u2013H ) , which indicates that the rate of unwinding by the helicase is limited by base pair separation even at high concentrations of dTTP . Our results demonstrate that the DNA-unwinding activity of T7 helicase and T7 DNAP is rate-limited by inefficient base-capture at the fork junction . However , the two enzymes respond differently to increasing GC percentage , and this is because of their different kinetic mechanisms . T7 DNAP follows an ordered mechanism , wherein dNTP binding follows the base-capture step . Therefore , the kinetic outcome of increasing GC content is analogous to a pure competitive mechanism where inhibitor ( GC content ) increases the dNTPs Km without affecting the unwinding kcat . T7 helicase does not follow an ordered mechanism . Consequently , the kinetic outcome of increasing GC content is analogous to a mixed inhibition mechanism where inhibitor ( GC content ) decreases the unwinding kcat and mildly affects the dTTP Km . Therefore , T7 DNAP is able to achieve fast rates of unwinding at high dNTPs , but this is not the case with the helicase , whose unwinding kcat remains suboptimal even at high-dTTP concentrations . We used the same replication fork substrates used in the DNAP experiments to investigate the unwinding mechanism of the combined T7 helicase and T7 DNAP enzymes ( Figure 3A ) . In these experiments , helicase and DNAP were preassembled on the fork DNA using dTTP without Mg ( II ) , and unwinding was initiated with Mg ( II ) , dVTPs ( 3 dNTPs except dTTP ) , and dT90 trap DNA . The kinetic traces show an initial lag followed by an increase in fluorescence , but then a slight dip at the end of the reaction ( Figure 3A ) . The dip is more prominent with high-GC content forks than with the low-GC content forks ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . The dip was observed with the isolated helicase and with helicase-DNAP functioning together ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) , but not with isolated DNAP . Therefore , we believe that the dip comes from interactions of the helicase with the fluorescein at the end of the lagging strand . We fit the lag and the increase in fluorescence to the n-step model to obtain the average base pair unwinding rates . These unwinding rates correlate well with the rates from the gel-based primer-extension assays ( Pandey and Patel , 2014 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06562 . 010Figure 3 .

The dip in signal is more prominent with the 50% GC DNA substrate compared to the 20% GC DNA substrate . This suggests that the first and second phase could represent the coupled and uncoupled activities of the helicase-DNAP , respectively . ( B ) Representative trace showing time course of unwinding by the helicase at 500 \u03bcM dTTP on the 20% GC DNA . The presence of the dip in the helicase only reaction suggests that interaction of helicase with the fluorescein leads to a dip in the fluorescence signal once the strands are unwound . Together , these data indicate that the dip in the fluorescence signal could be due to ( i ) helicase interaction with the fluorescein and ( ii ) coupled and uncoupled activities of the helicase-DNAP . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06562 . 011 The unwinding rates of the combined enzymes measured at increasing dTTP and constant dVTPs concentration show little dependency on the GC percentage ( Figure 3B ) . The unwinding kcat is \u223c90 bp/s when GC percentage is low , and kcat decreases minimally to 70 bp/s when GC percentage is high . Similarly , the dTTP Km changes little from 120 to 90 \u03bcM as GC percentage increases ( Figure 3C\u2013D ) . This indicates that the DNA-unwinding rates of the combined enzymes are not rate-limited by base pair separation at any dNTPs concentrations . Additionally , these results also show that the two enzymes mutually stimulate the activities of unwinding and synthesis . How does T7 DNAP stimulate the helicase ? The dTTP Km of the isolated helicase on the 50% GC fork is \u223c160 \u03bcM , which decreases to \u223c80 \u03bcM in the presence of T7 DNAP ( Figure 3E ) , which is close to the dTTP Km on ssDNA ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Similarly , the unwinding kcat of the isolated helicase is \u223c20 bp/s and increases substantially to \u223c150 bp/s in the presence of T7 DNAP ( Figure 3F ) , which is close to the translocation rate of the helicase on ssDNA ( \u223c130 nt/s ) ( Kim et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , T7 DNAP stimulates T7 helicase by increasing the DNA-unwinding kcat and by slightly decreasing the dTTP Km . The kinetic parameters of T7 helicase coupled to T7 DNAP resemble those of helicase translocating on ssDNA rather than unwinding duplex DNA . How does the helicase stimulate the DNAP ? The unwinding kcat ( with SSB ) is 160 bp/s and decreases minimally to 140 bp/s in the presence of T7 helicase , whereas the dNTPs Km decreases by 24-fold from \u223c120 \u03bcM ( with SSB ) to 5 \u00b5M in the presence of T7 helicase ( Figure 3G ) . The 5 \u03bcM dNTPs Km is slightly lower than the DNAP's dNTP Km on ssDNA template ( \u223c10\u201320 \u03bcM ) ( Patel et al . , 1991; Stano et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , T7 helicase stimulates T7 DNAP by promoting dNTP binding , and in the presence of helicase , T7 DNAP behaves like a motor translocating on ssDNA template . In summary , by measuring the unwinding kinetics of the individual enzymes and comparing it to the combined enzymes , we determine how T7 helicase and T7 DNAP mutually stimulate each other's activity . The T7 DNAP stimulates the T7 helicase by increasing the unwinding kcat , whereas the helicase stimulates the DNAP by decreasing the dNTPs Km . When functioning independently , the lower kcat of the helicase and higher dNTPs Km of DNAP are due to inefficient capture of the nucleotide base from the fork junction . This implies that the two enzymes help each other by increasing the efficiency of the base-capture step . What happens when one enzyme is faster than the other enzyme during leading strand synthesis ? Do the enzymes become functionally uncoupled ? Does the faster enzyme outrun the slower enzyme ? Because T7 helicase mainly uses dTTP as its substrate and the DNAP uses all dNTPs , we can change the concentrations of dTTP and dVTPs to control the speeds of helicase and DNAP , respectively . When the helicase rate is decreased by lowering dTTP , DNA unwinding slows down ( Figure 4A ) . At 500 \u03bcM dTTP , the kcat of the combined enzymes is fast ( 150 bp/s ) , but at 50 \u03bcM dTTP , the kcat is 60 bp/s . This implies that when helicase is slower than DNAP , the DNAP will not outrun the helicase . Interestingly , the dVTPs Km of the combined enzymes remains unchanged at \u223c5 \u03bcM , both at low- and high-dTTP concentrations . This means that when helicase is slower than DNAP , the combined enzymes remain functionally coupled . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06562 . 012Figure 4 . Functionally coupled and uncoupled helicase-DNAP . ( A ) The unwinding rates of the combined helicase-DNAP were measured at 50 \u00b5M dTTP ( red circle ) or 500 \u00b5M dTTP ( green circle ) at increasing dVTPs concentration on the 50% GC fork . The bar chart shows the unwinding kcat and dVTPs Km of the combined enzymes at low- ( grey bars ) and high-dTTP ( black bars ) concentrations . The cartoon shows that the enzymes remain functionally coupled when helicase is the slow motor . ( B ) The unwinding rates of the combined enzymes ( green circles ) at zero dVTPs concentration are compared to the rates of helicase alone ( red circles ) at increasing dTTP concentrations on the 50% GC fork . The bar charts compare the unwinding kcat and dTTP Km of helicase-DNAP ( black ) and isolated helicase ( gray ) . Error bars represent fitting errors . The cartoon show that stalling DNAP leads to functional uncoupling between helicase-DNAP with or without physical uncoupling . ( C ) The DNA unwinding rates of the isolated helicase and helicase-DNAP were measured at 1 mM dTTP and 0 . 5 \u00b5M dVTPs on the 20% GC fork . The bar chart shows the unwinding rate of the isolated helicase ( light gray ) , helicase-DNAP complex ( dark gray ) , and the predicted rate of DNA synthesis by helicase-DNAP assuming coupled synthesis ( black ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06562 . 012 When DNAP cannot move forward due to lack of dNTPs , the associated helicase unwinds the replication fork with unstimulated rates ( Figure 4B ) . This means that the stalled DNAP does not pull the helicase back or prevent it from unwinding the DNA . With stalled DNAP , the unwinding rate of the 50% GC fork is 20 bp/s , which is similar to the rate of helicase functioning independently ( 18 bp/s ) . Similarly , with the stalled DNAP , the dTTP Km of the helicase is ~130 \u03bcM , which is similar to the dTTP Km in the absence of DNAP ( ~160 \u03bcM ) ( Figure 4B ) . Thus , stalling the DNAP functionally uncouples the helicase . When dVTPs concentrations are low ( 0 . 5 \u03bcM ) , the unwinding rate with the combined enzymes is similar to that of the isolated helicase ( Figure 4C ) . This indicates that when T7 DNAP is slow , the helicase is capable of moving faster and can outrun the DNAP . The functional data presented above indicate that the two enzymes help each other by increasing the base-capture efficiency . To understand the structural basis for the mutual stimulation of helicase and DNAP , we used 2-AP as a probe to monitor base pair melting . When 2-AP is base-paired ( Figure 5A ) , it has a low-fluorescence intensity , but when 2-AP:T base pair is melted and the 2-AP base is unstacked , the fluorescence increases ( Ward et al . , 1969 ) . Such changes in 2-AP fluorescence successfully monitor base unstacking and base pair separation in a variety of enzyme studies , including replication enzymes ( Reha-Krantz , 2009; Jose et al . , 2012 ) . However , there are no studies using this method to investigate base pair melting of downstream duplex DNA by replicative DNAPs or the helicase-DNAP complex . By systematically labeling the replication fork DNA with a single 2-AP probe at different positions near the fork junction ( Figure 5B ) , we are able to determine the base pair melting footprint of the individual and combined enzymes and deduce the precise positions of the helicase and DNAP at the replication fork . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06562 . 013Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06562 . 018 The crystal structure of T7 DNAP ( Doublie et al . , 1998 ) shows interactions with two template-bases ( N + 1 and N + 2 ) immediately downstream of the primer-end at positon N and \u223c90o bend between N + 1 and N + 2 template-bases ( Figure 5C ) . Thus , introducing a 2-AP at N + 1 results in a significant increase in fluorescence consistent with unstacking of the N + 1 base from bending of the template DNA ( Figure 5D ) . However , there is no increase in fluorescence of 2-AP at N + 2 and a decrease is observed at N + 3 ( Figure 5D ) , which is consistent with interactions of these template DNA-bases with the amino acids in the template-binding pocket of T7 DNAP ( Doublie et al . , 1998 ) . The change in 2-AP fluorescence at positions N + 4 and N + 5 is minimal upon DNAP binding , which indicates that T7 DNAP may not interact with these downstream positions . Thus , T7 DNAP influences only three template-bases immediately downstream from the primer-end . Experiments with 2-AP at N + 1 to N + 3 positions on the leading strand show that T7 DNAP makes similar interactions with the template-bases in replication fork substrates ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . To determine if T7 DNAP unwinds the duplex DNA downstream of the primer-end , we introduced 2-AP at various positions in the lagging strand in the replication fork substrates . The fluorescence intensity increases upon adding T7 DNAP when 2-AP is at the N + 1 , N + 2 , or N + 3 base pair , but not at N + 4 ( Figure 5E\u2013H\u2014Green bars ) . Similarly , when 2-AP is at N + 2 and is part of the fork junction , addition of T7 DNAP increases the fluorescence ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . However , when 2-AP is at N + 3 and is part of the fork junction , no increase in fluorescence is observed ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B ) , which indicates that T7 DNAP does not melt the junction base pair three nucleotides downstream from the primer-end . The increase in 2-AP intensity at N + 3 in the internal position ( Figure 5G ) is due to N + 2 base unstacking and not from unstacking of the N + 3 base . Taken together , these results indicate that T7 DNAP binds to three template-bases downstream of primer-end and melts two base pairs . When 2-AP experiments with T7 DNAP were carried out with E . coli SSB , the fluorescence intensity changes were much larger , although SSB by itself did not increase the 2-AP fluorescence significantly ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . These results indicate that T7 DNAP on its own only partially melts the junction base pairs . Furthermore , these base pairs appear to be in dynamic equilibrium ( closed \u2194 open ) , because SSB can shift the equilibrium towards the open state by simply binding to ssDNA . This provides direct proof that T7 DNAP can melt the junction base pair , but DNAP is not efficient at preventing base pair reannealing; thus , SSB stimulates the activity of DNAP by trapping the unwound bases . The 2-AP experiments with T7 helicase were carried out in the presence of dTMPPCP , the non-hydrolyzable dTTP analog , which does not support translocation or processive DNA unwinding , but is needed for hexamer formation and DNA binding ( Hingorani and Patel , 1993 ) . T7 helicase does not change the fluorescence intensity of 2-AP in ssDNA ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4B ) . However , T7 helicase increases the fluorescence of 2-AP at the fork junction , but not the second base pair from the junction , irrespective of the gap size between the primer end and fork junction ( Figure 5E\u2013H\u2014Red bars ) . Thus , unlike T7 DNAP that melts two base pairs upon binding to the replication fork substrate , T7 helicase melts only the junction base pair . However , T7 helicase melts the junction base pair even when the primer-end is separated from the fork junction by more than one nucleotide ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5A\u2013C compare to Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . These results indicate that T7 helicase follows the fork junction and is not influenced by the position of the primer-end . Interestingly , SSB has no effect on the helicase catalyzed melting of the fork junction ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5D ) . This is consistent with the observation that SSB does not stimulate the unwinding rates of the helicase ( Donmez and Patel , 2008 ) . To investigate the effect of T7 DNAP and T7 helicase together on junction base pair melting , we measured 2-AP fluorescence after sequential addition of helicase and DNAP to the fork DNA in that order and the reverse order ( Figure 5E\u2013H\u2014light blue bars ) . The combined enzymes show a much larger increase in fluorescence intensity with 2-AP at N + 1 , N + 2 , or N + 3 base pairs , but not at N + 4 . As shown earlier with the DNAP , the increase in N + 3 is due to N + 2 base unstacking; therefore , the results indicate that the combined enzymes melt two base pairs downstream from the primer-end , just like T7 DNAP , but more efficiently . The 2-AP fluorescence intensity at steady state measures the equilibrium distribution of melted and annealed states of the junction base-pair . The small increase in fluorescence intensity with the isolated helicase and DNAP suggests that each enzyme shifts the equilibrium only moderately to the base-pair melted state . On the other hand , the striking increase in fluorescence intensity with the combined enzymes indicates that together the two enzymes shift the equilibrium strongly toward the base-pair melted state . Interestingly , the combined effect of helicase and DNAP on base pairs melting is greater than the sum , which indicates synergism in DNA melting . This synergism depends on the number of nucleotides between the primer-end and fork junction . Synergistic melting of the base pair is observed only when there is no gap or one nucleotide gap between the primer-end ( DNAP-binding site ) and fork junction ( helicase-binding site ) ( Figure 5E\u2013G ) . Synergistic melting is not observed when there are two nucleotides between the primer-end and fork junction ( Figure 5H ) . The results also demonstrate that a replication fork with two ssDNA template-bases between the primer-end and fork junction can stably accommodate both enzymes of the T7 replisome . Therefore , this study defines the specific positions of helicase and DNAP at the replication fork junction with single-base resolution to create a structural model of the replisome ( Figure 6 ) that forms the basis for understanding how the helicase and DNAP mutually stimulate each other's activities as discussed below . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06562 . 019Figure 6 . Proposed model of DNA unwinding-synthesis by T7 replisome . The top cartoon of T7 replisome results after melting of the N + 2 base pair by helicase and DNAP . There are two unwound nucleotides ( N + 1 and N + 2 ) between the primer-end and fork junction at N + 3 . The N + 1 base of the leading strand is bound in the insertion site and serves as the templating nucleotide for the incoming dNTP , and the N + 2 is unstacked and bound in the template-binding channel of the DNAP . The complementary N + 1 and N + 2 nucleotides ( as well as N and N \u2212 1 ) on the lagging strand are bound to individual subunits of the helicase hexamer , as shown . Stable binding to N + 2 base by the helicase triggers dTTP hydrolysis and products release at different subunits of the ring . The helicase subunit at the leading edge has weak interactions with the partially unwound N + 3 junction base ( dotted line ) , which gets stabilized after the next round of catalysis . When N is elongated by one nucleotide , the N + 2 moves into the insertion site after PPi release , and the helicase and DNAP cooperatively melt the N + 3 junction base pair , as shown in the bottom cartoon . This model explains the one-nucleotide step size where the combined enzymes translocate by one nucleotide for every dTTP hydrolyzed and nucleotide incorporated ( Pandey and Patel , 2014 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06562 . 019 \n When DNAP is in the post-translocated state , the N + 1 templating base ( blue ) is positioned in the polymerase active site ready to base pair with the incoming dNTP ( Figure 6 , upper cartoon ) . After the chemical step , the DNAP translocates downstream by one nucleotide to position the next templating-base N + 2 ( red ) in the active site ( Figure 6 , lower cartoon ) . This forward translocation step is coupled to unwinding of the N + 3 junction base pair ( green ) . Based on our results , we propose that the DNAP by itself is not efficient at preventing junction base pair reannealing , and this unfavorable equilibrium constant for DNA melting destabilizes the post-translocated state of DNAP and competes with incoming dNTP binding . When helicase is present at the fork junction , it helps both unwind and trap the junction bases . Thus , the associated helicase stimulates dNTP binding by stabilizing the post-translocated state of T7 DNAP , and the outcome is decrease in dNTPs Km . The helicase by itself is not efficient at unwinding the fork junction . However , the associated DNAP by providing an unwound base to the helicase at the fork junction facilitates the base-capture step and drives the reactions of dTTP binding-hydrolysis-product release around the helicase ring , and the outcome is an increase in the unwinding kcat . The combined binding energy of the two enzymes bound to opposite strands is sufficient to keep the unwound bases from reannealing , explaining the fast and GC-independent unwinding rates of helicase-DNAP . Interestingly , cooperative and enhanced efficiency of base pair melting is observed only when the helicase and DNAP are within one nucleotide distance from each other . In most cases , helicase is coupled physically to the DNAP , either directly as in the case of T7 replication system or indirectly through accessory proteins ( Kim et al . , 1996; Hamdan et al . , 2007; Gambus et al . , 2009; Sengupta et al . , 2013 ) . Some of these interactions aid in the assembly of the replisome ( Zhang et al . , 2011 ) and perhaps in proper positioning of the helicase with the DNAP in the replisome , but the consequences of breaking physical interactions on synergistic melting need to be investigated . One can imagine situations where flexible positioning is needed when one or the other enzyme pauses or stalls during leading strand synthesis . Our investigation of such situations reveals that when DNAP stalls or is the slower motor , the helicase becomes functionally uncoupled and outruns the DNAP by unwinding the replication fork at the unstimulated rates . Similar behaviors were observed in other replisome studies as well ( Byun et al . , 2005; McInerney and O'Donnell , 2007 ) . Whether the functionally uncoupled helicase remains physically coupled to the DNAP remains unknown . Interestingly , when the helicase slows down , the two enzymes remain functionally coupled as evident from the low dNTPs Km and that the DNAP does not outrun the helicase . In this case , the combined enzymes unwind the DNA with the stimulated rate of the helicase . Although SSB stimulates base pair melting by T7 DNAP , our studies find that the unwinding rates of T7 DNAP with SSB remain GC-sensitive at low-dNTPs concentrations . We propose that this is because SSB cannot trap the junction bases coordinately with DNA synthesis in the manner that T7 helicase does during leading strand synthesis . Similarly , it has been shown previously that SSB does not increase the unwinding rates of T7 helicase , which remain GC sensitive at all concentrations of dTTP ( Donmez and Patel , 2008 ) . These observations indicate that simply trapping the displaced strand by DNA binding is not sufficient , but coordination between the steps of junction base pair unwinding/trapping and synthesis is needed for rate acceleration . The replicative helicase is a central player in coordinating leading and lagging strand synthesis ( Pandey et al . , 2009 ) . The interdependency between helicase and DNAP assures that the DNA is not unwound in an uncoupled manner leading to disruption in the coordinated synthesis of the two strands . The mechanism of DNAP is conserved in all organisms where DNAPs elongate the primer in the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 direction . On the other hand , replicative helicases of the prokaryotes and phages unwind DNA in the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 direction , whereas those of eukaryotes unwind DNA in the opposite 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 direction . Our studies suggest that the leading edges of the T7 helicase and T7 DNAP are close together at the fork junction and this conformation is important for functional coupling of unwinding and synthesis reactions and preventing DNA reannealing . This model of the replication fork is likely to be generally applicable to replisomes of prokaryotes as most show functional coupling between helicase and DNAP ( Patel et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast to prokaryotic replisomes , the replicative helicase of eukaryotes and archaea binds to the same strand as the DNAP ( O'Donnell et al . , 2013 ) . In this case , both helicase and DNAP cannot be close to the fork junction , and there must be other mechanisms to functionally couple the two activities and prevent junction base pair reannealing . It is possible that although the MCM2-7 helicase encircles the leading strand , other subunits in the CMG ( Cdc45-MCM2-7-GINS ) complex may interact with the lagging strand and this could be a mechanism for preventing DNA reannealing at the fork junction ( Costa et al . , 2014 ) . \n Oligodeoxynucleotides labeled with fluorescein ( FAM ) on the 3\u2032-end and BHQ1 on the 5\u2032-end were purchased from Biosearch Technologies and RP-HPLC purified ( Novato , CA ) . Oligodeoxynucleotides labeled with fluorescein on the 5\u2032-end , 2-AP labeled and unlabeled oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies ( Coralville , IA ) . These DNAs were gel-purified and extracted from the gel by electroelution ( Whatman Schleicher & Schuell ) . Replication fork substrates were created by heating the appropriate DNA strands to 95\u00b0C for 5 min and slowly cooling to room temperature . The DNA sequences are provided in Supplementary file 1 . T7 helicase ( gp4A\u2032 ) , T7 gp5 exo- , and E . coli SSB were purified as described ( Lohman et al . , 1986; Patel et al . , 1991 , 1992; Kim et al . , 1992 ) . Thioredoxin was purchased from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO ) . The unwinding assays were carried out at 18\u00b0C in a stopped-flow instrument ( Kintek Corp , Austin , TX ) with excitation at 480 nm and fluorescence emission using a long pass 515 nm cut-off filter . Reaction buffer A for the helicase and helicase-DNAP experiments contained 50 mM Tris acetate , pH 7 . 6 , 50 mM potassium glutamate , 1 . 5 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , 5 mM Dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 10 mM total Mg ( II ) . For the helicase assays , a mixture of fork DNA , T7 helicase , dTTP , and EDTA from syringe A was mixed with Mg ( II ) , dVTPs ( dCTP , dGTP , and dATP ) , and dT90 trap from syringe B to initiate the reaction . The reactions with the combined enzymes were carried out similarly except syringe A contained T7 DNAP . For the T7 DNAP-unwinding assays , a mixture of fork DNA , T7 DNAP , and E . coli SSB ( pre-incubated at 18\u00b0C for 10 min ) from syringe A was mixed with Mg ( II ) and dNTPs from syringe B to initiate the reaction . Reaction buffer B for the DNAP reactions contained 50 mM Tris Cl , pH 7 . 6 , 40 mM NaCl , 1 . 5 mM EDTA , 5 mM DTT , 8 . 1\u20138 . 5 mM free Mg ( II ) ( MgCl2 ) . Reaction buffer B was used in the T7 DNAP-unwinding assays as SSB was observed to precipitate in buffer A . The final concentrations of enzymes and DNA were 10 nM fork DNA , 20 nM T7 helicase hexamer , 20 nM T7 DNAP , 200 nM E . coli SSB , and 2 \u03bcM dT90 trap DNA . The equilibrium fluorescence experiments were carried out on FluoroMax 4 ( Horiba Join Yvon Inc ) . The sample was excited at 315 nm ( 2 mm slit width ) , and emission was measured at 370 nm ( 6 mm slit width ) . The buffer contained 50 mM Tris Cl pH 7 . 6 , 40 mM NaCl , 10 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM DTT . The observed fluorescence was corrected for buffer and protein bound to unlabeled replication fork substrate . The proteins absorb minimally at the emission wavelength , and hence , the inner filter effect was negligible . The experiments were carried out with 100 nM DNA , 200 nM T7 helicase ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 1B , 2A ) , 200 nM T7 DNAP/thioredoxin ( 2 . 5 times excess thioredoxin ) ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) , and 10 \u03bcM dTMP-PCP at 25\u00b0C . A sample trace showing the effect of DNAP and helicase binding to a 2-AP DNA substrate is shown in Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 1C , 2C . The DNA unwinding kinetics were fit to the n-step model ( Ali and Lohman , 1997 ) using gfit and model [unwinding . m] in MATLAB with Optimization toolbox ( The MathWorks , Inc . , Natick , MA ) ( Levin et al . , 2009 ) . Unwinding is modeled as a multistep process with equal step-size ( s ) and rate constant ( ki ) that are estimated from fittings as described previously ( Pandey et al . , 2010 ) . More information about the fitting is provided in the Appendix\u2014Methods section . The average unwinding rates were plotted against dNTP concentration and fit to the hyperbolic equation to obtain kcat and Km values . ( 1 ) unwinding\u2009rate=\u2009kcat\u2217[dNTP]Km+[dNTP] ."}

A hormone called GnRH , which stands for gonadotropin-releasing hormone , plays a major role in regulating this balance . GnRH is transmitted from the brain and stimulates the release of other hormones from a nearby gland called the pituitary gland , which , in turn , activates the reproductive organs to produce steroid hormones , such as estrogen . Steroids do many things in the body , including regulating the release of GnRH and pituitary hormones through a process called feedback . In the case of negative feedback , steroids maintain the release of GnRH and pituitary hormone within a normal range . Once per reproductive cycle , estrogen will instead positively feed back into the system and activate GnRH , causing pituitary hormone levels to spike , and initiate the release of one or more eggs from the ovary by a process known as ovulation . The neurons that make GnRH do not directly respond to estrogen , but instead receive input from different upstream neurons that contain estrogen receptors . However , it is poorly understood how fertility is regulated by these neurons . To investigate the effects of estrogen on these upstream neurons , Wang et al . genetically removed the estrogen receptors from two separate populations of neurons in mice . Estrogen was found to affect each of these populations differently , inhibiting one and activating the other . Wang et al . showed that these two populations likely have different roles in reproduction: the population inhibited by estrogen regulates negative feedback and generates reproductive cycles , whilst the population activated by estrogen regulates positive feedback and stimulates ovulation . This knowledge furthers our understanding of how the brain regulates fertility , and the genetic approach used to remove the estrogen receptor could be applied to the study of other hormones that act on the brain .", "source": "The brain regulates fertility through gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) neurons . Estradiol induces negative feedback on pulsatile GnRH/luteinizing hormone ( LH ) release and positive feedback generating preovulatory GnRH/LH surges . Negative and positive feedbacks are postulated to be mediated by kisspeptin neurons in arcuate and anteroventral periventricular ( AVPV ) nuclei , respectively . Kisspeptin-specific ER\u03b1 knockout mice exhibit disrupted LH pulses and surges . This knockout approach is neither location-specific nor temporally controlled . We utilized CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt ER\u03b1 in adulthood . Mice with ER\u03b1 disruption in AVPV kisspeptin neurons have typical reproductive cycles but blunted LH surges , associated with decreased excitability of these neurons . Mice with ER\u03b1 knocked down in arcuate kisspeptin neurons showed disrupted cyclicity , associated with increased glutamatergic transmission to these neurons . These observations suggest that activational effects of estradiol regulate surge generation and maintain cyclicity through AVPV and arcuate kisspeptin neurons , respectively , independent from its role in the development of hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons or puberty onset . \n Infertility is a common clinical problem affecting 15% of couples; ovulatory disorders account for 25% of this total ( Macaluso et al . , 2010 ) . The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis controls reproduction and malfunction of this axis can cause ovulatory dysfunction and/or other disturbances of the reproductive cycle ( Helm et al . , 2009; Plant and Zeleznik , 2015 ) . Gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) neurons form the final common pathway for central neural regulation of reproduction . GnRH stimulates the pituitary to secrete follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , which regulate gonadal steroid and gamete production . Estradiol , via estrogen receptor alpha ( ER\u03b1 ) , plays crucial roles in both homeostatic negative feedback and positive feedback action on GnRH/LH release in females ( D\u00f6cke and D\u00f6rner , 1965; Moenter et al . , 1990; Lubahn et al . , 1993; Krege et al . , 1998; Wintermantel et al . , 2006; Christian et al . , 2008; Glanowska et al . , 2012; Cheong et al . , 2015 ) . Low estradiol levels suppress pulsatile GnRH/LH release , whereas sustained elevations in estradiol during the late follicular phase of the cycle cause a switch of estradiol feedback action from negative to positive , inducing prolonged GnRH/LH surges , which ultimately triggers ovulation ( Christian and Moenter , 2010 ) . As GnRH neurons typically do not express detectable ER\u03b1 ( Hrabovszky et al . , 2001 ) , estradiol feedback is likely transmitted to GnRH neurons by ER\u03b1-expressing afferents . Kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate and anteroventral periventricular ( AVPV ) regions are estradiolsensitive GnRH afferents that are postulated to mediate estradiol negative and positive feedback , respectively ( Oakley et al . , 2009; Lehman et al . , 2010 ) . Kisspeptin potently stimulates GnRH neurons and Kiss1 mRNA is differentially regulated in these nuclei by estradiol ( Han et al . , 2005; Messager et al . , 2005; Smith et al . , 2005; Pielecka-Fortuna et al . , 2008; Lehman et al . , 2010; Kumar et al . , 2015; Yip et al . , 2015 ) . ER\u03b1 in kisspeptin cells is critical for estradiol negative and positive feedback , as kisspeptin-specific ER\u03b1 knockout ( KERKO ) mice exhibit higher frequency LH pulses and fail to exhibit estradiol-induced LH surges ( Mayer et al . , 2010; Dubois et al . , 2015; Greenwald-Yarnell et al . , 2016; Wang et al . , 2018 ) . Although informative , the KERKO model has several caveats that limit interpretation . First , ER\u03b1 is deleted as soon as Kiss1 is expressed , before birth in arcuate kisspeptin neurons ( also called KNDy neurons for coexpression of kisspeptin , neurokinin B and dynorphin ) and before puberty in AVPV kisspeptin neurons ( Semaan et al . , 2010; Kumar et al . , 2014 ) . This may cause developmental changes in these cells and/or their networks . Second , ER\u03b1 is deleted from all kisspeptin cells , thus making it impossible to assess independently the role of AVPV and arcuate kisspeptin neurons . Combining CRISPR-Cas9 with targeted viral vector injection allows deletion of ER\u03b1 in a nucleus-specific and temporally-controlled manner to address the above caveats ( Swiech et al . , 2015 ) . We designed Cre-dependent AAV vectors that carry single guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) that target Esr1 ( encoding ER\u03b1 ) or lacZ and delivered these vectors to the AVPV or arcuate of adult female mice that express Cas9 in kisspeptin cells . We then compared the reproductive phenotypes as well as kisspeptin neuronal physiology in AAV-Esr1 vs AAV-lacZ targeted mice and KERKO mice . \n We first used extracellular recordings to monitor the spontaneous firing rate of YFP-identified AVPV kisspeptin neurons in coronal brain slices from ovary-intact control and KERKO mice . As the persistent cornified vaginal cytology of KERKO mice is similar to that observed during estrus ( Greenwald-Yarnell et al . , 2016 ) , we used mice in the estrous stage of the reproductive cycle as controls . The firing frequency of AVPV kisspeptin neurons was lower in ovary-intact KERKO mice compared to controls ( Figure 1a , b , two-way ANOVA/Holm-Sidak , p=0 . 0001 ) . To test if the firing rate of AVPV kisspeptin neurons in KERKO mice responds to circulating estradiol , we repeated this study in ovariectomized ( OVX ) mice and OVX mice with an estradiol implant producing constant physiologic levels ( OVX\u00a0+\u00a0E ) ( Christian et al . , 2005 ) . OVX reduced and estradiol treatment increased firing rate in cells from control , but not KERKO , mice ( Figure 1a , b two-way ANOVA/Holm-Sidak , control intact vs OVX p=0 . 009 , intact vs OVX\u00a0+\u00a0E , p=0 . 02 , OVX vs OVX\u00a0+\u00a0E , p<0 . 0001 ) . As a result of this difference , the firing frequency is higher in cells from OVX\u00a0+\u00a0E control than OVX\u00a0+\u00a0E KERKO mice ( p<0 . 0001 ) . Statistical test parameters for all figures are in Tables 1 and 2 . We next recorded the whole-cell firing signatures of neurons in these six groups in response to current injection . AVPV kisspeptin neurons in control mice mice exhibit a greater number of depolarization-induced bursts ( DIB ) and rebound bursts when estradiol is elevated , confirming previous observations ( Wang et al . , 2016 ) ( Figure 1c , d , e , Chi-square , DIB , p=0 . 02; rebound , p=0 . 02; Fisher\u2019s exact post\u00a0hoc test , DIB , OVX vs OVX\u00a0+E , p=0 . 008 , rebound OVX vs OVX\u00a0+E p=0 . 03 , for other paired comparisons , p>0 . 2 ) . In KERKO mice , these two types of bursts were rare ( <25% of cells ) in all steroid conditions tested and were not regulated by estradiol ( Figure 1c , d , e , Chi-square , DIB , p=0 . 4 , rebound , p=0 . 3 ) . We also compared the action potential output of these cells in response to current injection ( 0\u201350 pA , 10 pA increments , 500 ms ) . Cells from ovary-intact KERKO mice generated fewer action potentials compared to controls . Action potential generation as a function of current injection was similar in cells from OVX control and OVX KERKO mice but was increased by estradiol only in control mice ( Figure 1f , two-way repeated-measures ANOVA/Holm-Sidak , intact , 20 pA , p=0 . 03 , 30 pA , p=0 . 06; OVX\u00a0+E , 20 pA to 50 pA , p\u22640 . 04 ) . Reduced action potential firing of AVPV kisspeptin neurons from KERKO mice may be attributable at least in part to decreased input resistance compared to controls ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 , two-way ANOVA/Holm-Sidak control vs KERKO , intact , p=0 . 006 , OVX , p=0 . 7 , OVX\u00a0+E p=0 . 02 ) . As both depolarization-induced bursts and rebound bursts are sensitive to NiCl ( 100 \u00b5M ) ( Lee et al . , 1999 ) at levels that fairly specifically block T-type calcium channels , we measured T-type ( IT ) current density and voltage dependence . IT current density was decreased in AVPV kisspeptin cells from gonad-intact KERKO mice compared to controls ( Figure 2a , b , two-way repeated-measures ANOVA/Holm-Sidak , \u221250 mV , p=0 . 003; \u221240 mV , p=0 . 002; \u221230 mV , p=0 . 003 ) . The voltage dependence of activation was not different between groups , but the voltage dependence of inactivation was depolarized in cells from KERKO mice ( Figure 2c , control vs KERKO , two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-test , V1/2 activation \u221252 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 . 6 vs \u221248 . 6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 . 4 mV , p>0 . 1; slope 5 . 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 6 vs 5 . 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 7 , p>0 . 1; V1/2 inactivation \u221274 . 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 . 1 vs \u221261 . 9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 . 1 mV , p=0 . 03; slope \u22123 . 1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 5 vs \u22124 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 3 , p=0 . 1 ) . A caveat of studying the role of ER\u03b1 in AVPV kisspeptin neurons using KERKO mice is that the deletion of ER\u03b1 ( encoded by Esr1 ) using cre recombinase under the control of the kisspeptin promoter is neither time- nor location-specific . We utilized the CRIPSR-Cas9 approach to achieve temporal and spatial control of Esr1 gene knockdown . Two sgRNAs were designed that target exon1 of Esr1 based on software prediction ( Ran et al . , 2013 ) ; sites predicted by FengZhang\u2019s guide design software ( http://crispr . mit . edu ) as possible off-target regions for binding of these guides are listed in Table 3 . The efficiency of each guide\u00a0was tested in vitro in C2C12 mouse myoblast cells ( Milanesi et al . , 2008 ) . The sgRNAs that target Esr1 and a sgRNA that targets lacZ as a control were subcloned into the lentiCRISPRv2 plasmid ( Sanjana et al . , 2014 ) , from which Cas9 and the sgRNA are expressed after transfection of C2C12 cells . Puromycin was used to select construct-expressing cells . After a\u00a0~\u00a04-week selection period , DNA was harvested and the Esr1 region sequenced . Cells expressing either of the sgRNAs targeting Esr1 , but not lacZ , exhibited a peak-on-peak sequencing pattern , indicating disruption of the gene ( Figure 3a ) . As these in vitro experiments suggested these sgRNAs were able to mutate Esr1 , we designed Cre-dependent AAV vectors to express each sgRNA and mCherry ( to indicate infected cells ) under control of the U6 promoter ( Figure 3b ) . The AAV vector was bilaterally stereotaxically injected into the AVPV region of adult female mice that express Cas9 and GFP under control of the kisspeptin promoter ( Kiss1-Cre; Cas9 loxp-stop-Gfp , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) ; these groups are referred to as AVPV-AAV-Esr1 or AVPV-AAV-lacZ . Only one guide was injected per animal to allow comparison of phenotypes when different areas of Esr1 were targeted . The ER\u03b1 knockdown efficiency of the two sgRNAs target Esr1 was comparable . The infection rate for AVPV-AAV-Esr1 was 81 \u00b1 4% ( Figure 3d , Esr1-guide 1 [g1] 82 \u00b1 2% , n\u00a0=\u00a03; Esr1-guide 2 [g2] 81 \u00b1 8% , n\u00a0=\u00a03 ) and only 28 \u00b1 1% of AVPV kisspeptin cells expressed ER\u03b1 post infection ( Figure 3d , n\u00a0=\u00a03 , Esr1-guide1 27 \u00b1 0 . 4%; n\u00a0=\u00a03 , Esr1-guide2 28 \u00b1 2% ) . In mice that received AVPV-AAV-lacZ ( n\u00a0=\u00a03 ) , the infection rate was comparable at 82 \u00b1 2% , but there was no disruption of ER\u03b1; 72 \u00b1 2% of AVPV kisspeptin neurons expressed ER\u03b1 , which is similar to control mice ( Kumar et al . , 2015 ) . Of note , the ER\u03b1 antibody used recognizes the C-terminus , suggesting a lack of rare splice variants that were generated at low levels in initial ERKO mice ( Couse et al . , 1995 ) . We monitored the reproductive cycles of the mice injected with AAV-sgRNAs in the AVPV 12 days before and for up to eight weeks following surgery . Neither AVPV-AAV-Esr1 guide ( tested independently ) nor the AVPV-AAV-lacZ disrupted reproductive cyclicity ( Figure 3e ) , even in mice with a high rate of bilateral infection ( ~80% ) . These mice entered proestrus at the same frequency in the last four weeks compared to the first four weeks ( two weeks pre-surgery plus the first two weeks post-surgery , two-way repeated-measures ANOVA/Holm-Sidak , before vs after; g1 , n\u00a0=\u00a03 , 1 . 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 1 vs 1 . 6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 1; g2 , n\u00a0=\u00a04 , 1 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 1 1 . 4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 1; lacZ n\u00a0=\u00a04 , 1 . 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 2 vs 1 . 3\u00b10 . 1 , p>0 . 1 for each paired comparison ) . To test for the occurrence of estradiol-positive feedback , we monitored both proestrous ( preovulatory ) and estradiol-induced LH surges in these mice . Surge data were similar for guide 1 and guide 2 and data from both guides were combined for group comparisons . Both proestrous and estradiol-induced LH surges were blunted after ER\u03b1 knockdown ( Figure 3f , g , two-way repeated-measures ANOVA/Holm-Sidak; f , lacZ , 3pm vs 5pm , p=0 . 04; lacZ vs Esr1 , 4pm , p=0 . 006 , 5pm , p<0 . 0001 , h , lacZ AM vs PM , p<0 . 0001 ) . There were fewer corpra lutea ( CL ) in mice with Esr1 guides targeted to the AVPV ( p<0 . 05 , guides 1 and 2 combined n\u00a0=\u00a06 , 5 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 . 1 CL/mouse , vs lacZ guide n\u00a0=\u00a05 , 10 . 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 4 CL/mouse , two-tailed paired Student\u2019s t test with Welch\u2019s correction , t\u00a0=\u00a02 . 598 , df\u00a0=\u00a05 . 305 ) . Of note , variation was high in the Esr1 mice , with two looking similar to controls , two having fewer CL and two not having any CL . This suggests ovulation is disrupted in a substantial subpopulation of these mice but can proceed with the blunted LH surge in some animals . To test if knockdown of ER\u03b1 in adult AVPV kisspeptin neurons alters their intrinsic excitability , we recorded firing signatures of infected and uninfected cells in brain slices from AAV injected OVX\u00a0+\u00a0E mice . We again observed no difference between AVPV-AAV-Esr1 g1 vs g2 and combined these data . Some cells were loaded with neurobiotin during recording for identification and ER\u03b1 protein detected post\u00a0hoc with immunofluorescence ( Figure 4a , c , and IF post\u00a0hoc portions of Figure 4e\u2013j ) . Cells not infected with AVPV-AAV-Esr1 and cells infected with either AVPV-AAV-Esr1 guide but in which ER\u03b1 protein was detected exhibited similar firing signatures in terms of DIB and rebound bursts ( Figure 4b , e , f ) . In contrast , cells infected by AVPV-AAV-Esr1 that had undetectable ER\u03b1 protein had reduced burst firing compared to AVPV-AAV-lacZ or uninfected groups ( Figure 4e , f , Chi-square , DIB , p=0 . 008 , rebound bursts , p=0 . 0008; Fisher\u2019s exact post hoc test , DIB , Esr1 vs lacZ , or vs uninfected , p\u22640 . 03; rebound , Esr1 vs lacZ , or vs uninfected p\u22640 . 04; for other paired comparisons , p>0 . 5 ) . The firing signature of AAV-Esr1-infected cells with successful deletion of ER\u03b1 was comparable to cells from KERKO mice ( Chi-square , p>0 . 9 for both DIB and rebound bursts ) . Cells that lost detectable ER\u03b1 after AVPV-AAV-Esr1 infection also produced fewer action potentials with current injection than cells infected with AAV-lacZ ( Figure 4d left and center , two-way repeated-measures ANOVA/Holm-Sidak , Esr1 vs lacZ , 20 pA , p=0 . 08; 30 to 50 pA p\u22640 . 02 ) . This difference is not attributable to passive properties ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a , b ) . The relationship between current injection and number of action potentials fired ( input-output curve ) in cells from KERKO and in AVPV-AAV-Esr1 knockdown mice was only different at the highest level of current injected , with AVPV-AAV-Esr1-infected cells being less excitable ( Figure 4d , right , two-way repeated-measures ANOVA/Holm-Sidak , 50 pA , p=0 . 01 ) , despite no change in input resistance ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a , b KERKO vs AAV , p=0 . 08 ) . Action potential properties from AVPV-AAV-Esr1 knockdown cells with AVPV-AAV-lacZ control also differed . Specifically , loss of ER\u03b1 led to decreased action potential rate of rise , a trend toward prolonged full-width half-maximum ( FWHM ) , and hyperpolarized afterhyperpolarization potential ( AHP ) ( Figure 4\u2013j , two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-test , h , p=0 . 02 , j , p=0 . 0002; i , Mann-Whitney U-test , p=0 . 06 ) . In parallel , we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recording with single-cell PCR post\u00a0hoc identification of Esr1 mRNA on a separate set of cells ( AVPV-AAV-Esr1 , 10 cells from four mice; AVPV-AAV-lacZ , 9 cells from three mice; primers are in Table 4 ) . A similar decrease in burst firing and action potential input-output curve was observed in Esr1 mRNA negative cells as was observed in cells verified to have undetectable ER\u03b1 protein by immunofluorescence ( Figure 4e , f , Chi-square , DIB , p=0 . 04 , rebound p=0 . 03; Fisher\u2019s exact post hoc test , DIB , Esr1 vs lacZ p=0 . 03 . Esr1 vs uninfected , p=0 . 07; rebound , Esr1 vs lacZ p=0 . 02; for other paired comparisons , p>0 . 2 ) . Absence of Esr1 mRNA expression was again associated with decreased number of action potentials in response to current injection ( Figure 4d middle , Esr1 vs lacZ , p<0 . 002 for 20 to 50 pA steps ) . Absence of Esr1 mRNA , similar to loss of ER\u03b1 protein , led to decreased action potential rate of rise , prolonged FWHM , and AHP ( Figure 4g\u2013j , two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-test , h , p=0 . 02; i , p=0 . 006; j , p=0 . 02 ) . Single-cell PCR analysis also indicates that a lower percent of AVPV-AAV-Esr1 knockdown cells express Kiss1 and a trend to increase in Esr2 mRNA ( AVPV-AAV-Esr1 , 23 cells from four mice; AVPV-AAV-lacZ , 16 cells from three mice; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Interestingly , expression of the mRNA for progesterone receptor ( Pgr ) did not differ between groups ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , suggesting the estradiol-dependence of this gene may be paracrine regulated in the brain as in other tissues ( Hilton et al . , 2015 ) . We also examined gene expression for several ion channels , but none showed any changes or patterns of expression among groups ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . To examine the role of estradiol feedback on arcuate kisspeptin neurons , we delivered the AAV-sgRNAs bilaterally to the arcuate region to knockdown ER\u03b1 in these cells ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) ; these groups are referred to as Arc-AAV-Esr1 or Arc-AAV-lacZ . The infection rate for Arc-AAV-Esr1 was 92 \u00b1 3% ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 , n\u00a0=\u00a03 Esr1-guide1 96 \u00b1 2%; n\u00a0=\u00a03 Esr1-guide2 86 \u00b1 2% ) and only 34 \u00b1 3% of KNDy neurons expressed ER\u03b1 post infection ( Figure 5a n\u00a0=\u00a03 Esr1-g1 , 38 \u00b1 0 . 3%; n\u00a0=\u00a03 Esr1-g2 , 30 \u00b1 5% ) . In mice that received Arc-AAV-lacZ , the infection rate was comparable ( Figure 5a n\u00a0=\u00a03 , 94 \u00b1 3% ) , and 92 \u00b1 1% of KNDy neurons expressed ER\u03b1 , similar to control mice ( Kumar et al . , 2015 ) . Reproductive cycles were monitored for 12 days before and for up to eight weeks following surgery . In contrast to mice with Arc-AAV-Esr1 targeted to the AVPV region , mice with the same virus targeted to the arcuate began exhibiting disrupted cyclicity three to four weeks post surgery ( Figure 5b ) . These mice entered proestrus less frequently after surgery than before ( two\u00a0weeks pre-surgery plus the first two weeks post-surgery , Figure 5d , two-way repeated-measures ANOVA/Holm-Sidak , g1 , p=0 . 002 , g2 , p=0 . 03 ) . There was no difference in LH pulse frequency measured on the day of estrus or mean levels between Arc-AAV-Esr1 vs Arc-AAV-lacZ injected mice on estrus ( Figure 5c , e , f ) . Notably , LH response to kisspeptin and to GnRH was reduced in Arc-AAV-Esr1 mice ( Figure 5g , two-way repeated measures ANOVA/Holm-Sidak , lacZ , control vs kisspeptin or GnRH , p<0 . 001; Esr1 vs lacZ for kisspeptin and GnRH both , p\u22640 . 002 ) . Arcuate kisspeptin neurons are postulated to form an interconnected network that is steroid sensitive and utilizes glutamatergic transmission at least in part for intranetwork communication ( Qiu et al . , 2016 ) . We thus hypothesized that loss of ER\u03b1 specifically from arcuate kisspeptin neurons would increase their spontaneous firing rate and increase glutamatergic transmission to these cells , similar to what is observed in these cells in KERKO mice ( Wang et al . , 2018 ) . As Arc-AAV-Esr1 knockdown mice spend\u00a0the most time in estrus , similar to KERKO mice , we used estrus as the reproductive stage to examine the short-term ( ~10 min ) firing frequency of these neurons and AMPA-mediated excitatory glutamatergic postsynaptic currents ( EPSCs ) . The firing frequency of Arc-AAV-Esr1 infected cells was not different from Arc-AAV-lacZ infected cells ( Figure 6a , b , Mann-Whitney U-test , p=0 . 14 ) even though there tends to be more cells firing at\u00a0>1 Hz in the Arc-AAV-Esr1 group compared to the Arc-AAV-lacZ group ( Figure 6c , Fisher\u2019s exact test , Esr1 vs lacZ , p=0 . 07 ) . In contrast , the frequency and amplitude of glutamatergic EPSCs in arcuate kisspeptin cells in Arc-AAV-Esr1 infected mice was greater than in the Arc-AAV-lacZ group ( Figure 6d , e , f , two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-test , frequency p=0 . 0007 , amplitude p=0 . 014 ) . \n This study examined the roles of two hypothalamic kisspeptin neuronal populations in mediating estradiol feedback from cellular , molecular and whole-body physiology perspectives . We utilized both conventional kisspeptin-specific ER\u03b1 knockout mice ( KERKO ) and CRISPR-Cas9-based viral vector-mediated knockdown of Esr1 . The latter approach allows both temporal control and nucleus-specific manipulations to distinguish the role of ER\u03b1 within each population in negative and positive feedback regulation of LH release and neurobiological properties ( Figure 7 ) . AVPV kisspeptin neurons are postulated to convey estradiol positive feedback signals to generate the GnRH surge . Consistent with this postulate , these neurons are more excitable during positive feedback and also receive increased glutamatergic transmission ( Piet et al . , 2013; Zhang et al . , 2013; Wang et al . , 2016; Wang et al . , 2018 ) . AVPV kisspeptin cells in both KERKO and AVPV-AAV-Esr1 models are less excitable compared to controls , firing fewer bursts and single action potentials in response to the same current injection . Results from the AVPV-AAV-Esr1 model support and extend data from KERKO mice and provide evidence towards accepting the hypothesis that the role of ER\u03b1 in shifting excitability is activational , independent of its role in the development of these cells ( Mayer et al . , 2010 ) . Kisspeptin expression in AVPV cells is estradiol activated and fewer cells expressing Kiss1 mRNA are detected in this region in KERKO mice ( Greenwald-Yarnell et al . , 2016 ) . In AVPV-AAV-Esr1 mice with adult knockdown , we also observed fewer cells express Kiss1 mRNA compared to AVPV-AAV-lacZ mice , further supporting an activational role for estradiol in the adult physiology of these cells . The inability to sense estradiol through ER\u03b1 in AVPV kisspeptin neurons may reduce production and release of kisspeptin and ultimately impair the downstream GnRH/LH surge . This could explain the blunted LH surges in AVPV-AAV-Esr1 injected mice . Esr1 knockdown in\u00a0the AVPV , however , did not alter reproductive cyclicity monitored by changes in vaginal cytology . Vaginal cytology reflects circulating steroids , in particular estradiol . Of note , only some of these mice had evidence of typical ovulation monitored by the number of corpra lutea . It is possible that sufficient estradiol is produced during these cycles to induce vaginal cytology , but not to trigger an LH surge . It is important to point out , however , that estradiol-induced LH surges , in which an established dose of estradiol was provided to the mouse , were also blunted in AVPV-AAV-Esr1 mice . This latter observation suggests that inappropriate response of the neuroendocrine system to estradiol is , at least in part , responsible for the blunting of the LH surge . With regard to the continuation of estrous cycles in the AVPV-AAV-Esr1 mice , typical function of the remaining ER\u03b1-positive AVPV kisspeptin neurons may be sufficient to drive maintain cyclicity . Alternatively , cyclicity and the associated changes in sex steroids may be controlled by other cells that express ER\u03b1 . Of interest , stress or neuronal androgen receptor KO can similarly disrupt the LH surge without a change in estrous cyclicity ( Wagenmaker and Moenter , 2017; Walters et al . , 2018 ) . In support of a non-AVPV kisspeptin neuronal population being a primary driver of estrous cyclicity , several reproductive phenotypes of KERKO and AVPV-targeted ER\u03b1 knockdown mice are different . KERKO mice tend to exhibit prolonged vaginal cornification and enlarged uteri , neither of which were observed in mice in which AAV-Esr1 infection was targeted to the AVPV ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1c ) . In contrast , prolonged estrus and enlarged uteri were observed in mice in which Arc-AAV-Esr1 infection was targeted to arcuate kisspeptin neurons . These latter neurons have been postulated to play a role in generating episodic GnRH output . Changes in episodic GnRH frequency drive gonadotropins and thus follicle development and steroidogenesis , including the estradiol rise , which triggers positive feedback and changes in vaginal cytology . Long-term firing output of arcuate kisspeptin neurons in brain slices is episodic and steroid modulated ( Vanacker et al . , 2017 ) , and activation of these cells in vivo generates a pulse of LH release ( Clarkson et al . , 2017 ) . Further evidence comes from Tac2-specific ER\u03b1 KO mice , in which ER\u03b1 is primarily deleted from the arcuate , not the AVPV , kisspeptin population . These mice also exhibit prolonged vaginal cornification ( Greenwald-Yarnell et al . , 2016 ) . We thus hypothesize that ER\u03b1 in arcuate kisspeptin neurons contributes to maintaining pulsatile LH release and mediates central estradiol negative feedback . Consistent with this postulate , partial ( ~65% ) adult knockdown of ER\u03b1 in these cells altered the reproductive cycle . As KERKO mice exhibit increased LH-pulse frequency , we were initially surprised we did not observe differences in pulse frequency or mean LH levels in mice receiving Arc-AAV-Esr1 . This may be attributable to single housing conditions in the present experiment , which may make mice prone to stress despite more than four weeks of handling before sampling . It is also possible that the pulse frequency during diestrus differs between Arc-AAV-Esr1 and Arc-AAV-lacZ mice . Despite this lack of statistical difference in LH-pulse frequency , ER\u03b1 knockdown mice had\u00a0a markedly reduced response to IP injection of both kisspeptin and GnRH , similar to KERKO mice ( Wang et al . , 2018 ) . This suggests loss of ER\u03b1 function in arcuate kisspeptin neurons may disrupt GnRH neuronal response to kisspeptin and/or the pituitary response to GnRH . This could arise from a disruption of negative feedback leading to overstimulation and thus desensitization of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis or blunting of the response to administered neuropeptides . Dissection of the electrophysiological properties of arcuate kisspeptin neurons revealed that glutamatergic transmission to these neurons was elevated when ER\u03b1 is knocked down . This indicates the connectivity of these cells remains plastic even after puberty . The observation that targeted reduction of ER\u03b1 in arcuate kisspeptin neurons increases glutamatergic transmission further suggests interconnections among these cells provide many of their glutamatergic inputs . Given this , it is intriguing that the short-term firing rate of these cells was not increased , although there was a strong trend toward a greater percent of higher\u00a0frequency cells . The lack of change in mean firing rate may reflect the partial deletion of ER\u03b1 in this population , with lower firing rate being preserved in cells with ER\u03b1 , and elevated EPSC frequency arising at least in part from the high firing cells . It is also possible that long-term firing patterns of these Arc-AAV-Esr1 infected arcuate kisspeptin neurons , which may be associated with episodic neuroendocrine activity , are disrupted . These data support the idea that glutamatergic inputs to arcuate kisspeptin neurons play an important role on maintaining normal reproductive function . Although the CRISPR-Cas9-based knockdown approach allows spatial and temporal control , it too has caveats . For example , sgRNAs may have off-target actions on other regions of the genome beyond the sites predicted by the design software ( Anderson et al . , 2018 ) . To address this , we independently tested two sgRNAs that target Esr1 to address the possible off-target effects among groups . We did not observe any differences between Esr1 guide1 and guide2 groups . This suggests the phenotypes observed are primarily attributable to the deletion of ER\u03b1 . Because of the nature of the nonhomologous end joining repair machinery activated after CRISPR-Cas9-initiated cuts , Esr1 gene editing in each cell varies . It is difficult to assess each individual neuron to test if mutations at other genes are potentially involved in changes\u00a0of biophysical properties . Despite these variables , in the present study the systemic and cellular phenotypes in Esr1 guide1 vs guide2 infected mice were quite consistent . In conclusion , utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 AAV , we were able to successfully knockdown ER\u03b1 in specific populations of kisspeptin neurons in adult female mice . Knockdown in each population recapitulated part of the KERKO model and furthers our understanding the role ER\u03b1 in that population in regulating estradiol feedback . \n The University of Michigan Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures . Adult female mice ( 60\u2013150 days ) were used . Mice were provided with water and Harlan 2916 chow ( VetOne ) ad libitum and were held on a 14L:10D light cycle ( lights on 0400 Eastern Standard Time ) . To delete ER\u03b1 specifically from\u00a0all kisspeptin cells ( Wang et al . , 2018 ) , mice with the Cre recombinase gene knocked-in after the Kiss1 promoter ( Kiss1-ires-Cre mice , Cravo et al . , 2011 ) were crossed with mice with a floxed Esr1 gene , which encodes ER\u03b1 ( ER\u03b1 floxed mice ) ( Greenwald-Yarnell et al . , 2016 ) . The expression of Cre recombinase mediates deletion of ER\u03b1 in kisspeptin cells ( KERKO mice ) . To visualize kisspeptin neurons for recording , mice heterozygous for both Kiss-Cre and floxed ER\u03b1 were crossed with Cre-inducible YFP mice . Crossing mice heterozygous for all three alleles yielded litters that contained some mice that were homozygous for floxed ER\u03b1 and at least heterozygous for both Kiss1-Cre and YFP; these were used as KERKO mice . Littermates of KERKO mice with wild-type Esr1 , Kiss1-Cre YFP ( heterozygous or homozygous for either Cre or YFP ) were used as controls; no differences were observed among these controls and they were combined . To generate kisspeptin-specific S . pyogenes Cas9 ( Cas9 ) -expressing mice , mice with the Cre recombinase gene knocked-in after the Kiss1 promoter ( Kiss1-Cre mice ) were crossed with mice that have Cre recombinase-dependent expression of CRISPR-associated protein 9 ( Cas9 ) endonuclease , a 3X-FLAG epitope tag and eGFP directed by a CAG promoter . KERKO mice have disrupted estrous cycles with persistently cornified vaginal cytology typical of estrus; we thus used females in estrus as controls . Estrous cycle stage was determined by vaginal lavage . To examine the role of circulating estradiol , mice were ovariectomized ( OVX ) under isoflurane anesthesia ( Abbott ) and were either simultaneously implanted with a Silastic ( Dow-Corning ) capsule containing 0 . 625 \u00b5g of estradiol suspended in sesame oil ( OVX\u00a0+E ) or not treated further ( OVX ) ( Christian et al . , 2005 ) . Bupivacaine ( 0 . 25% , APP Pharmaceuticals ) was provided local to incisions as an analgesic . These mice were studied 2-3\u00a0days after surgery . Mice for electrophysiology were sacrificed at the time of estradiol positive feedback in the late afternoon ( Christian et al . , 2005 ) . For free-floating immunochemistry staining , mice were perfused at 1700 EST 2-3d post OVX\u00a0+E surgery at the expected peak of the estradiol-induced LH surge . For Cas9 target selection and generating single guide RNAs ( sgRNA ) , 20-nt target sequences were selected to precede a 5\u2019NGG protospacer-adjacent motif ( PAM ) sequence . To minimize off-targeting effects and maximize sgRNA activity , two CRISPR design tools were used to evaluate sgRNAs ( Ran et al . , 2013; Doench et al . , 2014 ) targeting the first coding exon of mouse Esr1 . The two best candidates were selected based on lowest predicted off-target effects and highest activity . The target sequence for guide 1 is 5\u2019-CACTGTGTTCAACTACCCCG-3\u2019 ( referred to as g1 ) and the target sequence for guide 2 is 3\u2019-CTCGGGGTAGTTGAACACAG-5\u2019 ( referred to as g2 ) . Because g1 and g2 were similarly effective in Esr1 knockdown and effects on cycles , mice were combined for physiology studies . Control sgRNA sequence was designed to target lacZ gene from Escherichia coli ( target sequence: 5\u2019-TGCGCAGCCTGAATGGCGAA \u22123\u2019 ) . Mycoplasma-free C2C12 mouse myoblast cells ( generous gift of Dr . Daniel Michele , University of Michigan ) were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS ( Thermo Fisher ) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 . Each individual sgRNA was introduced to BsmBI site of the lentiCRISPRv2 construct . Cells were co-transfected with one of the lentiCRISPRv2 plasmids containing sgRNAs and a standard GFP plasmid construct ( Ramakrishnan et al . , 2016 ) using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . Cells were selected for\u00a0~4 weeks with medium containing 1 \u03bcg/mL puromycin . Selected cells were harvested , DNA isolated using the Qiagen DNA Extraction Kit , and sequenced with primers for Esr1 . To construct the AAV plasmid , a mCherry-U6 promoter-sgRNA scaffold segment was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies ( IDT ) . After PCR amplification , the ligation product containing mCherry-U6 promoter-sgRNA scaffold was cloned in reverse orientation into a hSyn ( human Synapsin 1 ) promoter driven Cre-inducible AAV vector backbone ( Flak et al . , 2017 ) . The individual sgRNAs ( with an extra G added to the 5'-end of each sgRNA to increase guide efficiency [Doench et al . , 2014] ) were then inserted into a designed SapI site between U6 promoter and sgRNA scaffold component . All three AAV viral vectors were prepared in AAV8 serotype at University of North Carolina Vector Core . Kiss1Cre/Cas9-GFP female animals ( >2 mo ) were checked for estrous cycles for\u00a0>10 days before surgery; only mice with regular 4\u20135 day cycles were used . Mice were anesthetized with 1 . 5\u20132% isoflurane . AVPV injections were targeted to 0 . 55 mm posterior to Bregma , \u00b10 . 2 mm lateral to midline , and 4 . 7 and 4 . 8 mm ventral to dura . Arcuate injections were targeted to 1 . 5\u20131 . 7 mm posterior to Bregma , \u00b10 . 2 mm lateral to midline , and 5 . 9 mm ventral to dura . 100 nl virus injected bilaterally at the target coordinates at\u00a0~5 nl/min . The pipette was left in place for 5 min after injection to allow viral diffusion into the brain . Carprofen ( Zoetis , Inc . , 5 mg/kg , sc ) was given before and 24 hr after surgery to alleviate postsurgical pain . Estrous cycle monitoring continued after surgery for up to 8 weeks . Stereotaxic hits were defined as\u00a0\u226570% infection rate in both hemispheres; only bilateral hits were included for in vivo evaluation of reproductive parameters . Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and then transcardially perfused with PBS ( 15\u201320 mL ) then 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 10 min ( ~50 mL ) . Brains were placed into the same fixative overnight , followed by 30% sucrose for\u00a0\u226524 hr for cryoprotection . Sections ( 30 \u03bcm , four series ) were cut on a cryostat ( Leica CM3050S ) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C in antifreeze solution ( 25% ethylene glycol , 25% glycerol in PBS ) . Sections were washed with PBS , treated with 0 . 1% hydrogen peroxide , and then placed in blocking solution ( PBS containing 0 . 1% TritonX-100 , 4% normal goat serum , Jackson\u00a0Immunoresearch ) for 1 hr at room temperature , then incubated with rabbit anti-ER\u03b1 ( #06\u2013935 , Millipore , 1:10 , 000; this antibody recognizes the C-terminus of ER\u03b1 . ) in blocking solution 48 hr at 4\u00b0C . Sections were washed then incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody ( Jackson Immunoresearch , 1:500 ) followed by ABC amplification ( Vector Laboratories , 1:500 ) and nickel-enhanced diaminobenzidine ( Thermo Scientific ) reaction ( 4 . 5 min ) . Sections were washed with PBS and incubated overnight with chicken anti-GFP ( ab13970 , Abcam , 1:2000 ) and rat anti-mCherry ( M11217 , Invitrogen , 1:5000 ) in blocking solution . The next day , sections were washed and incubated with Alexa 594-conjugated anti-rat and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-chicken antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature ( Molecular Probes , 1:500 ) . Sections were mounted and coverslipped ( VWR International 48393 251 ) . Images were collected on a Zeiss AXIO Imager M2 microscope , and the number of immunoreactive GFP only , GFP/mCherry , and GFP/mCherry/ER\u03b1 cells were counted in the injected region . The other kisspeptin region in the hypothalamus was examined and no infection of kisspeptin cell bodies was observed . All solutions were bubbled with 95%O2 and 5%CO2 for\u00a0\u226515 min before exposure to tissue and throughout experiments . Brains were rapidly removed 1 . 5\u20132 hr before lights off and placed in ice-cold sucrose saline solution containing ( in mM ) : 250 sucrose , 3 . 5 KCl , 25 NaHCO3 , 10 D-glucose , 1 . 25 Na2HPO4 , 1 . 2 MgSO4 , and 3 . 8 MgCl2 . Coronal slides ( 300 \u03bcm ) were made with a Leica VT1200S . Slices were incubated in a 1:1 mixture of sucrose-saline and artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( ACSF ) containing ( in mM ) : 135 NaCl , 3 . 5 KCl , 26 NaHCO3 , 10 D-glucose , 1 . 25 Na2HPO4 , 1 . 2 MgSO4 , 2 . 5 CaCl2 for 30 min at room temperature . Slices were then transferred to 100% ACSF at room temperature for\u00a0\u226530 min before recording . Slices were used within 6 hr of preparation . Slices were transferred to a recording chamber and perfused with oxygenated ACSF ( 3 mL/min ) and heated by an in-line heater ( Warner Instruments ) to 30 \u00b1 1\u00b0C . GnRH-GFP neurons were identified by brief illumination at 470 nm using an upright fluorescence microscope Olympus BX51W1 . Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass ( type 7052 , 1 . 65 mm outer diameter and 1 . 12 mm inner diameter; World Precision Instruments , Inc ) using a P-97 puller ( Sutter Instruments ) to obtain pipettes with a resistance of 2\u20133 . 5 M\u03a9 . Recordings were performed with an EPC-10 dual-patch clamp amplifier and Patchmaster acquisition software ( HEKA Elektronik ) . Recorded cells were mapped to a brain atlas ( Paxinos and Franklin , 2001 ) to determine if cell location was related to response to treatment . No such correlation was observed in this study . Extracellular recordings were used to characterize firing rate as they maintain internal milieu and have minimal impact neuronal firing rate ( Nunemaker et al . , 2003; Alcami et al . , 2012 ) . Recordings were made with receptors for ionotropic GABAA and glutamate synaptic transmission antagonized ( 100 \u00b5M picrotoxin , 20 \u00b5M D-APV [D- ( \u2212 ) \u22122-amino-5-phosphonopentenoic acid] , 10 \u00b5M CNQX [6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline] ) . Pipettes were filled with HEPES-buffered solution containing ( in mM ) : 150 NaCl , 10 HEPES , 10 D-glucose , 2 . 5 CaCl2 , 1 . 3 MgCl2 , and 3 . 5 KCl ( pH\u00a0=\u00a07 . 4 , 310 mOsm ) , and low-resistance ( 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 M\u03a9 ) seals formed between the pipette and neuron after first exposing the pipette to the slice tissue in the absence of positive pressure . Recordings were made in voltage-clamp mode ( 0 mV pipette holding potential ) and signals acquired at 20 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz . Resistance of the loose seal was checked frequently during the first 3 min of recordings to ensure a stable baseline , and also before and after a subsequent 10 min recording period; data were not used if seal resistance changed\u00a0>30% or was\u00a0>25 M\u03a9 . The first 5 min of this 10-min recording were consistently stable among cells and were thus used for analysis . For whole-cell patch-clamp recordings , three different pipette solutions were used depending on the goal . Most recordings were done with a physiologic pipette solution containing ( in mM ) : 135 K gluconate , 10 KCl , 10 HEPES , 5 EGTA , 0 . 1 CaCl2 , 4 MgATP and 0 . 4 NaGTP , pH 7 . 2 with NaOH , 302\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 mOsm . A similar solution containing 10 mM neurobiotin was adjusted to similar osmolarity . A solution in which cesium gluconate replaced potassium gluconate was used to reduce potassium currents and allow better isolation of calcium currents . Membrane potentials reported were corrected online for liquid junction potential of \u221215 . 7 mV , same among all solutions ( Barry , 1994 ) . After achieving a minimum 1 . 6 G\u03a9 seal and the whole-cell configuration , membrane potential was held at \u221270 mV between protocols during voltage-clamp recordings . Series resistance ( Rs ) , input resistance ( Rin ) , holding current ( Ihold ) and membrane capacitance ( Cm ) were frequently measured using a 5 mV hyperpolarizing step from \u221270 mV ( mean of 16 repeats ) . Only recordings with Rin\u00a0>500 M\u03a9 , Ihold\u221240 to 10 pA and RS\u00a0<20 M\u03a9 , and stable Cm were accepted . Rs was further evaluated for stability and any voltage-clamp recordings with \u2206Rs\u00a0>15% were excluded; current-clamp recordings with \u2206Rs\u00a0>20% were excluded . There was no difference in Ihold , Cm , or Rs among any comparisons . For current-clamp recordings , depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current injections ( \u221250 to\u00a0+50 pA , 500 ms , 10 pA increments ) were applied from an initial membrane potential of \u221271\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 mV , near the resting membrane potential of these cells ( DeFazio et al . , 2014 ) . For voltage-clamp recordings of excitatory postsynaptic currents ( EPSCs ) , membrane potential was held at \u221268 mV , the reversal potential for GABAA-receptor mediated currents , and ACSF contained picrotoxin ( 100 \u03bcM ) , and D-APV ( 20 \u03bcM ) . For voltage-clamp recordings of IT , ACSF containing antagonists of ionotropic GABAA and glutamate receptors was supplemented with TTX ( 2 \u00b5M ) and the Cs-based pipette solution was used . Two voltage protocols were used to isolate IT as reported ( Wang et al . , 2016 ) . First , total calcium current activation was examined . Inactivation was removed by hyperpolarizing the membrane potential to \u2212110 mV for 350 ms ( not shown in figures ) . Next , a 250 ms prepulse of \u2212110 mV was given . Then membrane potential was varied in 10 mV increments for 250 ms from \u2212110 to \u221230 mV . Finally , test pulse of \u221240 mV for 250 ms was given . From examination of the current during the test pulse , it was evident that no sustained ( high-voltage activated , HVA ) calcium current was activated at potentials more hyperpolarized than \u221240 mV . To remove HVA contamination from the step to \u221230 mV , a second protocol was used in which removal of inactivation ( \u2212110 mV , 350 ms ) was followed by a 250 ms prepulse at \u221240 mV , then a step for 250 ms at \u221230 mV and finally a test pulse of \u221240 mV for 250 ms . IT was isolated by subtracting the trace following the \u221240 mV prepulse from those obtained after the \u2212110 mV prepulse for the depolarized variable step to \u221230 mV; raw traces from the initial voltage protocol were used without subtraction for variable steps from \u2212110 mV to \u221240 mV because of the lack of observed activation of HVA at these potentials . Activation of IT was assessed from the resulting family of traces by peak current during the variable step phase . Inactivation of IT was assessed from the peak current during the final \u221240 mV test pulse . The pipette solution containing neurobiotin was used for recordings cells from AAV-injected mice . An outside-out patch was formed after recording to reseal the membrane and the location of cells was marked on a brain atlas ( Paxinos and Franklin , 2001 ) . The brain slices were fixed overnight in 10% formalin at 4\u00b0C and changed to PBS . Slices were photo-bleached with a UV illuminator for\u00a0~72 hr and checked to ensure no visible fluorescent signal was observed . Slices were then placed in blocking solution for 1 hr , then incubated with rabbit anti-ER\u03b1 for 48 hr at 4\u00b0C . Slices were washed and then incubated with Alexa 594-conjugated anti-rabbit and Alexa 350-conjugated neutravidin for 2 hr at room temperature ( Molecular Probes , 1:500 ) . Slices were mounted , coverslipped and imaged as above . Cells with neurobiotin-labeling were examined for ER\u03b1-immunoreactivity . Single-cell PCR Cells for single cell PCR were collected as previously described ( Ruka et al . , 2013 ) . Patch pipettes ( 2\u20133 M\u03a9 ) were filled with 5\u20138 \u03bcL of an RNase free solution containing ( in mM ) : 135 K-gluconate , 10 KCl , 10 HEPES , 5 EGTA , 4 . 0 Mg-ATP , 0 . 4 Na-GTP , and 1 . 0 CaCl2 ( pH 7 . 3 , 305 mOsm ) . Additionally , just before use 1 U/\u00b5L Protector RNase Inhibitor ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) was added to the pipette solution . Single-cell RNA was harvested from the target cells in whole-cell configuration after recording membrane response in current-clamp; cytoplasm was aspirated into the pipette and expelled into a 0 . 2 mL tube containing reverse transcriptase buffer ( Superscript Vilo cDNA Synthesis Kit , Invitrogen/ThermoFisher ) , volume was adjusted to 20 \u00b5L with molecular grade water . Cell contents were reverse transcribed following manufacturer\u2019s instructions . False harvests , in which the pipette was lowered into the slice preparation but no aspiration of cell contents occurred , were used to estimate background contamination . These were performed on each recording day . Additionally , a standard curve of mouse hypothalamic RNA ( 1 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 01 , 0 . 001 ng/\u03bcL final concentration ) and a water blank ( negative control ) were reverse transcribed . An equivalent volume of water or patch solution was reverse transcribed as a negative control . Single-cell cDNA , controls , and the standard curve were preamplified for 15 cycles using TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix ( Invitrogen/ThermoFisher ) as previously described ( Glanowska et al . , 2014 ) . Quantitative PCR was performed using 5 \u03bcL of diluted preamplified DNA ( 1:10 ) per reaction , in duplicate , for 50 cycles ( TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix; Invitrogen ) . Single-cell cDNA was assayed for: Kiss1 , TH , Esr1 , Esr2 , Pgr , Cacna1g , Cacna1h , Cacna1i , Hcn1 Hcn2 Hcn3 Hcn4; Syn1 was used as housekeeping gene; only Syn1-positive cells were analyzed . Single cells were considered positive for a transcript if their threshold was a minimum of three cycles earlier ( eight fold greater ) than the false harvests and the reverse transcribed and preamplified water blank sample . TaqMan PrimeTime qPCR assays for mRNAs ( Table 4 ) were purchased from IDT . Ovary-intact Kiss1Cre-Cas9 adult female mice with AAV-lacZ and AAV-Esr1 targeted to the arcuate nucleus were singly-housed were handled daily\u00a0\u22654 wks before sampling . Vaginal cytology was determined for\u00a0\u226510 days before sampling . As the majority of AAV-Esr1 arcuate targeted mice ( 6 of 9 ) exhibit prolonged cornification typical of estrus , all mice ( Esr1 and lacZ ) were sampled during estrus . Repetitive tail-tip blood collecting was performed as described ( Steyn et al . , 2013 ) . After the excision of the very tip of the tail , blood ( 6 \u00b5L ) was collected every 6 min for 2 hr from 1pm to 3pm . At the end of this frequent sampling period , mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of kisspeptin ( 65 \u00b5g/kg ) ( Hanchate et al . , 2012 ) . Blood was collected just before and 15 min after kisspeptin injection . GnRH ( 150 \u00b5g/kg ) ( Glanowska et al . , 2014 ) was injected 40\u201345 min after kisspeptin , with blood collected immediately before and 15 min after GnRH injection . Ovary-intact Kiss1Cre-Cas9 adult female mice with AAV-lacZ and AAV-Esr1 targeted to the AVPV were singly-housed . Tail blood was collected as above on proestrus at 3 , 4 and 5pm EST ( lights are off at 5pm EST in the mouse room ) . One to two weeks later , these same mice were then subjected to OVX\u00a0+\u00a0E surgery and tail blood ( 6 \u00b5L ) was collected 2\u20133 days post-surgery at 9am and 5pm EST . Whole blood was immediately diluted in 54 \u03bcL of 0 . 1M PBS with 0 . 05% Tween 20% and 0 . 2% BSA , mixed and kept on ice . Samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0C for a subsequent ultrasensitive LH assay ( Steyn et al . , 2013 ) . Intraassay CV was 2 . 2%; interassay CVs were 7 . 3% ( low QC , 0 . 13 ng/mL ) , 5 . 0% ( medium QC , 0 . 8 ng/mL ) and 6 . 5% ( high QC , 2 . 3 ng/mL ) . Functional sensitivity was 0 . 016 ng/mL . Ovaries were fixed for 24 hr in 10% neutral-buffered formalin , then stored in 70% ethanol until paraffin embedding , sectioning ( 5 \u00b5m ) and H and E staining . Every fifth section was examined and corpra lutea counted . Data were analyzed offline using custom software written in IgorPro 6 . 31 ( Wavemetrics ) . For targeted extracellular recordings , mean firing rate in Hz was determined over 5 min of stable recording . In experiments examining IT , the peak current amplitude at each step potential ( V ) was first converted to conductance using the calculated reversal potential of Ca2+ ( ECa ) and G\u00a0=\u00a0I/ ( ECa - V ) , because driving force was linear over the range of voltages examined . The voltage dependencies of activation and steady-state inactivation were described with a single Boltzmann distribution: G ( V ) =Gmax/ ( 1- exp [ ( V1/2 - Vt ) /k] ) , where Gmax is the maximal conductance , V1/2 is the half-maximal voltage , and k is the slope . Current density of IT at each tested membrane potential was determined by dividing peak current by membrane capacitance . LH pulses were detected by a version of Cluster ( Veldhuis and Johnson , 1986 ) transferred to IgorPro using cluster sizes of two points for both peak and nadir and t-scores of two for detection of increases and decreases . Data were analyzed using Prism 7 ( GraphPad Software ) and reported as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM . The number of cells per group is indicated by n and the number of mice by N in Table 5 . For two-by-two designs , data were normally distributed and analyzed by two-way ANOVA or two-way repeated-measures ( RM ) with Holm-Sidak post\u00a0hoc . For two group comparisons , normally-distributed data were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-test; non-normal data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test . For categorical data , for more than three categories , Chi-square test of independence was used with Fisher\u2019s exact test as post\u00a0hoc analysis . For two categories , Fisher\u2019s exact test was used . For each electrophysiological parameter comparison , no more than three cells per mouse was used in control and KERKO mice; no more than four cells per mouse was used for AAV-infected mice . No less than five mice were tested per parameter . The variance of the data was no smaller within an animal than among animals . For IF staining , LH surge and LH pulse measurements , and reproductive cyclicity , at least three mice were tested per AAV vector ."}

Newly made proteins need to \u2018fold\u2019 into precise three-dimensional shapes in order to carry out their roles . However , proteins sometimes fold incorrectly or unfold . These protein forms are not able to work effectively and in some cases may even cause diseases . Chaperone proteins help other proteins to fold correctly and are found in living organisms ranging in complexity from bacteria to humans . There are many different types of chaperones that play different roles inside cells . One , called Hsp70 , binds to proteins that are incorrectly folded to help them to mature into their correct structures . However , it was not clear whether Hsp70 can also associate with the mature , correctly folded form of the proteins . A technique called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy can distinguish between mature , unfolded and chaperone-bound forms of the same protein . Sekhar et al . therefore used NMR to investigate which forms of a protein Hsp70 binds to . This revealed that both the bacterial and human versions of the Hsp70 chaperone interact only with unfolded proteins . The results presented by Sekhar et al . also explain why Hsp70 does not disrupt the routine workings of the cell: because it does not bind to mature forms of proteins . These observations extend our understanding of how chaperones assist in folding proteins , and fit into a broader research theme exploring how proteins recognize one another . It will now be interesting to see whether the same mechanism holds for more complex forms of proteins , such as aggregates , or larger protein structures with regions of both folded and unfolded elements .", "source": "Molecular recognition is integral to biological function and frequently involves preferred binding of a molecule to one of several exchanging ligand conformations in solution . In such a process the bound structure can be selected from the ensemble of interconverting ligands a priori ( conformational selection , CS ) or may form once the ligand is bound ( induced fit , IF ) . Here we focus on the ubiquitous and conserved Hsp70 chaperone which oversees the integrity of the cellular proteome through its ATP-dependent interaction with client proteins . We directly quantify the flux along CS and IF pathways using solution NMR spectroscopy that exploits a methyl TROSY effect and selective isotope-labeling methodologies . Our measurements establish that both bacterial and human Hsp70 chaperones interact with clients by selecting the unfolded state from a pre-existing array of interconverting structures , suggesting a conserved mode of client recognition among Hsp70s and highlighting the importance of molecular dynamics in this recognition event . \n An elaborate network of chaperones is present in organisms across all domains of life to oversee the health of the cellular proteome ( Balchin et al . , 2016 ) . The Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones occupies a central node in this network , steering proteins synthesized on the ribosome to their native conformations , as well as cooperating with the machinery of protein disaggregation , refolding and proteolysis to control the fate of improperly folded and aggregated cellular proteins ( Mayer and Bukau , 2005; Mayer , 2013; Mogk et al . , 2015; Rosenzweig et al . , 2013 ) . Hsp70 interacts with client substrates via an ATP-dependent chaperone cycle that is tightly regulated by Hsp40 co-chaperones and nucleotide exchange factors ( NEFs ) ( Balchin et al . , 2016; Mayer and Bukau , 2005; Mayer , 2013 ) . Substrates are brought to the cycle by either Hsp40 or ATP-bound Hsp70 and typically undergo multiple rounds of binding and release before either folding to the native state or being transferred to downstream chaperone systems such as GroEL/ES and ClpB ( bacteria ) or Hsp90 and Hsp104 ( eukaryotes ) . Hsp70 is a 70 kDa protein that consists of a 45 kDa N-terminal ATPase domain ( NBD ) and a 25 kDa C-terminal substrate binding domain ( SBD ) ( Figure 1A ) ( Mayer and Bukau , 2005 ) . Much of our understanding of client recognition by Hsp70 derives from studies of peptide-based substrates . Crystal ( Zhu et al . , 1996; Zahn et al . , 2013 ) and NMR structures ( Stevens et al . , 2003 ) of peptide-bound SBDs establish that the substrate binds in an extended conformation , with a 4\u20135 amino acid core of the substrate forming backbone hydrogen bonds as well as hydrophobic contacts with chaperone residues Val 436 , Ile 401 and Ile 438 that line the SBD binding pocket ( Figure 1B ) . The hydrophobic nature of the central binding pocket governs the preference of Hsp70 for substrate sequences enriched in large aliphatic hydrophobic sidechains such as Ile , Leu and Val ( R\u00fcdiger et al . , 1997 ) . Studies on full length protein substrates have revealed that these are globally unfolded in the Hsp70-bound state ( Palleros et al . , 1994; Kurt et al . , 2006; Chen et al . , 2006; Kurt and Cavagnero , 2008; Sharma et al . , 2010; Kellner et al . , 2014; Lee et al . , 2015; Sekhar et al . , 2015 ) and lack long-range interactions ( Sekhar et al . , 2016 ) , though they can form local residual native ( Sekhar et al . , 2015 ) and non-native secondary structure ( Kurt and Cavagnero , 2008 ) in regions far from the Hsp70 binding site . The ability of Hsp70 to recognize commonly occurring sequences in typical proteins with a frequency of about 1 in 40 residues makes it a promiscuous interactor ( Rosenzweig et al . , 2017 ) , generating a highly heterogeneous Hsp70-substrate ensemble that ensures the efficient search of conformational space for an optimal folding pathway ( Lee et al . , 2015; Rosenzweig et al . , 2017; Sekhar et al . , 2017 ) . The structural constraints of the Hsp70 binding pocket ( Figure 1C ) are such that only an unfolded stretch of polypeptide can fit into the binding groove if the helical lid is closed ( Zhu et al . , 1996 ) , though more compact protein conformations can be accommodated if the lid is partially open ( Schlecht et al . , 2011 ) . Hsp70 function involves altering the conformation of client proteins ( Mayer , 2013; Rodriguez et al . , 2008; Goloubinoff and De Los Rios , 2007; Clerico et al . , 2015 ) during folding ( Sharma et al . , 2010; Szabo et al . , 1994 ) and disaggregation ( Mogk et al . , 2015 ) , as well as dismantling of oligomeric assemblies such as clathrin coats ( B\u00f6cking et al . , 2011; Sousa et al . , 2016 ) that surround vesicles involved in intra-cellular trafficking . However , the molecular mechanism by which Hsp70 causes these diverse conformational changes remains poorly understood . The structures of the Hsp70 chaperone in its ATP ( Kityk et al . , 2012; Qi et al . , 2013 ) ( Figure 1D ) and ADP states ( Bertelsen et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure 1A ) are substantially different and the conformational switch that occurs in Hsp70 upon ATP hydrolysis has been hypothesized to perform conformational work on the bound substrate and alter its structure ( Mayer , 2013; Clerico et al . , 2015 ) . Contrary to this hypothesis , NMR studies by our group have shown that the dominant native ( i . e . , unbound ) and bound conformations of a substrate can be significantly different despite the fact that the structure of the substrate in the ADP-bound , ATP-bound and nucleotide-free forms of Hsp70 are identical , showing that ATP hydrolysis does not have to be coupled to a substrate conformational change in the Hsp70 chaperone system ( Sekhar et al . , 2015 ) . Two limiting-case mechanisms have been proposed for the binding of Hsp70 to its target substrates , namely conformational selection ( CS ) and induced fit ( IF ) , also referred to in some reports as the holdase and the unfoldase models , respectively ( Mayer , 2013; Sharma et al . , 2010; Rodriguez et al . , 2008; Goloubinoff and De Los Rios , 2007; Clerico et al . , 2015; B\u00f6cking et al . , 2011; Slepenkov and Witt , 2002 ) . In some cases conformational transitions in the substrate may occur in the absence of Hsp70 binding but still form an important component of the binding process . For example , the binding of Hsp70 to the clathrin triskelion that leads to downstream uncoating of a clathrin-coated vesicle has been postulated to occur via local conformational fluctuations in individual clathrin molecules that transiently expose the Hsp70 binding site ( B\u00f6cking et al . , 2011 ) . The recognition of \u03c332 by E . coli Hsp70 ( DnaK ) has also been hypothesized to occur through transient excursions of the \u03c332 molecule from a compact conformation where the binding site is sequestered in a helix to a more accessible extended structure ( Rodriguez et al . , 2008 ) . In contrast , the IF-like unfoldase model is believed to operate in accelerating the folding of large protein substrates such as luciferase by transforming misfolded kinetically trapped states into unfolded but folding-competent conformations ( Sharma et al . , 2010 ) . In general , distinguishing between CS and IF mechanisms ( Changeux and Edelstein , 2011 ) requires a consideration of both structure and kinetics . For example , in order to establish that a particular binding interaction occurs via CS , it is necessary both to demonstrate that a very similar conformation to that in the bound state is sampled in the absence of the binder and to show that the formation of the complex occurs primarily via a kinetic pathway whereby the conformation of the ligand that resembles the bound form is selected for binding . While there is compelling evidence in a number of cases for the pre-sampling of a bound conformation in the unbound state ( Boehr et al . , 2009; Tzeng and Kalodimos , 2009; Ye et al . , 2016; Lange et al . , 2008; Anthis et al . , 2011; Venditti and Clore , 2012 ) , very few reports have unequivocally established that such a conformation is on-pathway to the bound state ( Birdsall et al . , 1980; Daniels et al . , 2014; Daniels et al . , 2015; Chakrabarti et al . , 2016 ) . Indeed , pre-sampling of a bound conformation does not automatically imply that the bound state forms from such a conformation . Several recent studies have sought to make this clarification by formulating the CS and IF mechanisms in terms of the flux of molecules flowing through the two pathways to the bound state ( Hammes et al . , 2009; Weikl and Paul , 2014 ) . Herein , in an effort to further characterize how Hsp70 chaperones bind to cognate substrates , we address which of the competing pathways , CS or IF , better explains the binding interaction between Hsp70 and its targets . We consider a pair of folding competent substrates with very different secondary structures ( \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet ) and both E . coli and human ( Hsc70 ) chaperones and probe the binding reaction using magnetization exchange ( Farrow et al . , 1994; Palmer et al . , 2001 ) and chemical exchange saturation transfer ( CEST ) NMR methodology ( Vallurupalli et al . , 2017; Anthis and Clore , 2015 ) , which simultaneously provide structural information about each of the participating components as well as the kinetics of the recognition event . The NMR experiments exploit selective isotope labeling ( Kerfah et al . , 2015 ) and methyl transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy ( methyl TROSY ) ( Tugarinov et al . , 2003; Ollerenshaw et al . , 2003 ) approaches so that large protein assemblies such as the Hsp70-substrate complex can be probed quantitatively at atomic resolution . We have carried out equilibrium measurements and analyzed the resulting kinetic parameters in terms of fluxes along the competing CS and IF pathways , where formation of the unfolded bound conformer is predominantly the result of chaperone binding to either unfolded or native substrate states , respectively . Our results establish that the dominant binding process is via the CS mechanism for both substrates considered , and for both DnaK and human Hsc70 , suggesting that the CS mode of Hsp70 recognition may be conserved . Our data highlight the importance of molecular dynamics in Hsp70 chaperone-substrate binding and emphasize the potential of NMR spectroscopy in providing unambiguous mechanistic insights into key biological processes that involve molecular interactions . \n In what follows we consider a solution comprising client protein substrate and Hsp70 ( referred to as K ) at equilibrium . The client protein is not characterized by a single structure , but rather by an ensemble of conformers , ranging from native ( N ) to unfolded ( U ) ; in the examples that follow both N and U states are approximately equally populated , and are in principle , both available to form a substrate-Hsp70 bound complex . A number of different biophysical experiments , performed on a variety of Hsp70 complexes , has established that the substrate is unfolded in the bound state , UK ( Palleros et al . , 1994; Chen et al . , 2006; Sharma et al . , 2010; Kellner et al . , 2014; Lee et al . , 2015; Sekhar et al . , 2015 ) . Our goal is to obtain mechanistic insights into the binding reaction by considering the flux from either conformers U or N to UK so as to evaluate what the dominant pathway for the Hsp70 - substrate interaction might be and hence establish whether binding is best described in terms of a CS or IF mechanism . As described in the Introduction , in the IF ( unfoldase ) model the dominant process involves Hsp70 binding to N to form a preliminary complex ( NK ) , where the bound substrate has an N-like structure , that is subsequently unfolded to form the dominant bound conformation ( UK ) . The reaction can be denoted as N\u2192NK\u2192UK , although in principle more complex schemes can also be included so long as they do not involve the U\u2192UK step . In contrast , in the CS ( holdase ) model , as we consider it here , Hsp70 selects a substrate conformer that structurally resembles the bound state ( UK ) from an equilibrium mixture , with larger fluxes for reactions that proceed via this path ( U\u2192UK ) than for those involving N\u2192NK\u2192UK . It is important to emphasize that a number of pathways fit the description of the CS mechanism , including both N\u2192U\u2192UK and the simpler U\u2192UK . Indeed , in cases where the N , U conformational interconversion is limiting kinetically the flux through the U\u2192UK pathway will be larger than the more complex CS scheme that begins with N . Since the distinction between the CS and IF models involves a consideration of both structure and kinetics , our strategy here is to use magnetization exchange ( zz-exchange ) ( Farrow et al . , 1994; Palmer et al . , 2001 ) or CEST NMR ( Vallurupalli et al . , 2017 ) experiments that both resolve different conformers through chemical shifts and facilitate extraction of rates of interconversion . Figure 2A shows a schematic of a zz-exchange spectrum for a two-site exchange reaction , A\u21cckBAkABB . In this experiment the chemical shifts of NMR signals are measured both before and after a delay during which chemical exchange occurs . Because the experiment is constructed essentially as a 13C-1H HMQC , whereby 13C and 1H chemical shifts are recorded before and after the exchange period , respectively , a dataset is generated in\u00a0which for\u00a0each methyl group a pair of peaks ( diagonal-peaks ) is obtained at the resonance positions for the 1H and 13C methyl spins that are associated with the two interconverting states . An additional pair of peaks ( cross-peaks ) is also present that link the diagonal peaks , derived from the transfer of longitudinal magnetization from A to B or B to A during the exchange period . Quantification of the buildup and decay of the cross- and diagonal-peaks , respectively , as a function of the duration of the exchange period enables the extraction of rates of interconversion and equilibrium populations of states . Figure 2B illustrates a hypothetical CEST profile , again focusing on a two-state exchange process . In this experiment the intensity of an observed peak ( say from a proton of residue j of state A ) is monitored as a function of the position of a weak radio frequency ( rf ) 1H field that perturbs magnetization resonating at or close to the frequency of application of the weak field . The field , applied for a duration TEX , is scanned across all possible frequencies ( one frequency per experiment ) , eventually perturbing the corresponding proton magnetization from residue j of state B and this perturbation is subsequently transferred to the observed peak ( A ) due to chemical exchange . Thus , a plot of the intensity ratio of the A state peak ( I/Io , where I and Io are the intensities of peak A when the field is ( TEX \u2260 0 ) and is not ( TEX\u00a0=\u00a00 ) applied , respectively ) as a function of frequency shows a major dip at the resonance position of the target proton in state A and a minor dip at the position of the resonance frequency of the proton in state B . Note that there is an analogy between the CEST profiles from A and B and a zz-exchange dataset , with the major dips in CEST corresponding to the diagonal peaks in zz-exchange , connected via the minor dips in the two profiles , similar to the zz-exchange crosspeaks . The resulting curves from zz-exchange or CEST profiles can be fit to the Bloch-McConnell equations ( McConnell , 1958 ) that include the effects of chemical exchange to extract parameters of the interconversion process . There are a number of important experimental constraints which must be taken into account in the choice of Hsp70 substrates for study via these two approaches . For example , if the N , U interconversion is significantly faster than the binding step the distinction between N and U becomes \u2018blurred\u2019 and it becomes difficult to distinguish binding starting from N or from U . This is illustrated in the context of a set of reactions , N\u21cckUNkNUUU+K\u21cckoffkonUKUKwhere N and U are DnaK-free conformations of the substrate and K refers to DnaK . Focusing on CEST , Figure 2C shows that the N ( red ) and U ( green ) profiles become indistinguishable for fast interconversion ( kex , NU\u00a0>>\u00a0kex , UK , where kex , NU\u00a0=\u00a0kNU\u00a0+ kUN , kex , UK=konUK[K]+koff; kex , NU << \u0394\u03c9NU where \u0394\u03c9NU is the chemical shift difference between corresponding peaks in states N and U ) , while if the interconversion is slow ( kex , NU\u00a0<<\u00a0kex , UK ) then the mechanism of binding can clearly be discerned from a comparison of the CEST profiles of N and U , since only the latter shows a minor dip at the chemical shift of the reporter nucleus in the bound state in this case ( Figure 2D ) . Similarly , assuming kex , NU\u00a0<<\u00a0kex , UK in a zz-exchange experiment for the same CS-based mechanism as above ( Figure 2E ) , cross-peaks are observed only between U and UK , while for an induced-fit mode of binding cross-peaks connect only N and UK ( Figure 2F ) . In addition , rates of interconversion must be on the order of\u00a0~1 s\u22121 or faster for zz-exchange ( Farrow et al . , 1994; Palmer et al . , 2001 ) if all of the exchange parameters are to be extracted robustly , or\u00a0~20 s\u22121 for the CEST experiment ( Vallurupalli et al . , 2017 ) in the general case where profiles from only one of the interconverting species can be measured . Notably , in cases where peaks from N , U and UK are visible in spectra this restriction is relaxed for the analysis of CEST profiles as we show below . Finally , it is worth emphasizing that , in the above discussion , we have assumed that exchange rates are slow compared to chemical shift differences between spins in interconverting states , N , U and UK , so that separate correlations are observed for each state in NMR datasets . The N and U states defined above may themselves be composed of sub-ensembles of interconverting conformers , for example {N1 , N2 , . . . } and {U1 , U2 , . . . } . In constructing the CS and IF models in terms of N and U states it is assumed that the interconversion between sub-states Ni or between Ui occurs much faster than the N-U exchange or than ligand binding , with a rate that is fast on the NMR chemical shift timescale . In this manner only single distinct NMR peaks are observed for spins in N or U states rather than separate peaks for each element of the sub-ensembles ( Ni ) or ( Ui ) so that N or U can thus be treated as single \u2018averaged\u2019 conformers . It naturally follows that the affinities and rates obtained from NMR experiments will be averages over the members of each sub-ensemble . It is also the case that additional intermediates such as alternate unfolded states ( U* ) can be explicitly included in any model of exchange only if their presence is detected either by distinct peaks in NMR spectra or by minor dips in CEST profiles . As a first substrate we focused on the slow-folding marginally stable L90A mutant of the 17th domain of chicken-brain \u03b1-spectrin ( referred to as R17* ) ( Scott et al . , 2006 ) . R17* is a three-helix bundle protein domain ( Figure 3A ) with kinetics and thermodynamics of folding that suggest that it may be an ideal candidate for distinguishing between different Hsp70 binding mechanisms using the NMR approaches described above ( Scott et al . , 2006 ) . R17* has a strong predicted ( R\u00fcdiger et al . , 1997 ) Hsp70 binding site and the sidechains ( 41IQGLL45 ) forming this binding site are\u00a0>40% solvent-exposed on average ( Figure 3B ) , potentially facilitating binding of Hsp70 to the native protein along an IF pathway . On the other hand the low stability of the folded domain suggests a large population of the U state in solution ( see below ) that might favour the CS route . E . coli DnaK is the Hsp70 ortholog that has been most extensively characterized at structural ( Kityk et al . , 2012; Qi et al . , 2013; Bertelsen et al . , 2009; Pellecchia et al . , 2000; Harrison et al . , 1997 ) , kinetic ( Sharma et al . , 2010; Slepenkov and Witt , 2002; Gisler et al . , 1998; Grimshaw et al . , 2001; Grimshaw et al . , 2003; Han and Christen , 2003; Pierpaoli et al . , 1998; Schmid et al . , 1994; Chesnokova and Witt , 2005; Slepenkov and Witt , 1998; Jordan and McMacken , 1995; Russell et al . , 1998 ) and mechanistic levels ( Sharma et al . , 2010; Szabo et al . , 1994; Landry et al . , 1992; Schr\u00f6der et al . , 1993; Sch\u00f6nfeld et al . , 1995; Greene et al . , 1998; Montgomery et al . , 1999; Swain and Gierasch , 2006; Swain et al . , 2007; Smock et al . , 2010; Zhuravleva and Gierasch , 2015; Zhuravleva et al . , 2012; Moro et al . , 2003; Moro et al . , 2004; Taneva et al . , 2010; Mayer et al . , 2000; Laufen et al . , 1999 ) , and it was therefore selected for initial experiments . The ATP state of DnaK is an important entry point for substrates to the Hsp70 chaperone cycle ( Pierpaoli et al . , 1998 ) and was chosen as the chaperone nucleotide state in this study . In the ATP state DnaK substrate complexes have millisecond lifetimes and have been previously studied with CEST methodology ( Sekhar et al . , 2015 ) . In all experiments involving DnaK/ATP , the allosterically active T199A mutant of DnaK ( McCarty and Walker , 1991 ) that is deficient in ATP hydrolysis was used to minimize ATP turnover during NMR data collection . Figure 3C shows the Met methyl region of a 13C-1H HMQC spectrum of 250 \u03bcM U-2H , Ile\u03b41-13CH3 , Leu/Val-13CH3/12CD3 , Met-13CH3 ( ILVM-13CH3 ) labeled R17* , 25\u00b0C . There are two Met residues in R17* and five resonances in the spectral region . Three of the peaks were assigned to Met 87 and two to Met 26 based on the 13C-1H HMQC spectrum of M26L R17* ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . In addition , we carried out a temperature titration of R17* to gradually unfold the protein so as to ascertain whether the extra peaks arise from its unfolded state . Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B shows that only two of the resonances remain in a 13C-1H HMQC spectrum recorded at 45\u00b0C and these are therefore assigned to the unfolded state of R17 . The other three resonances derive from the native conformer , with the weaker resonance from Met 87 ( M87NB ) possibly originating from an R17* dimer that is detected on the size exclusion column during purification . Upon addition of 500 \u03bcM U-2H DnaK/ATP a new peak appears in the Met region of the 13C-1H HMQC spectrum that can be unambiguously assigned to the bound state of R17* ( Figure 3D ) . The binding of R17* to DnaK can also be established from the 13C-1H HMQC spectrum of a sample prepared as 400 \u03bcM ILVM-13CH3 R17* and 800 \u03bcM I-13CH3 DnaK/ADP in which a number of new peaks are observed for the key Ile 401 and Ile 438 residues present at the central binding pocket of DnaK that are sensitive reporters of the binding event ( Rosenzweig et al . , 2017 ) ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 , middle ) . The presence of several Ile 401 and Ile 438 resonances at distinct chemical shifts in the bound state demonstrates the existence of multiple bound conformations of the R17*-DnaK complex , interconverting with each other and with free DnaK in slow exchange on the NMR chemical shift timescale . Such conformational heterogeneity in DnaK-substrate interactions , observed previously in studies focused on the three-helix bundle client hTRF1 ( Rosenzweig et al . , 2017 ) , arises from the binding of DnaK to a number of sites on R17* that position different aliphatic hydrophobic amino acids of the client at the central groove of the DnaK binding site ( referred to as the 0 position ) . Indeed , the DnaK binding site prediction algorithm LIMBO ( Van Durme et al . , 2009 ) identifies at least two regions on R17* with a high propensity to interact with DnaK , 42QGLLKKH48 and 70EDLIKKN76 ( Figure 3B ) , each of which has two hydrophobic residues ( L44 and L45 in region 1 and L72 and I73 in region 2 ) that could occupy the central cavity . Notably , substitution of the Leu pair at positions 44 and 45 with Ile leads to the appearance of new correlations in the Ile region of a 13C-1H HMQC spectrum recorded on a 200 \u03bcM ILVM-13CH3\u00a0L44I/L45I\u00a0R17* sample to which 400 \u03bcM 2H DnaK/ADP has been added , confirming that the region containing residues 42\u201348 is a DnaK binding site . We have not been able to confirm DnaK binding to the second predicted site , as substitution of Leu 72 with Ile did not yield additional correlations in the Ile region of a spectrum recorded on a suitably prepared R17* , DnaK/ADP sample . In order to determine whether the new resonance in the HMQC spectrum of the R17*-DnaK complex belongs to a Met residue at the 0 position of the DnaK binding site we measured intermolecular NOEs between ILVM-13CH3 R17* and I-13CH3 DnaK/ADP ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Here the ADP state of DnaK is used as it has higher affinity for substrates and the complex has lower koff rates ( Mayer and Bukau , 2005 ) . Previous X-ray and NMR structures of a variety of different complexes have established that Ile 401 and Ile 438 in the DnaK binding pocket are within 5 \u00c5 of the methyl moiety of the substrate residue located at position 0 ( Zhu et al . , 1996; Zahn et al . , 2013; Stevens et al . , 2003 ) and NOEs have been used to link Ile 401 , Ile 438 cross peaks with those from substrate residues that belong to the same conformation ( Rosenzweig et al . , 2017 ) . For R17* the bound Met methyl does not show NOE cross-peaks to Ile 401 and Ile 438 of DnaK , establishing that this Met residue is not located at the 0 position ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 , left ) . However , NOE cross-peaks can be observed connecting pairs of Ile 401 and Ile 438 residues ( labeled as 'a' and 'b' ) with their substrate counterparts whose methyls are localized to the Leu region of the HMQC spectrum , establishing that at least two distinct Leu residues of R17* can be present at the DnaK 0 position in the R17*-DnaK ensemble ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 , right ) . A number of biophysical studies using different spectroscopies such as NMR , fluorescence and circular dichroism have shown that DnaK-bound substrates are globally unfolded ( Palleros et al . , 1994; Chen et al . , 2006; Sharma et al . , 2010; Kellner et al . , 2014; Lee et al . , 2015; Sekhar et al . , 2015 ) . In order to determine the conformation of R17* in its DnaK-bound state we have compared the intensities of cross-peaks in 13C-1H HMQC spectra derived from native and unfolded states of R17* as probes . The intensities of native state Met and Ile resonances decrease by a factor of 1 . 6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 1 upon DnaK binding , consistent with solution equilibria shifting from N , and also with different 1H and 13C chemical shifts of R17* in the bound state from those in N . In contrast , intensities of Ile and Met correlations derived from the unfolded state increase by 2 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 6 fold . The simplest interpretation of the data is that the Met and Ile residues of R17* in bound conformations have the same chemical shifts as U , with the degeneracy in shifts leading to an increase , rather than a decrease in unfolded peak intensities . This provides strong evidence that R17* is globally unfolded in the DnaK-bound state . The distinct 13C and 1H chemical shifts from the Met peak labeled 'Bound' in Figure 3D ( assigned as Met 26 , see below ) , that are not unfolded-like , reflect a conformation of R17*-DnaK whereby the Met is proximal to the DnaK binding site and hence shifted from the random coil region of the spectrum . Taken together , our data shows that DnaK-bound R17* is globally unfolded and resembles the U conformation of R17* that exists in equilibrium with N in the absence of DnaK . Having established that the bound form of R17* is structurally very similar to U we next turned to studying the binding reaction using zz-exchange magnetization transfer . This experiment is particularly powerful in the case of R17* because both the 1H and 13C chemical shifts of the one Met resonance that reports on the bound state are distinct from those derived from N and U , and the Met region of the 13C-1H HMQC spectrum is well resolved , facilitating the detection and quantification of cross-peaks between states . Figure 4A shows a 2D plane from the zz-exchange dataset acquired with a mixing time of 300 ms . A pair of cross-peaks can be observed , labeled 1 and 2 , connecting the unfolded state of Met 26 with the bound state and assigning the bound resonance to the methyl group of Met 26 . Notably , there are no cross-peaks between N and the bound state , unequivocally demonstrating that DnaK interacts predominantly with the unfolded state of R17* . In order to obtain the binding and release rate constants for the reaction , U\u21cckBUkUBUK , we measured diagonal ( unfolded and bound ) and cross-peak intensities for Met 26 as a function of mixing time values that ranged from 25 to 800 ms and fit the resulting profiles globally to extract kUB and kBU values of 0 . 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 1 s\u22121 and 2 . 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 2 s\u22121 , respectively ( Figure 4B ) . One dimensional reduced \u03c72 surfaces show that both rate constants can be obtained reliably from the exchange dataset ( Figure 4C ) , with errors in the pseudo-first order rate constant kUB and the first order constant kBU estimated by a bootstrapping procedure ( Efron and Tibshirani , 1986 ) , described in Materials and methods ( Figure 4D ) . On the basis of the relative fractional populations of N and U ( pN/pU ) , as estimated from the first plane of the pseudo-3D zz-exchange dataset with TMIX\u00a0=\u00a025 ms ( 1 . 8:1 ) along with pU/pB ( =kBU/kUB ) values from the time-dependent zz-exchange data ( 3 . 4:1 ) pN , pU and pB ( bound fraction ) are calculated to be 58 \u00b1 2% , 33 \u00b1 1% and 9 \u00b1 2% , respectively . From the total DnaK concentration of 500 \u03bcM in the sample the bimolecular rate constant for the binding reaction is calculated to be konUB=kUB/[DnaK]=1600\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0250 M\u22121s\u22121 . Note that this value is an underestimate because there are several bound conformations in solution ( see discussion above ) and we only focus here on the process for which the cross-peak of Met 26 of the bound state is resolved . Other complexes for which the Met 26 cross-peaks of the bound state are degenerate with the unfolded state are invisible to this analysis . Because there are no cross-peaks between states N and B only upper-estimates of kNB and kBN rates can be obtained by assuming that the N-B cross-peaks are at the noise level . Computations were performed , following the description outlined previously ( Huang et al . , 2016 ) , where relative intensities of the N and B diagonal-peaks and the N-B cross-peaks are calculated using experimentally measured values of relaxation times for longitudinal order , as a function of kNB and kBN . Upper bounds for kUN and kNU were calculated in a similar manner as for kNB , kBN since exchange-based cross-peaks reporting on the U , N interconversion are absent as well . The values for all of the rate constants ( including upper bounds in some cases ) are illustrated in Figure 4E that shows the R17* binding mechanism . The flux along the CS pathway is theoretically defined as the sum of fluxes for all pathways leading to the bound state via U that do not involve the NK\u2192UK transition . Similarly , the net flux through the IF pathway is the sum of the flux values for all paths that do not involve the U\u2192UK step . In practice , however , the U\u2194N transition is very slow for R17* with an upper bound of 0 . 01 s\u22121 for kex , UN so that the dominant flux contribution along the CS pathway derives from the U\u2192UK transition while an upper bound for the IF pathway ( N\u2192NK\u2192UK ) can be estimated from the absence of an N , UK cross-peak . The relative partitioning of the flux along the CS ( FCS ) and IF ( FIF ) paths , \u0398 , is thus defined as\u0398=FCSFIF=konUB[DnaK][U]konNB[DnaK][N]=kUBkNBpUpN From kUB\u00a0=\u00a00 . 8 s\u22121 and kNB\u00a0<0 . 004 s\u22121 , as well as pN/pU\u00a0=\u00a01 . 8 , \u0398\u00a0>113 . Flux measurements thus confirm that the mechanism of R17* binding to DnaK is overwhelmingly biased in favour of CS ( Figure 4E ) . A histogram of the quantified flux values for the U\u2192UK ( lower bound ) , N\u2192U\u2192UK and N\u2192NK\u2192UK\u00a0pathways ( only upper bounds ) is presented in Figure 4F . Having established that the binding of the \u03b1-helical bundle domain R17* to DnaK proceeds through a CS mechanism we next addressed the dependence of binding on the secondary structure of the client protein by choosing the incomplete 5-stranded \u03b2-barrel SH3 domain of the Drosophila melanogaster Enhancer of sevenless 2B protein ( drkN SH3 , Figure 5A , B ) as a client . DrkN SH3 is a slow-folding protein with kex , UN\u00a0~\u00a01 s\u22121 , 20\u00b0C , and is marginally stable , populating a significant fraction of U at equilibrium ( pN/pU\u00a0~\u00a02 , pH 6 . 0 , 20\u00b0C ) ( Farrow et al . , 1994; Tollinger et al . , 2001 ) . Previous studies have established that the DnaK bound state of drkN SH3 is structurally similar to U ( Lee et al . , 2015 ) . Figure 5 shows the methyl spectrum of 250 \u03bcM IM-13CH3 drkN SH3 without ( C ) , and with ( D ) 500 \u03bcM U-2H DnaK/ATP . The binding of SH3 to DnaK can be clearly visualized through the appearance of at least four new peaks , labeled 1\u20134 in Figure 5D . Two of these , 1 and 2 , are particularly intense and separated in the 1H dimension from other resonances derived from the N and U states of drkN SH3 . The 13C-1H HMQC spectrum of a sample of 500 \u03bcM IM-13CH3 DnaK/ADP and 250 \u03bcM ILVM-13CH3 drkN SH3 is shown in Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ( middle ) . There are at least three new resonances for each of the DnaK binding site residues Ile 401 and Ile 438 when drkN SH3 is present , confirming that the SH3 domain binds to the canonical binding pocket on DnaK and highlighting the conformational heterogeneity in the SH3-DnaK ensemble , as has been seen in all other folding competent clients that we have studied to date . The identity of the residues of drkN SH3 at position 0 of the DnaK binding pocket have been obtained by recording a 3D 13C-edited NOESY dataset on the same sample ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Notably , there are NOEs connecting the two Ile peaks 1 and 2 of drkN SH3 to Ile 438 of the chaperone , indicating that peaks 1 and 2 arise from Ile at the 0 position of the DnaK binding site . In contrast , NOEs from Leu residues in drkN SH3 to Ile 401 and Ile 438 are not observed . The absence of Leu residues at the binding site may possibly account for the low affinity of drkN SH3 for DnaK , even in the high affinity binding state where DnaK is ADP loaded . Cavagnero and coworkers report a KD of 243 \u03bcM for drkN SH3 and DnaK/ADP ( Lee et al . , 2015 ) that is at least two orders of magnitude weaker than literature values for peptides or proteins where Leu residues can occupy position 0 ( Pierpaoli et al . , 1998 ) . While the 1H chemical shifts of the bound Ile peaks 1 and 2 from drkN SH3 are unique , their 13C shifts are nearly degenerate with those from Ile 27 and Ile 4 of the N state , respectively , ( Figure 5D ) which complicates the quantification of potential N-B cross-peaks in a zz-exchange dataset . Thus , we have measured 1H CEST spectra to obtain the kinetics of drkN SH3 binding to DnaK/ATP using the pulse sequence shown in Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A . Our choice of exploiting the 1H nucleus in CEST studies is motivated by the fact that the largest chemical shift differences between folded , unfolded and bound state peaks in methyl-based 13C-1H HMQC datasets of drkN SH3 are in the 1H dimension . However , 1H CEST can be prone to artifacts arising from NOE effects that lead to spurious minor dips that do not report on conformational exchange ( Sekhar et al . , 2016; Bouvignies and Kay , 2012 ) . In order to minimize these NOE-dips we have used highly deuterated I-13CH3 labeled drkN SH3 for acquiring CEST data and fortunately , there are only two pairs of Ile residues that are within 5 \u00c5 , considerably reducing the number of possible NOE dips . Finally , the mixing time during which exchange is quantified was set to 150 ms , a reasonably small value that further minimizes the sizes of these spurious dips . In principle it is possible to eliminate NOE effects completely using a spin-state selective 1H CEST scheme that has been proposed recently ( Yuwen et al . , 2017 ) . However , this comes at a considerable cost in sensitivity ( more than a\u00a0factor of two ) and since signal-to-noise is limiting in applications involving very slowly exchanging conformers ( see below ) or when short mixing times are selected we have chosen not to use this approach here . In order to interpret CEST profiles it was necessary to first assign peaks 1 and 2 to specific Ile residues in drkN SH3 . This was achieved using a zz-exchange experiment that links peaks 1 and 2 to the corresponding U state correlations , that were already assigned by traditional NMR methods . In this way we could show that peaks 1 and 2 are derived from Ile 53 and Ile 27 , respectively ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Since we know from NOE data that both peaks 1 and 2 are present at the 0 position , it follows that peaks 1 and 2 report on two distinct DnaK-bound conformations of drkN SH3 , labeled as B1 and B2 respectively . In the B1 conformer Ile 53 is at the 0 position while in B2 the 0 position is occupied by Ile 27 . Figure 6 shows 1H CEST profiles from Ile 27 and Ile 53 methyl groups of folded ( A , D ) , unfolded ( B , E ) and DnaK-bound ( C , F ) drkN SH3 , acquired on a sample with 250 \u03bcM IM-13CH3 drkN SH3 and 500 \u03bcM U-2H-DnaK/ATP . Recall that in CEST spectra measured by recording the intensity of a peak from state j as a function of irradiation frequency the major dip derives from that state , while minor dips link state j with other states in the exchanging network . The native state CEST profiles of both Ile 27 and Ile 53 show only one minor dip each , at the resonances frequencies of the corresponding 1H\u03b41 shifts in their respective unfolded states . These minor dips result from the U-N conformational exchange . However , the corresponding CEST traces from both residues in U show minor dips to N as well as to the bound state , unambiguously demonstrating that the major flux for the binding reaction involves a pathway whereby DnaK selects the unfolded state of drkN SH3 . This conclusion is reinforced by CEST profiles of the bound state peaks where only one strong minor dip is observed in each trace that links the bound state with U . In contrast to DnaK/ATP , the CEST profiles of drkN SH3 bound to DnaK/ADP do not show any signature of binding/release ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B ) , though the presence of the bound states B1 and B2 can clearly be discerned from 13C-1H HMQC spectra recorded on the same sample . This is a consequence of the slow rates of substrate release from DnaK/ADP ( ~0 . 001 s\u22121 , 25\u00b0C ) ( Mayer and Bukau , 2005; Pierpaoli et al . , 1998 ) , which places the exchange process outside the window of detection via CEST methods ( Vallurupalli et al . , 2017 ) . The presence of CEST minor dips with DnaK/ATP and not with DnaK/ADP also confirms that DnaK is predominantly in the ATP-bound form in the sample used for acquiring CEST data in Figure 6 . Analysis of the 1H CEST profiles for the drkN SH3 system is challenging because of the measurable exchange between U and N , and U and UK , and by the presence of two bound states . Accordingly , we fit the CEST profiles from the Ile 27 and Ile 53 N and U peaks , as well as the profiles of I53B1 and I27B2 peaks globally to the four-state model shown in Figure 7 . The intermediate state along the IF pathway , corresponding to NK , is not included in the model because there is no evidence from 13C-1H HMQC spectra of SH3/DnaK samples or from the CEST profiles justifying the explicit inclusion of such a state; instead , the three-state N-NK-UK pathway was approximated as N-UK . The rate constants and populations that have been obtained from our modeling analysis are shown in Figure 7 . The reliability of the kinetics parameters was evaluated by generating 1D reduced \u03c72 surfaces as a function of each of the eight global variables ( 5 rates , 3 populations; Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . These show pronounced minima for all five rate constants kex , UB1 , kex , NB1 , kex , UB2 , kex , NB2 and kex , UN . However , the minima are very shallow and broad for the populations , indicating that only the rate constants and not the populations can be obtained reliably from the CEST data . The flux ratio \u0398 for the U\u2192UK and N\u2192UK pathways based on the simultaneous fit of CEST profiles from Ile 27 and Ile 53 is given by\u0398=konUB[DnaK][U]konNB[DnaK][N]=kex , UB ( pBpU+pB ) pUkex , NB ( pBpN+pB ) pN=kex , UBkex , NB\u039ewhere kex , UB and kex , NB for both the B1 and B2 arms of the binding scheme of Figure 7 can be obtained reliably . In order to estimate \u039e , we fit the CEST data using a bootstrap procedure ( Efron and Tibshirani , 1986 ) described in Materials and methods; the resulting distribution of \u039e values is narrow and centred around\u00a0~1 , with 98% of the values falling within the range of 0 . 84\u20131 . 27 for state B1 ( Ile 53 at the 0 position ) and 0 . 49\u20131 . 57 for B2 ( Ile 27 at the 0 position ) ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The average and standard deviation of the \u039e\u00a0distribution are 1 . 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 1 and 1 . 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 2 for the B1 and B2 arms respectively . This implies that \u0398 is well approximated by the ratio kex , UB/kex , NB . Rate constants and their errors , as reported in Figure 7 , are listed as the means and standard deviations of the respective distributions obtained from a bootstrapping analysis . Using these values , \u03981 and \u03982 for the formation of bound states B1 and B2 corresponding to Ile 53 and Ile 27 of drkN SH3 at position 0 of DnaK are found to be 4 and 21 respectively . Figure 7B and C show histograms of flux values for U\u2192UK , N\u2192U\u2192UK and N\u2192UK pathways . The flux through N\u2192NK\u2192UK\u00a0could not be estimated because NK correlations are not observed , but an upper bound is given by the flow through\u00a0N\u2192UK . Thus our data strongly support the notion that the dominant flux is through the U\u2192UK pathway whereby DnaK directly selects the U state , and therefore the binding mechanism can be described according to the CS model . The Hsp70 family of chaperones are integral to the quality control machinery in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans and the Hsp70 client binding site sequence and architecture have been highly conserved through evolution . We thus wondered if the mechanism of client substrate recognition by Hsp70 is also conserved and whether a CS mode of binding might also apply to other Hsp70 chaperones . To this end we choose the constitutively expressed human Hsc70 for study and focused on the drkN SH3 substrate . Upon addition of 500 \u03bcM U-2H , Hsc70/ATP to a solution of 170 \u03bcM IM-13CH3 drkN SH3 , no new peaks were observed ( Figure 8A , B ) , suggesting that the affinity of drkN SH3 for Hsc70/ATP is lower than that for DnaK/ATP ( Figure 5 ) . A reduced affinity would lower the population of UK and in the present case render it invisible to study by traditional NMR methods . For applications of this sort CEST is particularly powerful because the signals from sparsely populated protein conformations can be amplified by detecting them through NMR visible states ( Vallurupalli et al . , 2017 ) . Figure 8C , D shows 1H CEST profiles derived from Ile 27 of N and U drkN SH3 . Similar to our observations with DnaK , the native state CEST profile ( red ) shows a minor dip at the frequency of Ile 27 H\u03b41 in the unfolded state , while the unfolded state profile ( green ) shows a pair of dips , with one at the position of the native state for Ile 27 H\u03b41 and a second , initially unassigned . There are several lines of evidence that strongly indicate that the unassigned minor dip arises from Hsc70-bound drkN SH3 . First the chemical shift of the dip , 0 . 35 ppm , is close to 0 . 2 ppm that was measured for the DnaK bound states B1 and B2 ( Figure 5 ) . Second , when CEST profiles are recorded of drkN SH3 bound to DnaK/ADP , where the exchange kinetics are much slower than for the ATP loaded chaperone form and too slow to observe exchange derived dips ( see above ) , a minor dip in the region between 0 . 2\u20130 . 4 ppm is not observed in the unfolded state CEST profile ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B , middle ) . Finally , a 13C-1H HMQC spectrum recorded after leaving the sample for approximately 2 days at room temperature , sufficient time for Hsc70/ATP to convert to Hsc70/ADP , shows a new peak at the 1H chemical shift of the minor dip , 0 . 35 ppm . This new peak belongs to Hsc70/ADP-bound drkN SH3 and is now visible because Hsc70/ADP has a higher affinity for substrate than Hsc70/ATP and the population of the bound state is higher . Notably , in the N state CEST profile a small broad peak is observed at the position of Ile 27 H\u03b41 in the bound state ( ~0 . 35 ppm ) . This dip is not the result of exchange between N and UK but can be attributed , instead , to an NOE between proximal residues Ile 27 and Ile 48 in the native drkN SH3 state and the fact that the bound state H\u03b41 chemical shift for Ile 27 is degenerate with the 1H Ile \u03b41 shift of residue 48 in the native state . Confirmation that this is an NOE dip and not due to exchange is obtained by measuring CEST profiles of drkN SH3 bound to DnaK/ADP where an NOE dip is observed as well ( Figure 8E ) but , as discussed above , where the rates of binding/release are too slow for the development of minor dips resulting from exchange and by the observation of a distinct NOE crosspeak between Ile 27 and Ile 48 in a 3D 13C-13C-1H NOESY spectrum of ILVM-13CH3 drkN SH3 . Taken together our results thus confirm that the major flux to UK proceeds through U so that human Hsc70 also employs a CS mode of interaction with the drkN SH3 client protein . As a final note , we have chosen not to quantify fluxes in this case because a bound state profile could not be obtained ( peaks from the bound state are not observed in spectra ) and because of the potential for contamination from NOE dips . \n The Hsp70 chaperone plays a ubiquitous role in maintaining cellular proteostasis by recognizing and modulating the structure of its client proteins in an ATP-dependent manner to effect a variety of downstream functions that include protein folding , translocation and oligomer disassembly ( Balchin et al . , 2016 ) . Structures of Hsp70 bound to a number of different peptide substrates have appeared ( Zhu et al . , 1996; Zahn et al . , 2013; Stevens et al . , 2003; Clerico et al . , 2015 ) and both biochemical and biophysical studies of Hsp70 with folding competent protein domains and intact proteins have been reported ( Kellner et al . , 2014; Lee et al . , 2015; Sekhar et al . , 2015; Sekhar et al . , 2016; Rodriguez et al . , 2008; Sekhar et al . , 2012a; Sekhar et al . , 2012b ) . However , the coupling between chaperone binding and substrate conformational changes remains poorly understood . Understanding the mechanisms by which flexible molecules bind their targets has been the focus of considerable attention in the literature ( Boehr et al . , 2009; Rauh et al . , 2004; Zhang et al . , 2007; Mittag et al . , 2010 ) . In general , such molecules exist in an array of different interconverting conformations in solution at equilibrium , yet binding to a protein generally selects one of the states over the others . In principle , NMR spectroscopy is a valuable tool for obtaining mechanistic information about the binding process if the kinetics happen to be in a regime that is amenable to the methodology . In the case of zz-exchange this requirement puts exchange rates on the order of 1 s\u22121 or larger , although in some cases significantly slower timescales have been studied using methionine methyl probes with very slow longitudinal relaxation rates ( Religa et al . , 2010 ) . The CEST experiment , in general , is most sensitive to slightly faster processes with rates of at least 20\u201330 s\u22121 , but in the present application accurate estimates for rates of\u00a0~1 s\u22121 could be obtained because profiles derived from spins in all of the interconverting states could be measured . An elegant illustration of the utility of NMR in this regard was provided close to forty years ago in studies by Birdsall and coworkers using a one-dimensional analogue of the CEST approach described here ( Birdsall et al . , 1980 ) . The authors were able to demonstrate that the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) selects one conformation of folinic acid , a product of the reaction with tetrahydrofolate that is catalyzed by DHFR , over a second , under conditions where both conformations exist in roughly equal proportions in solution in the absence of enzyme . Here we have extended this work by using state of the art NMR methods that include relaxation optimized techniques for recording spectra of methyl group probes ( methyl TROSY ) in high molecular weight complexes ( Rosenzweig and Kay , 2014 ) and two-dimensional spin relaxation experiments such as CEST ( Vallurupalli et al . , 2017 ) and magnetization exchange ( Farrow et al . , 1994; Palmer et al . , 2001 ) to probe the binding reaction of Hsp70 with cognate substrates . It is increasingly recognized that protein molecules , much like simpler small organic compounds such as folinic acid , exist in solution as an equilibrium mixture between multiple conformations , and that these diverse conformers may in some cases have different functional properties , including different propensities for binding to ligands . The targets of Hsp70 include an array of different protein substrates and elucidating what , if any , common structural features are recognized by the chaperone during the initial stages of binding to these targets would represent an important contribution towards understanding the overall binding mechanism . We have studied the binding reaction of Hsp70 from E . coli ( DnaK ) to a pair of substrates with very different secondary structures , including the three-helical bundle domain R17* from chicken-brain \u03b1-spectrin and the all \u03b2-sheet SH3 domain from the Drosophila adaptor protein Drk . Both of these protein domains exist in solution as an equilibrium between N and U states , with peaks from each conformer observed in 13C-1H correlation datasets so that probes are available that can report on preferred chaperone binding to either of these two predominant solution conformations . Relaxation based experiments establish that in both cases the dominant flux to the bound state , in which the substrate is unfolded in complex with DnaK ( Lee et al . , 2015 ) , proceeds through the single step binding reaction U \u2192UK as opposed to any scheme in which binding to N is the first step in an NK to UK transition . In order to obtain insight into whether the DnaK binding mechanism is conserved among different Hsp70 orthologs we have carried out further studies using the constitutively expressed human Hsc70 protein and the drkN SH3 substrate . Notably , peaks from the bound state were not observed in spectra , reflecting the low affinity of the complex . However , an excited state dip was observed in the 1H CEST profile of Ile 27 H\u03b41 in U that could be assigned to the \u2018invisible\u2019 bound state , while a corresponding peak from chemical exchange was not observed for N . This establishes that the flux to the Hsc70 bound state , like that for DnaK , also proceeds via a U \u2192UK mechanism . It is worth noting that all of the flux measurements described here were done at equilibrium , with the stability of samples monitored by recording a series of 13C-1H correlation maps at different time points . It is , of course , possible to envision non-equilibrium measurements where the relative importance of different fluxes change over time as populations of states vary during the course of reactions , but this was not the case for the equilibrium studies conducted here . Our data thus point to the conformational selection model as a good descriptor of Hsp70-ligand binding , at least for the substrates and chaperones that are considered in the present study . It is important to emphasize that the analysis of flux through IF and CS pathways discussed here is somewhat different than what is typically described in the literature where a comparison of fluxes through N\u2192U\u2192UK ( CS ) and N\u2192NK\u2192UK ( IF ) pathways exclusively is made , without considering binding proceeding directly from other equilibrium states ( U in this case ) ( Hammes et al . , 2009; Weikl and Paul , 2014; Vogt and Di Cera , 2012 ) . Here we have considered proteins as equilibrium ensembles , with binding reactions proceeding from any member of the ensemble , rather than focusing exclusively on the N conformer as the initial state . An analysis that includes the possibility of fluxes from any of the existing equilibrium states of a protein in solution is required for distinguishing between different mechanisms of binding . In the case here U is thermally accessible from N and is significantly populated at equilibrium , with the N\u2192U\u2192UK reaction contributing only a small amount to the net flux by which UK is formed relative to the U\u2192UK pathway for the substrates and Hsp70 chaperones considered . The preference of Hsp70 for the unfolded state of the substrates demonstrates a 'holdase' recognition mechanism whereby Hsp70 captures intrinsic fluctuations in its client protein . Our results argue against a simple N\u2192NK\u2192UK\u00a0unfoldase scheme as a dominant binding mechanism , where the native state of the substrate is recognized by Hsp70 and induced to unfold upon binding . However , it must be emphasized that we have focused on elementary binding steps here and our results are not inconsistent with broader unfoldase mechanisms involving recognition of partially unfolded or misfolded regions of substrates that eventually result in unfolded Hsp70-bound clients via a multistep process . For example , such a mechanism may be operative in the conversion of a misfolded state of luciferase to a globally unfolded , folding-competent ensemble ( Sharma et al . , 2010 ) where the elementary binding step is a holdase-like CS reaction , U \u2192UK , involving trapping by Hsp70 of local conformational fluctuations occurring in a small region of the protein . A CS-based mechanism for Hsp70-substrate interactions is consistent with expectations based on Hsp70 function . First , such a binding mode ensures that Hsp70 will not randomly unfold properly folded and functional cellular proteins . Second , a number of cognate Hsp70 substrates such as nascent polypeptides synthesized on the ribosome ( Teter et al . , 1999 ) and proteins translocated across membranes ( Pilon and Schekman , 1999 ) are unfolded and would therefore be poised for binding to Hsp70 . Third , the CS binding mode ensures that Hsp70 will select only misfolded intermediates lacking stable secondary and tertiary structure for refolding rather than stably folded native conformations with exposed hydrophobic sidechains so that refolding occurs in a unidirectional manner from the misfolded to the native state . Finally , Hsp70 recognition sites on proteins such as \u03c332 that bind in their native state are in long solvent-exposed loop regions ( Rodriguez et al . , 2008 ) where both sidechain and backbone motifs of the binding site residues are available for interaction . It should also be noted that there are likely to be small differences in structure between the Hsp70-bound ( UK ) and the globally unfolded state ( U ) of substrates . Indeed , conformational sampling in the bound state is expected to be different from the globally unfolded state because each Hsp70 molecule divides the substrate into two distinct polypeptide segments at the binding site . We have shown earlier that tertiary interactions that are transiently present in the U state of the unbound substrate are disrupted across the Hsp70 binding site ( Sekhar et al . , 2016 ) , so that the two segments could have different overall structural propensities than would be the case for the full-length protein in its unfolded state . We cannot determine through our measurements whether in this case these small changes have occurred as a result of binding ( IF ) or prior to it ( CS ) . Instead , our conclusions of CS being the prevalent mechanism , therefore , pertain to binding events involving interactions of the chaperone with states that have larger conformational differences such as N and U . The multiple Hsp70-bound conformations of R17* and drkN SH3 noted in this study reinforce our previous observations with the three-helix bundle substrate hTRF1 that Hsp70 binds promiscuously to its substrates , recognizing different sites containing aliphatic hydrophobic residues along the polypeptide sequence ( Rosenzweig et al . , 2017 ) . Our results show that each binding site of the substrate can be recognized by Hsp70 when it becomes exposed to the solvent in the thermally accessible unfolded state , highlighting the prominent role played by conformational dynamics in this crucial protein-protein interaction ."}

T cells are key components of the immune system , and each has a unique variant of a signalling complex known as the T cell receptor on its surface . T cells scan the surfaces of other cells in search of antigens , which are peptides ( fragments of proteins ) that derive from foreign pathogens such as viruses . Successful recognition of a foreign peptide leads to an immune response that , in most cases , ultimately rids the body of the pathogen . Most importantly , however , the immune system must be able to discriminate between peptides that are produced naturally in the body ( \u2018self\u2019 peptides ) and foreign or \u2018non-self\u2019 peptides . This is challenging because self peptides may have similar structures to non-self peptides and are often much more abundant . Many models have been proposed to explain how T cells are able to detect just a few molecules of foreign peptide . According to some hypotheses the T cell receptors get together in clusters to function cooperatively; alternatively , it has been suggested that rapid binding of a foreign peptide to multiple T cell receptors sequentially can build up a strong signal . However , none of these phenomena have been directly observed . O'Donoghue et al . now image the interactions between T cell receptors and peptides bound to molecules called major histocompatibility complexes ( MHCs ) , and show that T cell activation can occur when a single foreign peptide binds to a single receptor . These interactions are long-lived and ultimately result in the recruitment of ZAP70 , which has an important role in the activation of T cells , to the complex formed by the T cell , the peptide and the MHC molecule . Therefore , any amplification of the activating signal transmitted by non-self peptides occurs following receptor binding , in contrast to previous models .", "source": "T cells discriminate between self and foreign antigenic peptides , displayed on antigen presenting cell surfaces , via the TCR . While the molecular interactions between TCR and its ligands are well characterized in vitro , quantitative measurements of these interactions in living cells are required to accurately resolve the physical mechanisms of TCR signaling . We report direct single molecule measurements of TCR triggering by agonist pMHC in hybrid junctions between live primary T cells and supported lipid membranes . Every pMHC:TCR complex over the entire cell is tracked while simultaneously monitoring the local membrane recruitment of ZAP70 , as a readout of TCR triggering . Mean dwell times for pMHC:TCR molecular binding of 5 and 54 s were measured for two different pMHC:TCR systems . Single molecule measurements of the pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 complex indicate that TCR triggering is stoichiometric with agonist pMHC in a 1:1 ratio . Thus any signal amplification must occur downstream of TCR triggering . \n An essential aspect of adaptive immunity is the ability of T cells to discriminate between structurally similar agonist and non-stimulatory self peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex ( pMHC ) molecules presented on the surface of antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) ( Weiss and Littman , 1994 ) . Fewer than 10 agonist pMHC molecules can trigger T cells ( Irvine et al . , 2002; Manz et al . , 2011 ) , and the signaling response occurs on a timescale of seconds ( Huse et al . , 2007 ) . It has been recognized for decades that subtle , peptide-specific differences in binding parameters , especially kinetic rates for the pMHC and T cell receptor ( TCR ) reaction , seem to be the basis of antigen recognition ( Matsui et al . , 1994; Tian et al . , 2007 ) . Experimental correlations between molecular pMHC:TCR binding kinetics , typically determined from solution assays of soluble extracellular domains and bulk measurements of T cell activity , have provided the foundation for much of this understanding . From a physical point of view , the extreme sensitivity , selectivity , and apparent immunity to stochastic noise exhibited by TCR antigen recognition pose challenges to classical notions of ligand-receptor signaling ( van der Merwe and Dushek , 2011; Dustin and Groves , 2012 ) . For example , the maximum affinity a TCR can have for self pMHC ligands ( non-triggering ) is sharply defined and close to the affinity threshold for foreign pMHC ( triggering ) . Consequently , every TCR is likely to bind a subset of the ever-present self pMHC molecules with affinities differing only slightly from genuine foreign agonist pMHC . If TCR triggering and signaling were simply proportional to TCR occupancy by ligand , then the abundance of self pMHC could easily overwhelm genuine agonist signals , rendering this as an ineffective discriminatory mechanism . Alternatively , each engagement of pMHC with TCR ( serial triggering; Valitutti et al . , 1995 ) , perhaps with some minimum engagement time ( kinetic proof reading; McKeithan , 1995; Rabinowitz et al . , 1996 ) , might define the threshold for TCR triggering . Other proposed mechanisms elaborate further , suggesting ( pseudo ) heterodimers ( Irvine et al . , 2002; Krogsgaard et al . , 2005 ) of self and agonist pMHC molecules or pMHC-independent forms of trans activation ( Cooper and Qian , 2008 ) of multiple TCR by a single agonist pMHC may be at work . Proving or disproving any of these various possibilities based on current data is confounded by the vast difference between ensemble biochemical measurements and cell population behavior . Substantial ambiguity with respect to the actual molecular mechanisms responsible for antigen triggering of T cells remains . A physically accurate understanding of this remarkable process will require simultaneous observations of the molecular binding kinetics , stoichiometry , and movement of individual signaling complexes in living T cells . Here , we characterize the molecular interactions between pMHC and TCR , at the single molecule level , while simultaneously monitoring the local membrane recruitment of cytosolic Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 ( ZAP70 ) in live primary T cells . Every pMHC can be individually resolved and tracked for up to minutes before photobleaching by using a multi-timescale single molecule fluorescence imaging approach . Key to this strategy is the variable control of excitation light dose and exposure time to achieve hardware discrimination of molecular species with different mobilities . The pMHC molecules fall into two unambiguously distinguished classes: one undergoing fast random motion and the second moving slowly along linear trajectories . These slow moving pMHC are the bound pMHC:TCR complexes; they are only observed with agonist peptide and they spatially correlate with both TCR and recruitment of ZAP70 . The linear trajectories of the pMHC:TCR complexes match the well-characterized cytoskeleton-driven movement of TCR during the formation of the immunological synapse ( Campi et al . , 2005; Yokosuka et al . , 2005; DeMond et al . , 2008; Yu et al . , 2012 ) . Thus a lone agonist pMHC bound to TCR leads to stable engagement of the resulting complex with the cytoskeleton . Single molecule intensity calibration of the number of ZAP70 recruited to the vicinity of each agonist pMHC indicates that TCR are triggered in a 1:1 stoichiometry with pMHC . Associations of pMHC with TCR exhibited molecular binding dwell times with mean durations of 53 . 8 \u00b1 12 . 2 s and 5 . 2 \u00b1 0 . 2 s for AND and 5c . c7 TCRs , respectively . Individual dwell times are roughly exponentially distributed and are in general agreement with bulk solution measurements of pMHC:TCR kinetic off-rates for both TCRs ( Corse et al . , 2010; Huppa et al . , 2010; Newell et al . , 2011 ) . However , dwell times measured from tracking experiments specifically correspond to spatial entrapment of pMHC with a TCR , or cluster of TCRs ( Schamel and Alarcon , 2013 ) , on the T cell surface . They do not necessarily correspond to individual molecular binding events with a single TCR . Indeed , recent studies ( e . g . , by FRET ) have suggested that pMHC:TCR kinetic off-rates may be accelerated in living cells relative to in vitro measurements , possibly as a result of actively applied forces from the cytoskeleton ( Huang et al . , 2010; Huppa et al . , 2010; Zhu et al . , 2013 ) . We explore the possibility that individual dwell times observed by tracking experiments could be composed of rapid unbinding and serial rebinding of pMHC to multiple TCR within a cluster . Results from a stochastic reaction-diffusion analysis , covering a wide range of parameter space , indicate that serial rebinding alone is unlikely to sustain entrapment . If pMHC thoroughly disengages from TCR , it will most likely escape . Structural flexibility within the pMHC:TCR complex ( Adams et al . , 2011; Hawse et al . , 2012; Reboul et al . , 2012 ) could give rise to apparently fast kinetics ( e . g . , in FRET measurements ) without actual unbinding of pMHC from TCR . The tracking observations reported here directly reveal that the functional interaction between agonist pMHC and TCR is long-lived in living cells and that triggered TCR remain localized with the same pMHC . \n We probe agonist pMHC:TCR complex dynamics in hybrid live cell\u2014supported membrane junctions ( Grakoui et al . , 1999 ) ( Figure 1A ) . The supported membrane is functionalized with MHC ( IEk ) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 fusion with a blue fluorescent protein ( ICAM1-TagBFP ) , both linked to the membrane via C-terminal poly-His tag binding to Ni-chelating lipids ( Nye and Groves , 2008 ) . The MHC is loaded with peptide ( moth cytochrome c [MCC] agonist or null ) , which is covalently coupled in a 1:1 stoichiometry ( verified by HPLC ) to the photostable fluorophores Atto647N or Atto488 using maleimide-thiol chemistry . Upon contact between the T cell and the supported membrane , Leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 ( LFA1 ) -ICAM1 binding leads to rapid cell spreading and formation of an essentially planar interface between the T cell and supported membrane , within which pMHC:TCR interactions occur . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 003Figure 1 . Agonist pMHC binding to TCR in T cells is revealed by changes in mobility . ( A ) Schematic of the hybrid live cell\u2013SLB system . Binding of agonist pMHC to TCR ( PDB , 3QIU ) leads to phosphorylation of ITAMs , on the intracellular domain of the TCR , which is followed by recruitment of the kinase ZAP70 ( PDB , 2OQI , 2OZO ) . We directly observe both pMHC:TCR binding and ZAP70:ITAM recruitment using single molecule fluorescence microscopy ( bilayer adapted from Domanski et al . , 2010 ) . ( B ) At short exposure times ( 17 . 5 ms , left ) all agonist pMHC molecules are readily resolved . Imaging with a long exposure time ( 500 ms , right ) allows for unambiguous discrimination between the slow , TCR-bound fraction of agonist pMHC and the fast diffusing fraction . This also allows for long ( 1\u201310 s interval ) time-lapse sequences ( Video 1 ) . Automated detection of single molecule features ( red circles ) is discussed in methods . ( C ) Representative intensity trace showing a single agonist pMHC molecule , identified by step photobleaching , bound continuously for \u223c60 s . ( D ) Step size histogram of single agonist pMHC molecules in a SLB is bimodal under T cells ( red ) and unimodal before addition of T cells ( blue ) . pMHC molecules in ( B ) \u2013 ( D ) were labeled with Atto647N on the MCC peptide . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 003 At fast exposure times ( 17 . 5 ms ) and high excitation powers ( 0 . 2 W/cm2 ) , all pMHC molecules are readily resolved ( Figure 1B , left panel ) . The pMHC move as individual molecules , as identified by single-step photobleaching , and can be continuously tracked for up to hundreds of frames ( Figure 1C ) . In regions without a cell , pMHC exclusively exhibit random diffusive motion . The step-size distribution from these trajectories corresponds to a single lateral diffusion coefficient of 0 . 44 ( SEM = 0 . 002 ) \u00b5m2/s , which is typical for supported membranes ( Lin et al . , 2010 ) . Within the T cell junction , the step-size distribution becomes bimodal ( Figure 1D ) . In addition to a fast component from freely diffusing pMHC , a distinct slow-moving component also appears . At long exposure times ( 500 ms ) and low excitation powers ( 0 . 02 W/cm2 ) , the fast moving pMHC fraction in Figure 1D is averaged over several pixels to form a relatively homogenous background . The slow moving molecules remain highly localized and can be unambiguously tracked for longer than a minute , using 1\u201310 s time-lapses ( Figure 1B , right panel; Video 1 ) . The slow moving pMHC molecules colocalize with TCR ( Figure 2 ) and move in linear trajectories toward the geometric center of the live cell-supported membrane junction; these are the pMHC:TCR complexes . When MHC is loaded with a mixture of agonist and null peptides , with different fluorescent labels , only the agonist peptides are observed in the slow-moving complexes ( Figure 3 ) . The result is identical when the fluorophores are reversed , excluding the possibility that fluorophore effects could be responsible for binding . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 004Video 1 . A 3 s time-lapse video ( 189 frames ) of agonist pMHC interacting with live 5c . c7 T cells ( labeled with MCC-Atto488 ) . A long ( 500 ms ) exposure time allows for unambiguous discrimination between TCR-bound and unbound agonist pMHC in the bilayer . The hardware filtering approach utilized here facilitates particle detection in a relatively dense field of fluorophores , allowing for linking particles between frames even when long ( 1\u201310s ) time lapses are introduced . This technique also has the advantage of using only one probe , compared to other techniques for detecting ligand binding , such as smFRET , which require two different color probes to detect one molecular binding event . These advantages allow for simultaneous two color single molecule tracking and kinetics measurements . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 00410 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 005Figure 2 . TCR and MCC agonist pMHC colocalization . ( A ) and ( B ) TCR and agonist pMHC colocalize in bulk in the central supramolecular assembly cluster ( cSMAC ) and ( C ) at the single molecule level . Although TCR clusters were not readily observed in these experiments ( even using a 4 s camera integration time ) , previous reports indicate that TCR does cluster at the agonist density ( \u223c0 . 2 molecules/\u00b5m2 ) used here ( Varma et al . , 2006 ) . However , these reports used GPI-MHC , which is problematic because this GPI-linked protein is associated with clustering in supported membranes ( Manz et al . , 2011; Dustin and Groves , 2012 ) . The Ni2+-chelating lipids used in supported membranes for the experiments reported here have been shown to increase the likelihood that attached proteins are monodispersed ( Manz et al . , 2011; Xu et al . , 2011 ) , and this is confirmed by direct single molecule observation in our experiments .

RICM images map the footprint of T cell adhesion to the SLB ( mediated through LFA1:ICAM1 binding ) . T cells engage SLBs conjugated with mixtures of independently labeled MCC agonist and null peptide MHC . Only the MCC agonist pMHC is observed in the slow moving fraction , irrespective of which fluorescent label ( Atto488 or Atto647N ) it carries . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 006 The agonist pMHC densities used in these experiments range from 0 . 2 to 100 molecules/\u00b5m2 . The lowest densities are near thresholds for triggering Ca2+ flux ( Manz et al . , 2011 ) and below levels where stable TCR microclusters are readily visible ( Figure 2 ) , whereas the higher densities are well above the densities at which microclusters are observed ( Campi et al . , 2005; Yokosuka et al . , 2005; DeMond et al . , 2008; Yu et al . , 2012 ) . Nonetheless , the observed single molecule pMHC motion at all densities is reminiscent of the well-characterized actomyosin-driven TCR microcluster radial transport in cells that are activated ( Campi et al . , 2005; Yokosuka et al . , 2005; Kaizuka et al . , 2007; DeMond et al . , 2008; Yu et al . , 2012 ) . Two-color single molecule tracking is used to quantitatively monitor membrane recruitment of cytosolic ZAP70-EGFP ( incorporated by retroviral transfection ) to the locations of the pMHC:TCR complexes . Using a dual-view system in which chromatic aberrations have been mapped ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , spatial colocalization between the two channels to less than 105 nm is achieved . Immediately after cell landing , ZAP70 localizes to and moves together with the pMHC:TCR complexes ( Figure 4A; Videos 2 and 3 ) . For each frame in a tracking sequence , fluorescence intensity in the ZAP70-EGFP channel is integrated over a 315 nm square region centered on each pMHC:TCR complex ( Figure 4B ) . The resulting intensity traces reveal discrete changes in average intensity , which we attribute to the binding of one ZAP70-EGFP to the phosphorylated ITAM domains on the cytoplasmic side of TCR engaged with pMHC ( Iwashima et al . , 1994 ) . Representative traces of colocalized ZAP70-EGFP intensity along with the corresponding intensity trace from the pMHC are illustrated in Figure 4C . Stochastic transitions are identified using a change-point algorithm ( Ensign and Pande , 2009 ) and results from this analysis are superimposed on the raw intensity traces . Observed molecular binding dwell times of individual ZAP70-EGFP , as resolved by the stochastic transitions , range from 12 to 107 s . The majority of single molecule ZAP70-EGFP traces exhibit intensity fluctuations consistent with background ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A ) , which would not be expected if cytosolic ZAP70-EGFP exchanged during exposure time . These dwell times are slightly longer than estimates of \u223c10 s obtained from bulk fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments ( Bunnell et al . , 2002 ) . However , those experiments also identified a slower-exchanging fraction of ZAP70 that was not included in the average . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 007Figure 4 .

Raw data are included as Videos 2 and 3 . Data were recorded at 1 frame/s , such that each adjacent blue or red dot was recorded 1 s apart .

( A ) The majority of single molecule agonist pMHC traces result in ZAP70-EGFP traces with intensity fluctuations consistent with the background . Step increases and decreases in ZAP70-EGFP intensity are rare , but single ZAP70-EGFP events are long-lived ( 12\u2013107 s ) . Taken together , these observations indicate that rapid ZAP70-EGFP unbinding and rebinding in between observations is unlikely . If rapid unbinding/rebinding were to occur , then either single molecule ZAP70-EGFP traces would more frequent and shorter , or ZAP70-EGFP traces without single step intensity increases or decreases would be noisier . ( B ) A small minority of agonist pMHC traces exhibit two-step photobleaching , indicating pMHC dimerization . However , the ZAP70-EGFP output for these traces is equivalent to the ZAP70-EGFP output for single agonist pMHC single molecule traces . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 009 ZAP70-EGFP features brighter than single molecules are also observed and we calibrate their stoichiometries using single molecule ZAP70-EGFP intensities from the same cell . For example , the average ZAP70-EGFP feature intensity per frame ( 136 . 0 counts \u00b1 0 . 04 SEM , integrated over a 315 nm square area for each feature ) for the cell shown in Figure 4D corresponds to 2 . 9 \u00b1 0 . 04 SEM ZAP70-EGFP per feature , given that the single molecule intensity is 47 \u00b1 2 counts ( SEM; n = 6 ) in that cell . Each feature therefore contains on average \u223c6 ZAP70 molecules , since ZAP70-EGFP was expressed in a roughly 1:1 ratio with endogenous ZAP70 ( selected by FACS and confirmed by western blotting ) in these experiments . Each TCR complex has 10 ITAM domains that , when phosphorylated , can bind one ZAP70 each ( Weiss and Littman , 1994 ) . Thus observation of \u223c6 ZAP70 per agonist pMHC suggests only a single TCR is triggered . Brighter ZAP70-EGFP features tend to be located towards the geometric center of the cell at later time points ( >5\u201310 min after T cell landing ) . These can be tracked for tens to hundreds of seconds , indicating that recruited ZAP70-EGFP remain stably associated with the pMHC:TCR complex while traveling along the same linear trajectories ( Figure 4A; Videos 2 and 3 ) . The observation of a range of ZAP70-EGFP stoichiometries ( from 1 to \u223c10 ZAP70-EGFP per pMHC:TCR complex ) implies that some time-dependent accumulation of ZAP70 is likely to occur , although we have not definitively observed ZAP70-EGFP accumulation over time within individual intensity traces . Taken together , these observations demonstrate that engagement of TCR with an individual agonist pMHC molecule leads to stable association with the actin cytoskeleton , one-to-one TCR triggering ( ITAM phosphorylation ) , and subsequent ZAP70 recruitment . Moreover , since every pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 complex is individually resolved in these experiments , we demonstrate that a single pMHC:TCR complex can lead to TCR triggering without molecular-scale association with other MHC molecules . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 010Video 2 . Simultaneous observation of ZAP70-EGFP recruitment and pMHC:TCR binding immediately after a living AND T cell lands on the SLB .

These data were analyzed to create the spatial map of pMHC and ZAP70 positions displayed in Figure 4A . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 01010 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 011Video 3 . Simultaneous observation of ZAP70-EGFP recruitment and pMHC:TCR binding immediately after a living AND T cell lands on the SLB . This video shows binding of pMHC:TCR , and is from the same cell as the ZAP70-EGFP data in Video 2 . Agonist pMHC is labeled as MCC-Atto647N . These data were analyzed to create the spatial map of pMHC and ZAP70 positions displayed in Figure 4A . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 011 Since the slow-moving pMHC can be clearly resolved from the fast moving component , the lifetime of molecules in this bound state is directly observable . The minimum detectable lifetime is limited by the fastest frame rate ( 17 . 5 ms per frame ) and the maximum measureable lifetime is limited by photobleaching . For these single molecule tracking experiments , the temporal dynamic range spans from \u223c50 ms to \u223c5 min . Unbinding and photobleaching are indistinguishable in fluorescence methods such as this . For molecular binding , characterized by a constant kinetic off-rate , the distribution of observed dwell times , \u03c4obs , is described byf ( \u03c4obs ) = ( \u2329\u03c4bl\u232a\u22121+\u2329\u03c4off\u232a\u22121 ) e\u2212\u03c4obs ( \u2329\u03c4bl\u232a\u22121+\u2329\u03c4off\u232a\u22121 ) , where \u2329\u03c4bl\u232a\u22121 is the photobleaching rate ( kb ) , \u2329\u03c4off\u232a\u22121 is the unbinding rate ( koff ) , and ( \u2329\u03c4bl\u232a\u22121+\u2329\u03c4off\u232a\u22121 ) \u22121=\u2329\u03c4obs\u232a is the observed mean dwell time in this experiment . The observed dwell time distributions are roughly exponential , as is expected for molecular binding . Thus by measuring both kbl and \u2329\u03c4obs\u232a it is possible to determine \u2329\u03c4off\u232a as long as \u2329\u03c4obs\u232a\u2264\u2329\u03c4bl\u232a . We determine \u2329\u03c4off\u232a to be 53 . 8 \u00b1 12 . 2 s for AND and 5 . 2 \u00b1 0 . 2 s for 5c . c7 TCRs for Atto488-labeled peptide agonist with \u2329\u03c4bl\u232a of 300 and 30 s respectively ( Figure 5A , B ) . While fluorescent labels can affect binding kinetics , we measure similar values of \u2329\u03c4off\u232a with both Atto647N and Atto488 labeled peptides ( see , e . g . , Figures 1C , 3 , and 4A , C ) . \u2329\u03c4off\u232a is also relatively unchanged at high agonist pMHC density ( 100 molecules/\u00b5m2 ) , which is far above minimal levels required for T cell activation and observation of stable TCR microclusters ( Manz et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 5C ) . We observe that cytoskeleton disruption by the actin-binding molecule , Latrunculin A , moderately increases \u2329\u03c4off\u232a with the AND TCR and had no significant effect on 5c . c7 kinetics ( Figure 5C ) . Similarly , the dwell time distribution was only modestly affected by anti-CD4 ( data not shown ) ; however , the total number of TCR:pMHC complexes per cell was smaller in the anti-CD4 experiments , suggesting that the antibody interfered with pMHC:TCR binding . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 012Figure 5 . The distribution of live cell single molecule agonist pMHC:TCR molecular binding dwell times is observed directly . Measured dwell time distributions for both the 5c . c7 ( A ) and AND ( B ) TCRs are roughly exponential and match reported solution measurements . Bleaching times , kbl\u22121 , ( grey circles ) are measured using agonist pMHC SLB standards without cells and with the same fluorescent label ( Atto488 ) and are significantly longer than observed dwell times , \u03c4obs , for both TCRs . ( C ) Measured values for 5c . c7 and AND CD4+ T cells under varying conditions . Values in columns five and six represent \u223c300\u2013600 MCC agonist pMHC molecules per experimental condition from a population of 7\u201320 cells . Data are representative of at least 5 independent experiments performed on T cell blasts isolated from different mice for both the 5c . c7 and AND TCRs . Uncertainty in the average across different mice , shown in columns five and six , is calculated as the standard error of the mean of the molecular averages from different mice . In some cases ( e . g . for cytoskeleton disruption experiments with Latrunculin A ) one experiment ( representative of 7\u201310 cells and 100 s of single molecule measurements ) may be performed , but these data are always compared to a control sample recorded on the same day with T cell blasts from the same mouse . In these cases uncertainty is reported as the standard error of the mean of the molecular dwell time distribution . SPR measurements for 5c . c7 1 ( Huppa et al . , 2010 ) and AND-related 226 TCRs 2 ( Newell et al . , 2011 ) , along with single molecule FRET measurements for 5c . c7 1 ( Huppa et al . , 2010 ) , are shown for comparison . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 012 Tracking observations reveal the time intervals over which individual agonist pMHC molecules remain physically trapped within the immediate vicinity of the same TCR . Thus , although our measured dwell times in live cells are in general agreement with bulk solution measurements of pMHC:TCR kinetic off-rates for both TCRs ( Figure 5C ) ( Corse et al . , 2010; Newell et al . , 2011 ) , this may not result from the same reasons in each case . Unbinding of pMHC from TCR followed by rapid rebinding to the same TCR or another TCR within the same signaling cluster could conceivably lead to entrapment of pMHC for timescales longer than the lifetime of the molecular interaction . This has been hypothesized as a potential mode by which a small number of agonist pMHC could trigger a larger number of TCR ( Govern et al . , 2010; Huppa et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , recently reported single molecule measurements of pMHC:TCR binding kinetics in live cells , by force probe and by FRET , have suggested accelerated kinetic-off rates ( Huang et al . , 2010; Huppa et al . , 2010 ) . We investigate this further below . We quantitatively assess the possibility of serial rebinding of agonist pMHC to multiple TCR within a TCR cluster using a stochastic reaction-diffusion simulation over a large range of \u2329\u03c4off\u232a and TCR cluster size . The total time to escape for an individual molecule , which is the parameter directly measured in pMHC tracking experiments , is given by:\u03c4esc=\u2211i=0n\u03c4offi+\u2211i=1n\u03c4oni+\u03c4exit In this representation , \u03c4offi and \u03c4oni are the individual dwell times in the bound and unbound configurations , n is the number of rebinding events , and \u03c4exit is the duration of the final unbound period prior to ultimate escape . For the stochastic simulation , \u03c4offi and \u03c4oni are treated as random variables with exponential distributions defined by the in situ measured values of koff and kon for pMHC:TCR binding , respectively . If the pMHC diffuses out of the TCR cluster prior to rebinding , it has escaped . Otherwise , the pMHC rebinds and the cycle repeats . Using the fastest kon ( 0 . 17 \u00b5m2s\u22121molecule\u22121 ) observed in similar hybrid live cell-SLB systems ( Huppa et al . , 2010 ) and the measured diffusion coefficient of pMHC in our supported membranes , we find that \u03c4esc\u2248\u03c4off for TCR clusters of the sizes observed experimentally ( Varma et al . , 2006 ) ( \u2264100 TCR molecules ) ( Figure 6 ) . Only for unrealistically large TCR clusters ( \u223c1000 TCR molecules ) could rebinding within the same cluster lead to appreciable entrapment ( \u03c4esc>\u03c4exit ) ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 013Figure 6 .

For small TCR clusters ( 1\u2013100 TCR molecules ) \u03c4off \u2248 \u03c4esc , indicating no serial rebinding . Only for unrealistically large TCR clusters ( 1000\u201310 , 000 molecules ) does \u03c4esc become appreciably longer than \u03c4off .

Stochastic reaction-diffusion simulation of time before MCC agonist pMHC escape from TCR clusters . Simulations of \u03c4esc\u03c4off as a function of TCR cluster size , \u03c4off , and kon . The ratio \u03c4esc\u03c4off , which is an indicator of agonist pMHC entrapment , is a function of TCR cluster size and kon , but not koff . kon = 0 . 51 \u00b5m2s\u22121molecule\u22121 corresponds to the fastest average kon that allows for rebinding to the same TCR . Only for unrealistically large TCR cluster sizes ( approaching 1000 TCRs per cluster ) and fast kon is \u03c4esc\u03c4off\u226b1 , meaning that entrapment due to millisecond-scale unbinding and rebinding is unlikely to result in the minute-scale dwell times observed in our experiments . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 014 These simulations indicate that the observed values of \u03c4off are unlikely to be the result of rapid serial rebinding of one pMHC with many TCR within a TCR cluster . We note that although TCR clusters are not readily visible at the low antigen densities in these experiments , low level TCR clustering has been reported in the resting state by other methods ( Schamel and Alarcon , 2013 ) . Even with a very fast kon , if pMHC completely disengages from TCR for long enough to diffuse to an adjacent TCR , then the probability of complete escape from the TCR cluster is high . Only in the extreme limit , where kon is so fast that pMHC unbinding is predominantly followed by rebinding to the same TCR , is the escape time appreciably longer than the individual molecular dwell times . The distinction between rapidly rebinding the same TCR and a single engagement is largely semantic . However , it may reveal something about the mechanical stability of pMHC:TCR interactions , and could account for the apparently accelerated koff observed in other types of experiments . \n All evidence reported here suggests that individual agonist pMHC remain bound to the same TCR for at least several seconds for the 5c . c7 TCR and for approximately one minute for the AND TCR in live cells . Subsequent recruitment of ZAP70 indicates TCR are triggered and movement of the complexes along linear trajectories confirms stable association with the actin cytoskeleton . All of this occurs as a result of a lone agonist pMHC binding TCR , without involvement of other MHC . The measured average pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 stoichiometry indicates TCR triggering is most likely 1:1 with agonist pMHC . Supernumerary triggering of multiple TCR by a single pMHC is not observed on the timescales of minutes investigated in these experiments . The original serial triggering model ( Valitutti et al . , 1995 ) drew its conclusions from the extent of TCR down regulation measured 5 hr after exposure of T cells to antigen-pulsed APCs . Additionally , the lack of molecular-scale cooperativity in TCR triggering by agonist pMHC indicates that observed cooperativity at the level of cellular calcium response , at similar ligand densities and timescales ( Manz et al . , 2011 ) , is most likely due to intracellular feedback mechanisms ( Altan-Bonnet and Germain , 2005; Chan et al . , 2004; Das et al . , 2009; Stefanov\u00e1 et al . , 2003 ) . The timescales of the pMHC:TCR interactions we observe in live cells are consistent with SPR measurements of koff for the 5c . c7 TCR and 226 TCR , which is nearly identical to AND ( Figure 5C and Figure 7 ) ( Corse et al . , 2010; Newell et al . , 2011 ) . They are also consistent with reports of a \u223c2 s kinetic threshold for thymic selection determined in vivo ( Williams et al . , 1999; Palmer and Naeher , 2009 ) . Stochastic reaction-diffusion analysis of the measured kinetic and mobility parameters indicates that rapid serial rebinding of agonist pMHC to multiple TCRs in a signaling cluster is unlikely to be a universal mechanism for ligand discrimination and rapid signal amplification in T cells . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 015Figure 7 . Interaction of the 226 TCR with the MCC peptide . ( A ) CDR3\u03b1 ( yellow ) and CDR3\u03b2 ( orange ) loops form all the specific interactions with the peptide ( cyan ) . Hydrogen bonds between the CDR3 loops and the MCC residues are shown by dashed lines ( PDB , 3QIU ) ( B ) Comparison of CDR3 loops between the 226 and AND TCRs reveal identical sequences and suggest similar binding kinetics . 226 and AND also share V\u03b1 , J\u03b1 , V\u03b2 , and J\u03b2 gene segments that encode the residues specific for interaction with IEk ( Newell et al . , 2011 ) . The residues involved in hydrogen bonds between 226 and MCC are shown in blue . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00778 . 015 The intercellular geometry as well as active processes within the T cell have long been suspected to influence pMHC:TCR interactions ( Shaw and Dustin , 1997; Qi et al . , 2001; Burroughs and Wulfing , 2002; Zhu et al . , 2013 ) . Direct in situ measurements of individual pMHC:TCR binding kinetics , such as we report here , are extremely limited ( Huang et al . , 2010; Huppa et al . , 2010; Axmann et al . , 2012 ) but informative comparisons can be made . Notably , a recent intramolecular FRET study of the 5c . c7 TCR binding MCC pMHC reports short ( \u2329\u03c4off\u232a\u223c150 ms ) in situ 2D dwell times , nearly 35 times faster than the \u2329\u03c4off\u232a = 5 . 2 \u00b1 0 . 2 s we measured by tracking . This same study measures \u2329\u03c4off\u232a 25 times longer under conditions of cytoskeleton disruption , essentially in agreement with tracking observations . This result has been interpreted to mean that the actin cytoskeleton actively destabilizes agonist pMHC:TCR complexes . In contrast , we observe very small effects of actin disruption on agonist pMHC dwell times for AND and essentially no effect with 5c . c7 TCR ( Figure 5C ) . It is conceivable that the agonist pMHC:TCR complex does not remain bound in the same structural configuration for the duration of engagement . If mechanical coupling to actin significantly reduces the apparent \u2329\u03c4off\u232a in a single molecule FRET measurement , but not in a single molecule tracking experiment , this raises the possibility that mechanical forces can induce conformational alterations in agonist pMHC:TCR without complete disengagement of the complex . Recent structural studies of pMHC:TCR indicate the possibility of such flexibility ( Adams et al . , 2011; Hawse et al . , 2012; Reboul et al . , 2012 ) . While putative conformational changes would not affect single-molecule tracking measurements , they could produce a FRET signature ( Ha et al . , 1999; Majumdar et al . , 2007 ) . Under such a scenario , apparently fast \u2329\u03c4off\u232a observed by FRET imaging ( Huppa et al . , 2010 ) may not correspond to actual molecular unbinding and escape of agonist pMHC from TCR . In the aggregate , the data reported here indicate that spatially discrete pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 complexes form according to molecular mass action laws with relatively predictable chemical kinetics and stoichiometry in living cells . The observed pMHC:TCR molecular binding kinetics mirror solution measurements and we observe no evidence for molecular scale cooperativity in the triggering of TCR by agonist pMHC ( at low agonist density ) . Thus any amplification or other form of signal processing must occur downstream of TCR triggering . \n A plasmid containing enhanced green fluorescent protein fused to CD3 zeta-chain-associated protein of 70 kDa ( Zap70-EGFP ) was a gift of Takashi Saito , RIKEN Research Center for Allergy and Immunology , Yokohama , Japan ( Yokosuka et al . , 2005 ) . The Zap70-EGFP gene was amplified by PCR and subcloned into a murine stem cell virus parent vector ( pMSCV ) . Bi-hexahistidine-tagged major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II I-Ek protein was produced and purified as previously described ( Nye and Groves , 2008 ) . A decahistidine-tagged ICAM1-TagBFP fusion protein was generated by PCR amplifying the TagBFP sequence ( Evrogen Inc . , Moscow , Russia ) and subcloning it into a pN1-ICAM1 vector . The entire Icam1-TagBFP gene was then further subcloned into the pFastBac1 vector ( Invitrogen Inc . , Carlsbad , CA ) , which was used to generate baculovirus for infection of High Five cells ( Invitrogen Inc . ) . The ICAM1-TagBFP was subsequently purified on a Ni-NTA-agarose affinity column , eluted with an imidazole gradient , dialyzed , and stored in Tris buffer containing 10% glycerol . AND CD4+ T cells ( Kaye et al . , 1989 ) and 5 c . c7 CD4+ T cells were harvested and cultured essentially as previously described ( Smith et al . , 2011; Smoligovets et al . , 2012 ) . T cells were transduced with Zap70-EGFP and sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) according to viability and EGFP expression . The population of transduced cells that was used expressed EGFP at no more than 50% of the highest EGFP level in the overall EGFP-positive population . Using the basic sequence of moth cytochrome c ( amino acids 88\u2013103 ) and previously described variants ( Huppa et al . , 2010 ) , the following peptides were synthesized by David King at the HHMI Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at UC Berkeley and/or commercially ( Elim Biopharmaceuticals , Hayward , CA ) : MCC ( ANERADLIAYLKQATK ) , MCC ( C ) ( ANERADLIAYLKQATKGGSC ) , MCC-null ( C ) ( ANERAELIAYLTQAAKGGSC ) . For fluorophore labeling , cysteine-containing peptides were dissolved in a small amount of phosphate buffer and mixed in a 1:2 molar ratio with Atto 647N resuspended in a small amount of 1-propanol or lyophilized Atto 488 ( Atto-Tec GmbH , Siegen , Germany ) and labeled using maleimide-thiol chemistry . The peptides were then incubated at room temperature for at least 1 hr and purified on a C18 reverse phase column ( Grace\u2013Vydac , Deerfield , IL ) and H2O:acetonitrile gradient using \u00c4KTA explorer 100 FPLC system ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) . Peptide identity was confirmed after purification using mass spectrometry . TIRF experiments were performed on an inverted microscope ( Nikon Eclipse Ti; Technical Instruments , Burlingame , CA ) using a custom-built laser launch with 488 nm ( Sapphire HP; Coherent Inc . , Santa Clara , CA ) and 640 nm ( Cube; Coherent Inc . ) diode lasers , as described previously ( Smith et al . , 2011 ) . Laser powers measured at the sample were 0 . 8 mW ( 640 nm ) and 0 . 5 mW ( 488 nm ) for 500 ms exposures and 4 . 4 mW ( 640 nm ) for 17 . 5 ms exposures . A dichroic beamsplitter ( z488/647rpc; Chroma Technology Corp . , Bellows Falls , VT ) reflected the laser light through the objective lens ( Nikon 1 . 49 NA TIRF; Technical Instruments , Burlingame , CA ) and fluorescence images were recorded using an EM-CCD ( iXon 597DU; Andor Inc . , South Windsor , CT ) after passing through a laser-blocking filter ( Z488/647 M; Chroma Technology Corp . , Bellows Falls , VT ) . Bandpass filters ( FF03 525/50; Semrock Inc . , Rochester , NY and ET 700/75 , Chroma Technology Corp . , Bellows Falls , VT ) were placed in a DualView 2 Simultaneous Imaging System ( Photometrics , Tuscon , AZ ) . Colors were registered before every two-color experiment by imaging 100 nm Tetraspec beads ( Invitrogen Inc . ) deposited on a coverslip patterned with a Cr grid with \u223c80 nm width and 3\u20134 \u03bcm pitch Cr lines , since the Tetraspec beads preferentially bind the regular Cr pattern . Exposure times and time-lapse periods for most experiments were set using image collection software ( MetaMorph 7 . 5; Molecular Devices Inc . , Downingtown , PA ) , which drives an external shutter ( Uniblitz LS6; Vincent Associates , Rochester , NY ) . Exposure time and Fast Kinetics Mode for short ( 17 . 5 ms ) integration time experiments were set using Andor Solis ( Andor Inc . , South Windsor , CT ) . Exposure times were measured directly from the Fire output of the EM-CCD using an oscilloscope ( TDS 210; Tektronix , Inc . , Beaverton , OR ) . Single unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) were formed by tip sonication of a solution composed of 98 mol % 1 , 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ( DOPC ) and 2 mol % 1 , 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[ ( N- ( 5-amino-1-carboxypentyl ) iminodiacetic acid ) succinyl] ( nickel salt ) ( Ni2+-NTA-DOGS ) ( Avanti Polar Lipids , Alabaster , AL ) in Mill-Q water ( EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . Tip sonication was preferred to vesicle extrusion due to the introduction of significant levels of fluorescent impurities into the SUVs during extrusion . Prior to experiments , #2 40 mm diameter round coverslips were ultrasonicated for 30 min in 50:50 isopropyl alcohol:water , rinsed thoroughly in Milli-Q water ( EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA ) , etched for 5 min in piranha solution ( 3:1 sulfuric acid:hydrogen peroxide ) , and again rinsed thoroughly in Milli-Q water . The coverslips were used in the assembly of FCS2 Closed Chamber Systems ( flow cells; Bioptechs , Butler , PA ) , which were pre-filled with Tris-buffered saline ( TBS; 19 . 98 mM Tris , 136 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4; Mediatech Inc . , Herndon , VA ) . SUVs were then flowed into the chambers , and bilayers were allowed to form for at least 30 min . The bilayers were rinsed once with TBS , incubated for 5 min with 100 mM NiCl2 in TBS , rinsed with TBS , and then rinsed with a T cell imaging buffer composed of 1 mM CaCl2 , 2 mM MgCl2 , 20 mM HEPES , 137 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 0 . 7 mM Na2HPO4 , 6 mM d-glucose , and 1% wt/vol bovine serum albumin . 48 hr prior to experiments , MHC was loaded with peptide at 37\u00b0C in a buffer composed of 1% wt/vol bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and brought to pH 4 . 5 with citric acid . Unbound peptide was separated from peptide loaded MHC ( pMHC ) using 10k spin concentrators ( Amicon Ultra , Cork , Ireland ) and then pMHC was diluted in imaging buffer . ICAM1-TagBFP and pMHC were further diluted with imaging buffer , introduced into the flow cells , and incubated for 35 min followed by a rinse with imaging buffer . T cells resuspended in imaging buffer and added to the flow cells 35 min after the final rinse and imaged immediately for 30\u201360 min . To visualize TCR , T cells were incubated in a solution of 1 \u03bcl Alexa 647 ( Invitrogen Inc . ) -labeled H57 anti-TCR Fab and 100 \u03bcl imaging buffer for 20 min at 4\u00b0C prior to the regular imaging buffer resuspension . All other incubations during this protocol were performed at room temperature , and imaging experiments were performed at 37\u00b0C . Single molecule diffraction-limited spots were detected in raw . tif image stacks of agonist pMHC labeled with MCC-Atto488 and MCC-647N molecules by filtering for both size and intensity and linked into tracks using published particle detection and tracking algorithms ( Crocker and Grier , 1996 ) adapted for MATLAB ( The Mathworks; Natick , MA ) by Daniel Blair and Eric Dufresne ( http://physics . georgetown . edu/matlab/; accessed 16 August 2012 ) . Size and intensity thresholds were first determined by eye using a test data set and then applied uniformly to all data collected with the same exposure time and incident laser intensities . Single molecules were identified by step photobleaching detected in an automated way using a Bayesian change point detection algorithm ( Ensign and Pande , 2009 ) . The brightness of ZAP70-EGFP features varies from a single molecule to several molecules , and different brightness features are detected using slightly different methods , despite the fact that the features are physically similar . Bright ZAP70-EGFP features ( as shown in Figure 4A , D ) were detected using the same algorithm as is used for single molecule pMHC . The lower signal-to-noise single molecule ZAP70-EGFP intensity traces like those in Figure 4C were obtained by summing the intensity of the ZAP70-EGFP channel using the agonist pMHC ( labeled with Atto647N ) molecule position as a mask , as is explained in the main text . The lifetime of the bright ZAP70-EGFP speckles is difficult to accurately assess due to the fluctuating background and varying speckle intensity ( which biases measurement towards brighter , longer-lived fluorescent features ) , but speckle lifetimes appear to be longer than the single molecule ZAP70-EGFP lifetimes . Single molecule ZAP70-EGFP molecules are uncorrected for photobleaching of both ZAP70-EGFP and agonist pMHC and therefore the range of binding times reported ( 12\u2013107 s ) only serves as a lower bound for the molecular ZAP70 dwell time . The agonist pMHC step size distribution at 17 . 5 ms resolution in Figure 1D is populated using similar particle detection and tracking methods to the 500 ms resolution analysis . , Agonist pMHC:TCR binding kinetics cannot be uniquely inferred from the step size distribution , since the step size distribution is a time-independent analysis . For instance , the step size distribution measured over a certain time period with 2kon and 2koff would appear identical to a scenario with kon and koff . Lifetime distributions are roughly exponential and of the form f ( \u03c4obs ) =\u2329\u03c4obs\u232a\u22121e\u2212\u03c4obs\u2329\u03c4obs\u232a , where \u03c4obs is the observed dwell time in our experiments . The individual kinetic transitions were derived assuming the following model:pMHCfree\u21cckoffkonpMHC:TCR\u2192kblpMHCbleachedwhere pMHCfree is the fast-mobility state , pMHC:TCR is the slow-mobility state ( or the TCR stably bound state ) , pMHCbleached is the bleached slow-mobility state , koff and kon are the rates of transitions between the bound and the free pMHC , and kbl is the rate of transition from bound pMHC:TCR to photobleached pMHC . We assume that transititions between states follow a Markov memory-less process and derive a probability density function , f ( \u03c4obs ) , for the single molecule dwell time distribution: f ( \u03c4obs ) = ( \u2329\u03c4bl\u232a\u22121+\u2329\u03c4off\u232a\u22121 ) e\u2212\u03c4obs ( \u2329\u03c4bl\u232a\u22121+\u2329\u03c4off\u232a\u22121 ) , where ( \u2329\u03c4bl\u232a\u22121+\u2329\u03c4off\u232a\u22121 ) \u22121=\u2329\u03c4obs\u232a is the observed mean dwell time in our experiments . Agonist pMHC labeled with Atto488 and Atto647N SLB bleaching curves were background subtracted and then fit to an exponential decay function of the form f ( t ) =kble\u2212kblt . Fitting was done using MATLAB . Simulations were performed using MATLAB . Our simulation models a TCR cluster as a square lattice upon which agonist pMHC molecules bind discrete TCR lattice sites for duration \u03c4offi , \u03c4offi where is treated as a random variable drawn from an exponential distribution with mean equal to \u2329\u03c4off\u232a . \u2329\u03c4off\u232a is varied over several orders of magnitude and is chosen to match measured values from the literature . pMHC are initially placed at a randomly lattice position drawn from a uniform distribution . After each time period ( determined by \u03c4offi ) , the agonist pMHC molecule steps to a new lattice site or stays at the same lattice site ( the lattice spacing is set to 10 nm to roughly follow the size of the TCR complex [Newell et al . , 2011; Yin et al . , 2012] ) until the agonist pMHC is no longer on the TCR cluster , such that \u03c4esck=\u2211i=0n\u03c4offi+\u2211i=1n\u03c4oni+\u03c4exit , where n indicates the number of steps an individual agonist pMHC molecule takes before exiting the TCR cluster , \u03c4on is the time period between unbinding and binding events , and \u03c4exit is the time between the last unbinding event and the ultimate exit from the TCR cluster . Step size is treated as a combination of two independent random variables , ( \u0394x , \u0394y , ) drawn from Gaussian distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 2DSLB\u03c4on . The step size is then a random variable \u0394r=\u0394x2+\u0394y2 and the angle of displacement is drawn from a uniform distribution . The interval between binding events , \u03c4on , is treated as a random variable drawn from an exponential distribution with mean kon \u03c1TCR where the density of TCR , \u03c1TCR , is taken to be 10 , 000 molecules/\u00b5m2 ( as in the central supramolecular activation cluster ) . In this way \u2329\u03c4off\u232a=1k\u2211k\u03c4esck , where k is the number of iterations ( 100 in the case of Figure 6 and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , is calculated for every combination of \u2329\u03c4off\u232a , TCR cluster size , and kon . Note that since \u03c4off\u226b\u03c4on , \u03c4esc\u03c4off\u2248\u2329n\u232a , where \u2329n\u232a is equivalent to the TCR cluster size . This relationship between \u03c4esc\u03c4off and TCR cluster size can be seen in Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 . It is possible that agonist pMHC binding interactions with CD4 could slow the mobility of an individual agonist pMHC within a TCR cluster relative to DSLB when the agonist pMHC are unbound from TCR . This could hypothetically lead to entrapment and long single molecule tracks ( like those reported here ) in the absence of direct , sustained agonist pMHC-TCR interactions . While such a mechanism is conceivable , there is no direct evidence for such a tethering mechanism in the literature ."}

Cyanobacteria in the oceans are among the world\u2019s most important oxygen producers and carbon dioxide consumers . Synechocystis is a spherical single-celled cyanobacterium that measures about three thousandths of a millimetre across . Because Synechocystis needs sunlight to produce energy , it is important for it to find places where the light is neither too weak nor too strong . Unlike some bacteria , Synechocystis can\u2019t swim , but it can crawl across surfaces . It uses this ability to move to places where the light conditions are better . It was already known that Synechocystis cells move towards a light source that is shone at them from one side , which implies that the cyanobacteria can \u201csee\u201d where the light is . But how can such a tiny cell accurately detect where light is coming from ? Schuergers et al . tracked how Synechocystis moved in response to different light conditions , and found that the secret of \u201cvision\u201d in these cyanobacteria is that the cells act as tiny spherical lenses . When a light is shone at the cell , an image of the light source is focused at the opposite edge of the cell . Light-detecting molecules called photoreceptors respond to the focused image of the light source , and this provides the information needed to steer the cell towards the light . Although the details are different , and although a Synechocystis cell is in terms of volume about 500 billion times smaller than a human eyeball , vision in Synechocystis actually works by principles similar to vision in humans . Schuergers et al . \u2019s findings open plenty of further questions , as other types of bacteria may also act as tiny lenses . More also remains to be learnt about how the cyanobacteria process visual information . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12620 . 002", "source": "Bacterial phototaxis was first recognized over a century ago , but the method by which such small cells can sense the direction of illumination has remained puzzling . The unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp . PCC 6803 moves with Type IV pili and measures light intensity and color with a range of photoreceptors . Here , we show that individual Synechocystis cells do not respond to a spatiotemporal gradient in light intensity , but rather they directly and accurately sense the position of a light source . We show that directional light sensing is possible because Synechocystis cells act as spherical microlenses , allowing the cell to see a light source and move towards it . A high-resolution image of the light source is focused on the edge of the cell opposite to the source , triggering movement away from the focused spot . Spherical cyanobacteria are probably the world\u2019s smallest and oldest example of a camera eye . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12620 . 001 \n Many prokaryotes move directionally in response to a chemical or physical stimulus . However , it is generally assumed that bacteria are too small for direct sensing of a concentration gradient across the cell: instead they probe changes in stimulus concentration over time , as in the classic paradigm of flagella-mediated chemotaxis in Escherichia coli ( reviewed by Wadhams and Armitage , 2004 ) . When moving through a spatial concentration gradient of an attractant , E . coli cells experience temporal concentration changes , which they sense by employing a biochemical memory that directs a \u201cbiased random walk\u201d . Swimming along a straight path ( run ) alternates with random changes of direction ( tumble ) . Tumbles become less frequent when cells sense a temporal increase in attractant concentration , introducing a bias to movement up a concentration gradient ( Berg and Brown , 1972 ) . For phototrophic prokaryotes , light is the main source of energy but also potentially harmful , depending on intensity and wavelength . Unsurprisingly , many phototrophs can alter their movement in response to the light environment ( reviewed in H\u00e4der , 1987 ) . Bacterial phototaxis was first noted in 1883 ( Engelmann , 1883 ) and has been characterized in free-swimming phototrophs including purple bacteria and Halobacterium spp . ( Hildebrand and Dencher , 1975; Alam and Oesterhelt , 1984 ) . Cyanobacteria , which are oxygenic phototrophs , do not swim with flagella . Instead , various species exhibit \u201ctwitching\u201d or \u201cgliding\u201d motility over moist surfaces ( Pringsheim , 1968 ) . This movement can be directed towards a light source , thus constituting true phototaxis ( Choi et al . , 1999; Bhaya , 2004; Yoshihara and Ikeuchi , 2004 ) . The model unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp . PCC 6803 ( hereafter Synechocystis ) has spherical cells about 3 \u00b5m in diameter and moves using Type IV pili ( T4P ) ( Bhaya et al . , 2000; Yoshihara et al . , 2001 ) . The location of the T4P extension motor PilB1 implies that pili are extended at the leading edge of the cell , and therefore that movement is generated by pilus retraction ( Schuergers et al . , 2015; Wilde and Mullineaux , 2015 ) , as has been shown in other bacteria ( Merz et al . , 2000 ) . It has recently been established that the motility of a filamentous cyanobacterium is also T4P-dependent , suggesting that this form of motility is widespread in cyanobacteria ( Khayatan et al . , 2015 ) . One likely exception is marine Synechococcus spp . , which swims and exhibits chemotaxis without obvious surface appendages ( Willey and Waterbury , 1989; Ehlers and Oster , 2012 ) apart from short spicules found in one of the motile Synechococcus strains ( Samuel et al . , 2001 ) . Synechocystis T4P-dependent phototaxis can be observed microscopically at the single\u00a0cell level and macroscopically through the migration of cell colonies . Genetic studies have identified a number of photoreceptors that influence phototactic behavior under different light regimes ( Bhaya , 2004 ) . While Synechocystis harbors signal transduction systems for pilus biogenesis that are homologous to the chemotaxis system in E . coli , it lacks the CheR methyltransferase and the CheB methylesterase that are required in most chemotactic bacteria to sense temporal changes in attractant concentration ( Wuichet and Zhulin , 2010 ) . This suggests a different mode of directional control . Previous studies of Synechocystis single\u00a0cell phototaxis ( Choi et al . , 1999; Chau et al . , 2015 ) have not addressed the question of how an individual cell might be able to perceive the direction of illumination . Here , we establish that individual Synechocystis cells can directly and accurately perceive the position of a unidirectional light source , and control their motility so as to move towards it . We then show that Synechocystis cells act as microlenses , and that the light intensity gradient across the cell due to this lensing effect is far greater than the effects of shading due to light absorption or reflection . Finally , we use highly-localized laser excitation to show that specific excitation of one side of the cell triggers movement away from the light , indicating that positive phototaxis results from movement away from an image of the light source focused on the opposite side of the cell . Essentially , the cell acts as a microscopic eyeball . \n Individual Synechocystis cells moving in two dimensions on an\u00a0agarose surface in response to different light regimes were tracked microscopically to determine whether single cells are capable of direct perception of the position of a light source . First , we tested the response of cells to a light intensity gradient projected onto the surface from the microscope condenser ( Figure 1a ) , using a gradient of white light from 0\u201320 \u00b5mol photons m\u20132 s\u20131 , an intensity range that is relevant for positive phototaxis ( Choi et al . , 1999; Bhaya , 2004; Chau et al . , 2015 ) . However , the cells moved randomly without any significant directional bias ( Figure 1b; Video 1 ) . If Synechocystis phototaxis were based on a biochemical memory like E . coli chemotaxis , cells would perceive temporal changes in light intensity as they move across the surface through the light gradient and would then accumulate in regions of optimal light intensity . This did not occur ( Figure 1b , Video 1 ) . By contrast , when cells were illuminated by a unidirectional light source ( RGB illumination at 10 \u00b5mol photons m\u20132 s\u20131 ) at an angle oblique to the surface ( Figure 1a ) , the majority of motile cells switched direction within about 1 min , and then moved directly towards the light source ( Figure 1c , d , f; Video 1 ) . Under illumination from two equal-intensity orthogonal light sources , the majority of cells moved towards a point midway between the two light sources ( Figure 1e; Video 1 ) . These behaviors are not consistent with a run-and-tumble mechanism or any kind of biased random walk . In accord with previous studies ( Choi et al . , 1999; Chau et al . , 2015 ) , we conclude that individual cells can directly and accurately perceive the position of a light source and control their motility accordingly . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12620 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12620 . 004 Synechocystis cells contain a dense lamellar system of thylakoid membranes packed with photosynthetic complexes , and we initially postulated that light direction sensing depends on shading by the thylakoids , with the motility apparatus activated by brighter light at the illuminated side of the cell and deactivated at the shaded side of the cell . To assess the plausibility of this idea , we estimated the transmission spectrum of a single motile cell , scaling the absorption spectrum for a cell suspension according to the mean cellular pigment content . To ensure that pigment content was appropriate for phototactic cells , we used cells taken from moving colonies on motility plates ( Figure 2 ) . The transmission spectrum shows that even at peak absorption wavelengths , a single cell can absorb only about 20% of the photons that pass through it ( Figure 2 ) . Although local pigment concentrations within the cell are quite high ( Figure 2 ) , the very short optical path\u00a0length means that light\u00a0absorption by the cell is low . Note that our estimate assumes a homogeneous distribution of pigments within the thylakoid region of the cell: in reality , pigment clustering will tend to decrease the cell absorbance due to enhanced self-shading of pigments ( Duysens , 1956 ) . Thus , 20% represents a maximum estimate of the proportion of photons that can be absorbed , and the light intensity gradient across the cell due to shading must be almost negligible . The direct measurement of single\u00a0cell absorption spectra is technically challenging , and we are aware of only one such measurement in the literature for a cyanobacterium . Sugiura and Itoh ( 2012 ) show that the peak absorbance for a single cell of Nostoc sp . is about 0 . 04 . This corresponds to a peak absorption of about 10% of the photons that pass through the cell , which is even lower than our estimate for Synechocystis . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12620 . 005Figure 2 . Estimated transmission spectrum of a single motile Synechocystis cell . Estimate obtained by scaling and converting the absorption spectrum for a suspension of cells from a moving Synechocystis colony , as detailed in Materials and methods . Pigments ( including chlorophyll: Chl and phycocyanin-coupled phycocyanobilin: PCB ) are assumed to be evenly distributed within the thylakoid region as shown in the diagram , and the estimated transmission is for a narrow beam of light passing straight through the center of the cell , with an optical path\u00a0length through the thylakoid region of 1 \u03bcm . The spectrum represents a minimum estimate for transmission through the cell , since the estimate assumes a homogeneous distribution of pigments within the thylakoid region . In reality , inhomogeneous distribution of membranes and pigments will tend to decrease absorption due to enhanced self-shading ( Duysens , 1956 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12620 . 005 Most light microscopy uses illumination orthogonal to the surface on which the sample rests , with the exception of dark-field microscopy , which uses oblique illumination from all sides . While investigating Synechocystis phototaxis , we observed cells instead with oblique illumination from one side only . Observations with this unusual illumination suggest a solution to the problem of directional light perception in Synechocystis . These images reveal that each cell acts as a microscopic spherical lens , focusing an intense light spot close to the opposite side of the cell from the light source and the direction of movement ( Figure 3a ) . Images from two orthogonal light sources ( as employed in one of the motility assays in Figure 1e and Video 1 ) are focused at different points on the cell periphery ( Figure 3a ) , indicating that the cell can focus an image of its surroundings at the plasma membrane . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12620 . 006Figure 3 .

Optical set-up for oblique-angle excitation fluorescence microscopy to visualize periplasmic GFP fluorescence ( Figure 3c ) . Fluorescence excitation was achieved by near-total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) ( \u201chighly inclined\u201d/\u201coblique\u201d ) illumination of the samples , with fiber-coupled 488 nm laser light injected into the epifluorescence port of the microscope via the dichroic mirror . The fiber , collimator , quarter-wave plate and total internal reflection ( TIR ) -lens were mounted on a translation stage and positioned such that the focused beam was centered at the BFP of the Olympus 100x objective lens . By adjusting the translation stage , the position of the beam could be translated across the BFP to adjust the inclination angle of the beam through the sample .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12620 . 007 The images in Figure 3a do not give a quantitative picture of the lensing effect since the focused light spot is observed very indirectly via light reflected from the agar surface . Therefore , to quantify the lensing effect , we first employed a Synechocystis mutant that accumulates green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) evenly distributed in the periplasm ( Spence et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , GFP can be used as local reporter of light intensity at the cell periphery ( Figure 3b ) since GFP fluorescence will be proportional to the local excitation light intensity . GFP fluorescence images with oblique laser excitation show a spot of light sharply focused at the opposite edge of the cell . Profiles of GFP fluorescence around the cell perimeter ( Figure 3c ) indicate that the mean ratio of the light intensity at the center of this focused spot to the intensity at the front of the cell facing the light source was 4 . 1 \u00b1 1 . 5 ( mean and standard\u00a0deviation , n = 13 cells from one representative experiment ) and the observed mean full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) of the focused spot was 609 \u00b1 30 nm ( mean and standard\u00a0deviation , n = 11 cells ) . Since the measured FWHM for the point-spread function of the microscope was 270 nm , the true FWHM for the focused spot of 488 nm light at the cell periphery can be estimated to be about 550 nm . This experiment shows that for 488 nm light , lensing effects leading to concentration of light at the opposite side of the cell from the light source are overwhelmingly greater than shading effects , which would lead to higher light intensity on the illuminated side of the cell . Shading effects at other wavelengths in the range from 400\u00a0to\u00a0750 nm could be only marginally greater than at 488 nm ( Figure 2 ) . The spatial resolution of the fluorescence measurement in Figure 3b is limited by the optical point-spread function of the microscope . Therefore , for higher-resolution measurement of near-field light perturbation by Synechocystis cells , we used a photolithographic method that gives a very high resolution image of the light pattern adjacent to the cell , although it does not provide such a direct and quantitative measurement of relative light intensity as the fluorescence imaging in Figure 3b . Synechocystis cells were adsorbed onto the surface of a photopolymer and collimated UV light ( 365 nm ) was projected vertically down onto them ( Figure 3d ) . The UV light induces cross-linking of the photopolymer . After development , the surface relief of the photopolymer gives a high-resolution replica of the light\u00a0field around and beneath each cell , which we examined by atomic\u00a0force microscopy ( Figure 3E ) . Synechocystis cells produced distinctive near-field optical scattering patterns on the polymer surface with a remarkably sharp and intense peak beneath the center of each cell . We measured an FWHM of 281 \u00b1 33 nm ( mean and standard\u00a0deviation , n = 6 from profiles at different angles across the representative image shown ) ( Figure 3e ) . This experiment indicates that near-UV light is focused to a spot with diameter less than the wavelength . Figure 3e also confirms that near-UV light is concentrated at the side of the cell opposite to the light source in a similar manner to light in the visible range . As with visible light ( Figure 2b , c ) , the lensing effect predominates over any shading effects with near-UV light ( Figure 3e ) . To probe the physical basis for the lensing effect , we modeled light perturbation by the cell with finite difference time domain ( FDTD ) simulations , a method that uses the electromagnetic Maxwell equations without any geometrical simplifications ( Yee , 1966 ) . This electromagnetic description traces all observed effects back to the interference of incoming waves with waves scattered by their encounter with the object , which in this case was a simplified model of the cell as a microsphere with uniform refractive index . The method predicts a combination of effects that , on larger scales , are described as interference , refraction and internal reflection . We found that the observed near-field light pattern ( Figure 3e ) could be accurately reproduced by an FDTD simulation approximating the cell as a dielectric sphere with a diameter of 3 \u00b5m and a refractive index of 1 . 4 ( Figure 3f ) . Microspheres with similar dimensions to Synechocystis have been experimentally shown to produce similar sharply\u00a0focused light beams at the edge of the object opposite to the light source: these are termed \u201cphotonic nanojets\u201d ( Ferrand et al . , 2008; Heifetz et al . , 2009 ) . The micro-optic effects shown in Figure 3 produce intensity differences across Synechocystis cells that are opposite in orientation and at least 20 times greater than those predicted from shading due to light absorption by the photosynthetic pigments ( compare Figure 3c with Figure 2 ) . Figure 3a , b , c , e provide direct experimental confirmation that light intensity is highest at the edge of the cell furthest from the light source . This suggests that the basis for directional light perception by Synechocystis should depend on the lensing properties of the cells , with positive phototaxis based on the cell moving away from the light spot focused at its periphery . We tested this idea by using a highly\u00a0focused laser light spot ( Lowe et al . , 2015 ) as an alternative way to selectively illuminate one edge of the cell . Synechocystis cells moving directionally on an agarose surface towards a red ( 625 nm ) light emitting diode ( LED ) light source were visualized by fluorescence from the photosynthetic pigments excited by the LED light . Focused spots of light at the rear periphery of the cell were again observed under this illumination regime ( Figure 4a , Video 2 ) , showing that the focused light spots extend into the thylakoid membrane region . The moving cells were allowed to encounter a spot of 640 nm laser light focused on the agarose surface ( Figure 4; Video 2 ) . The intensity gradient at the edge of the laser spot was steep enough to ensure specific exposure of one side of the cell to the light ( Figure 4a ) . Whenever one edge of a cell encountered the edge of the laser spot , the cell changed direction to move away from the laser illumination ( Figure 4b; Video 2 ) . Cells did not cross the center of the intense laser spot , but instead changed direction when the laser light intensity at the front edge of the cell exceeded the intensity of the light spot focused by the cell at its rear periphery by a factor of about 2\u201310 , as assessed from the brightness of fluorescence from the photosynthetic pigments ( Figure 4c ) . In accord with our hypothesis , this shows that Synechocystis phototaxis is essentially a photophobic response to selective excitation of one side of the cell . The data in Figure 4 and Video 2 indicate that this photophobic response is increasingly strong with stronger localized excitation: thus , when the cells encounter laser light that is stronger than the focused light spot at the rear edge of the cell , they change direction to move away from the laser light . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12620 . 008Video 2 .

Optical set-up used to measure the response of Synechocystis cells to a highly\u00a0focused laser light spot ( Figure 4; Video 2 ) . ( a ) The time\u00a0lapse microscope was constructed on the base of an Olympus IX81 microscope , using a 40x\u00d7 objective lens ( Air , NA 0 . 75 ) . Two air-cooled electron-multiplying charge-coupled device ( EMCCD ) cameras were coupled to the camera port of the microscope via a magnifying relay . The cameras were simultaneously triggered using a TTL ( transistor-transistor\u00a0logic ) pulse from an external digital-to-analog converter , with an exposure time of 50 ms and a frequency of 0 . 25 Hz . A dichroic mirror in the Fourier plane of the camera relay split the emission into red ( fluorescence ) and green ( transmission bright-field imaging ) channels . Each channel had a separate band\u00a0pass filter . The focused laser spot was generated by expanding a collimated beam from a fiber-coupled continuous wave ( CW ) diode laser , injected via the epifluorescence port of the microscope and directed to the objective lens via a dichroic filter . The beam was expanded to overfill the back aperture of the objective lens to achieve a diffraction-limited spot at the focal plane . A combination of neutral density\u00a0filters and a half-wave plate and polarizing beam splitter were used to adjust the power of the laser to approximately 0 . 01 \u03bcW . A 1:1 lens pair with one lens mounted on a Z-translation stage was used to adjust the axial position of the focus at the sample plane . A quarter-wave plate was used to circularly polarize the beam before it was injected into the microscope . The laser intensity profile is shown in ( b ) . Bright-field trans-illumination was performed by fiber-coupling a 530 nm LED into a multimode fiber and imaging the magnified end of the fiber at the sample plane using a condenser lens . The LED was TTL triggered from via the camera acquisition to reduce light exposure to the cells , resulting in a synchronized 50 ms pulse during acquisition . A third LED ( 625 nm , 3 mW ) was mounted close to the sample at an oblique angle to provide directional illumination for the motility assay . LED , light emitting diode . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12620 . 010 \n Here we have shown that Synechocystis cells act as very effective spherical microlenses that focus a sharp image of a light source at the opposite edge of the cell . This implies that positive phototaxis ( i . e . movement towards a light source ) is actually triggered as a negative response to the focused spot of light at rear periphery of the cell . We directly tested this idea by exposing cells to a spot of red laser light that was sharply\u00a0focused enough to selectively excite one edge of the cell ( Figure 4 , Video 2 ) . As predicted by our hypothesis , cells moved away from localized laser excitation that was only slightly brighter than the focused image of the light source ( Figure 4 , Video 2 ) . This result is the opposite of what would be expected from a \u201cshading\u201d model for directional light perception , which would predict that light in this intensity range should attract the cells . Synechocystis motility depends on the extension , adhesion and retraction of T4P ( Bhaya , 2004 ) , which is powered by the motor ATPases PilB and PilT ( Merz et al . , 2000 ) . We previously examined the localization of one of these motor ATPases in Synechocystis with GFP-tagging ( Schuergers et al . , 2015 ) . We were unable to generate a strain with functional GFP-tagged PilT , but a strain expressing PilB1-GFP in a \u2206pilB1 null background was motile and capable of phototaxis , albeit with lower efficiency than the wild type ( Schuergers et al . , 2015 ) . Imaging of PilB1-GFP in Synechocystis shows that it is localized in a crescent-like zone of the plasma membrane at one side of the cell , and that these patches can dynamically relocate to other areas of the membrane ( Schuergers et al . , 2015 ) . For cells without directional illumination , random relocation of the PilB1-GFP patch frequently occurs within a 5 min window . The direction of motility in Synechocystis strongly correlates with the position of the PilB1 patch , indicating that direction is determined by the localization of PilB1 , probably in concert with other T4P components such as PilT ( Schuergers et al . , 2015 ) . In Myxococcus xanthus , both PilB and PilT show dynamic relocalization between the two cell poles , on comparable timescales ( Bulyha et al . , 2009 ) . It is clear that multiple photoreceptors are involved in Synechocystis phototaxis , with light sensors that absorb at different wavelengths and trigger either positive or negative phototaxis ( Ng et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , motility is modulated by the second messengers cyclic diguanylate monophosphate ( c-di-GMP ) ( Savakis et al . , 2012 ) and cyclic adenosine\u00a0monophosphate ( cAMP ) ( Terauchi and Ohmori , 1999; Bhaya et al . , 2006 ) . However , the best-characterized candidate for a directional photoreceptor for positive phototaxis is PixJ1 ( also known as TaxD1 ) . Mutants in which the pixJ1 gene is inactivated show only negative phototaxis ( Yoshihara et al . , 2000; Bhaya et al . , 2001 ) . PixJ1 is a cyanobacteriochrome with two transmembrane domains , a chromophore-binding domain and a domain with similarity to the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins of enterobacteria at the C-terminus ( Bhaya et al . , 2001; Yoshihara and Ikeuchi , 2004 ) . Proteomic studies with cell fractionation indicate that PixJ1 is located in the plasma membrane ( Pisareva et al . , 2007 ) and this is an important consideration for our model . Downstream signal transduction from PixJ1 likely involves the products of neighboring genes in the tax1 locus , since mutants lacking these genes ( apart from pixI ) also show only negative phototaxis ( Bhaya et al . , 2001; Yoshihara et al . , 2000 ) . The respective gene products include homologs of the E . coli chemotaxis signal transducers CheW , CheA and CheY ( Bhaya et al . , 2001; Yoshihara and Ikeuchi , 2004 ) . A likely signal transduction pathway would proceed through light activation of PixJ1 ( sll0041 ) that regulates autophosphorylation of the CheA homolog sll0043 ( PixL ) via the CheW homolog sll0040 ( PixI ) . PixL could transfer the phosphate group to the CheY-like response regulators sll0038 ( PixG ) and/or sll0039 ( PixH ) . By analogy with the E . coli chemotaxis system ( reviewed by Sourjik and Wingreen , 2012 ) , these response regulators might interact directly with the Synechocystis motility apparatus . Combining our current results with the previous study on PilB1 localization and motility in Synechocystis ( Schuergers et al . , 2015 ) and the likely scheme for signal transduction discussed above leads to a simple model for control of positive phototaxis in Synechocystis , which is illustrated in Figure 5 . The bright focused image of the light source is perceived by PixJ1 in the plasma membrane , resulting in local changes in the phosphorylation status of the response regulators PixG and/or PixH , which leads to local inactivation of the T4P motility apparatus and dispersal of the motor proteins ( PilB1 and likely also PilT ) . The motility apparatus therefore assembles at the side of the cell facing the light , resulting in movement towards the source ( Figure 5 ) . The 1 min timescale for direction switching in Synechocystis ( Figure 1f ) is consistent with the rapid kinetics of relocalization of PilB1 patches ( Schuergers et al . , 2015 ) . Responses to multiple light sources ( as in Figure 1e and Figure 4 ) can be explained if it is assumed that the dispersal signal is graded with light intensity . Thus when a cell is exposed to a stronger light source at one edge ( as with cells encountering the focused laser spot in Figure 4 and Video 2 ) , the motility apparatus is always most strongly inactivated in the region of strongest local illumination . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12620 . 011Figure 5 . Model for control of positive phototaxis in Synechocystis . Directional illumination of the cell produces a sharply\u00a0focused and intense spot of light ( resembling a photonic nanojet ) at the cell periphery on the opposite side from the light source . The focused spot is perceived by photoreceptors in the cytoplasmic membrane ( for example PixJ1 ) triggering signal transduction via CheY-like response regulators that locally inactivates the T4P motility apparatus , dispersing T4P components including the extension motor PilB1 . Consequently , patches of the motor proteins can only form on the side of the cell facing the light source . Pili are extended and retracted at this side of the cell , which therefore moves towards the light . T4P , Type IV pili . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12620 . 011 The model in Figure 5 implies that , essentially the Synechocystis cell functions as a microscopic eyeball , with the spherical cell body as the lens and the cytoplasmic membrane as the retina . From the observed dimensions of the spot of 488 nm light focused by Synechocystis cells ( Figure 3c ) we can estimate that Synechocystis \u201cvision\u201d has an angular resolution ( FWHM ) of about 21\u00b0 , essentially limited by light wavelength and the area of the plasma membrane , which is tiny in comparison to an animal retina . However , this resolution is sufficient to incorporate quite complex spatial information into a 360\u00b0 image of the cell\u2019s surroundings , and our data in Figure 1e indicate that the cell can integrate information from distinct and spatially separated light sources . The directional motile responses of the cells ( Figure 1c , d ) show a distribution of displacement angles with FWHM ~30\u00b0 . This is less accurate than the initial imaging of the light source , which suggests an unsurprising degree of spreading and noise during the signal transduction that comes between initial light perception and the response of the motility apparatus . Our model ( Figure 5 ) implies that the maximum efficiency of directional light\u00a0sensing will be achieved in a spherical cell . Among the unicellular cyanobacteria , a number of species of the genera Synechocystis and Gloeocapsa are described as motile and phototactic , and these species do indeed have spherical or near-spherical cells ( Rippka et al . , 1979 ) . However , the rod-shaped unicellular thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus is also motile and appears capable of direct perception of light direction ( Kondou et al . , 2001 ) . The Thermosynechococcus homolog of Synechocystis PixJ1 ( TePixJ ) is clustered at the cell poles ( Kondou et al . , 2002 ) . For our model to be applied to Thermosynechococcus , the cell would need a method to concentrate light at the pole furthest away from the light source . Micro-optic effects in rod-shaped cells such as those of Thermosynechococcus need further investigation . Cyanobacteria are not the only unicellular organisms capable of directional light perception . Rhodospirillum centenum cells form phototactic swarm colonies , with an unknown mechanism of light direction sensing ( Ragatz et al . , 1995 ) . Phototaxis in the larger cells of some unicellular eukaryotic green algae is mediated by clusters of photoreceptors known as eyespots , coupled with complex shading and reflecting devices ( Kreimer , 2009 ) . Lensing effects are implicated in phototactic orientation and phototropic responses in some other eukaryotes ( Shropshire , 1962; H\u00e4der and Burkart , 1983 ) . However , focused imaging at the cell periphery in the tiny spherical cells of Synechocystis represents a particularly elegant and compact solution to the problem of directional light-perception , that is probably more ancient than the eukaryotic systems . Spherical cyanobacteria may have been the first organisms to see their world . The micro-optic effects that we observe in cyanobacterial cells are relevant not only to phototaxis but also to photosynthesis , since light distribution within the cell is so strongly affected . Future work will also need to explore the biological implications of optical lensing in non-photosynthetic bacteria , since such micro-optic effects are likely to be widespread in bacteria with cells of the appropriate size and shape . \n We used a motile sub-strain of the original Synechocystis sp . PCC 6803 wild type from the Pasteur Culture Collection , acquired from the lab of S . Shestakov ( Moscow ) in 1993 . This sub-strain ( PCC-M ) was recently characterized by complete genome sequencing ( Trautmann et al . , 2012 ) . Synechocystis cells were grown for at least 24 h on motility medium ( 0 . 3% ( w/v ) agarose in BG11 medium ( Stanier et al . , 1971 ) supplemented with 0 . 2% glucose and 10 mM Tris ( hydroxymethyl ) methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic\u00a0acid ( TES ) ( pH 8 . 0 ) buffer ) in dark boxes with a one sided opening leading to a directional illumination of 5\u201310 \u00b5mol photons m\u20132 s\u20131 ( Phillips MASTER TL-D Super 80 18W/840 , Philips GmbH Market DACH , Germany ) . Cells from the moving front of a colony on a motility plate were resuspended in fresh BG11 medium and 3 \u00b5l aliquots were directly spotted on top of 5 ml motility medium in 35 mm glass-bottom plates . When liquid droplets were no longer visible ( 5\u201310 min ) a cover-slip was carefully placed on top of the cells and the surrounding surfaces of the plates were covered with a silicone ring to minimize surface oscillations and evaporation . Time-lapse videos were captured at room temperature ( ca . 22\u00b0C ) using an upright Nikon Eclipse Ni-U microscope ( Nikon Instruments , Germany ) fitted with a 40\u00d7 objective ( numerical aperture 0 . 75 ) . Gradient illumination was with white light from the microscope condenser lamp . RGB\u00a0LEDs ( 470/525/625 nm at equal intensity ) ( World Trading Net GmbH , Germany ) for directional illumination were mounted in boreholes of a black plastic cylinder surrounding the motility plates . Light intensities were measured with a LiCOR light-meter with a planar quantum sensor ( LI-COR Biosciences GmbH , Germany ) with a detection window from 400\u2013700 nm . Single cell movement was captured at 1 frame per 3 s . Unless otherwise stated , the exposure time was 200 ms to reduce the background light needed for visualizing the cells . We developed the BacteriaMobilityQuant software ( https://web . fe . up . pt/~dee11017/software/BacterialMobilityQuant . zip ) implemented in MATLAB\u00a0for tracking single cells in time\u00a0lapse videos . It is based on a detection-association tracking approach that relies on the Laplacian of Gaussian filter ( LoG ) for the task of bacteria detection ( Esteves et al . , 2013a;\u00a0Esteves et al . , 2013b ) . The LoG filter is based on the image scale-space representation to enhance the blob-like structure as introduced by Lindeberg ( Lindeberg , 1994 ) . The scale of the LoG filter is set to the expected range of the bacterial radius . The bacteria detection is performed by finding local maxima of LoG response in the input image ( number of patches for local maxima detection controlled manually by a parameter ) . The detected maxima enable the estimation of bacteria location . We performed bacteria tracking based on the spatial distance between detections in consecutive frames ( Esteves et al . , 2013b ) . Data analysis of the raw tracks was done using R software ( R\u00a0CoreTeam , 2013 ) implementing the CIRCULAR package ( Agostinelli and Lund , 2013 ) . To eliminate artifacts due to wrong mapping of dividing cells or cells in densely populated areas , only cells that could be tracked for at least 25 consecutive frames with an average velocity below 0 . 4 \u00b5m s\u20131 and a maximum displacement of less than 8 \u00b5m between two frames ( 3 s ) were considered . Cells with an average velocity lower than 0 . 05 \u00b5m s\u20131 were regarded as immotile and discarded . Displacement and orientation were calculated for all cells that could be continuously tracked for 60 frames , during 5 min after the onset of the directional light . All the data shown in Figure 1 are from a single continuous experiment to ensure the reliability of quantitative comparisons . The experiment is representative of >10 such experiments carried out under comparable conditions . Synechocystis cells were scraped from a moving colony on a motility plate and resuspended in fresh BG11 medium . An absorption spectrum for the culture was recorded in an Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer ( Olis Inc , Bogart , GA ) , which is equipped with a wide detection window to minimize distortion due to light scattering . After subtraction of the optical density due to light scattering at 750 nm , the absorption spectrum was deconvoluted into chlorophyll and phycobilin components and chlorophyll and phycocyanobilin concentrations were estimated according to the formulae of Myers et al . ( 1980 ) . Cell density in the suspension was estimated by counting in a hemocytometer , leading to estimates of 2 . 94 \u00d7 107 chlorophyll molecules and 3 . 70 \u00d7 107 phycocyanin-coupled phycocyanobilin molecules per cell . These numbers are slightly higher than previously estimated ( Mann et al . , 2000 ) ; however , this study used different growth conditions . Effective pigment concentrations in the thylakoid membranes were then estimated by approximating the multiple thylakoid lamellae around the periphery of the cytoplasm as a hollow sphere with inner diameter 1 \u00b5m and outer diameter 2 \u00b5m , corresponding to the dimensions estimated from fluorescence micrographs . Pigments were assumed to be evenly distributed within the hollow sphere . A narrow light\u00a0beam passing straight through the center of the cell would then have a total path-length of 1 \u00b5m through an effective chlorophyll concentration of 6 . 7 mM and an effective phycocyanobilin concentration of 8 . 4 mM . This would give a peak single\u00a0cell absorbance of 0 . 106 at 620 nm from the published extinction coefficients ( Myers et al . , 1980 ) . To estimate the full single\u00a0cell absorption spectrum , the absorption spectrum for the culture was scaled appropriately . The scaled spectrum was converted into the transmission spectrum shown in Figure 2 . Note that the calculation considers only light passing straight through the center of the cell and ignores any effects due to refraction and interference . In reality , the photosynthetic pigments will not be evenly distributed in the thylakoid region as we had to assume for the calculation , but rather clustered into membrane layers , reaction centers and light-harvesting complexes . Furthermore , the membranes themselves are usually not as regular and symmetrical as assumed in our model . A homogeneous distribution of pigments will maximize the absorption , since inhomogeneous clustering is liable to decrease absorption due to enhanced mutual shading of pigments ( Duysens , 1956 ) . Therefore , the spectrum shown represents a minimum estimate of light transmission through a single cell . The Synechocystis torA-gfp mutant , expressing GFP fused to the TorA leader sequence for export to the periplasm , was previously described ( Spence et al . , 2003 ) . Cells were grown in liquid culture to OD750nm ~1 . 0 in BG11 medium supplemented with 50 \u00b5g ml\u20131 spectinomycin . 100 \u00b5l of culture was added to a chamber in an ibiTreat-coated 8-well \u00b5-slide from ibidi and cells were\u00a0left for 10 min to settle at the bottom . Suspended cells and excess medium were removed from the chamber , leaving adhered cells and a thin film of liquid , with some areas of the chamber bottom appearing dry . The samples were imaged immediately . Microscopy was performed using a modified version of the laser-spot time-lapse microscope ( see Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Fluorescence excitation was achieved by near-TIRF ( \u201chighly inclined\u201d/\u201doblique\u201d ) illumination of the samples . Briefly , a fiber-coupled continuous wave ( CW ) diode laser ( Toptica iChrome HP , 488 nm , Toptica , Germany ) was injected into the epifluorescence port of the microscope via the dichroic mirror . The fiber , collimator , quarter-wave plate and TIR-lens ( Thorlabs AC254-200-A-ML , Thorlabs , UK ) were mounted on a translation stage and positioned such that the focused beam was centered at the back focal plane ( BFP ) of the Olympus 100\u00d7 objective lens ( UPON TIRF 1 . 49 NA oil ) ( Olympus , Japan ) . By adjusting the translation stage , the position of the beam could be translated across the BFP to adjust the inclination angle of the beam through the sample . Images were captured using the green channel using a GFP filter set ( Semrock FF01-520/35-25 , Semrock , Rochester , NY ) and an exposure time of 100 ms . Average images were generated by frame averaging over 1\u20132 s . Measurements were taken from a single experimental run , representative of images recorded for three separate cultures of Synechocystis torA-gfp . Fluorescent profiles for spot intensity and FWHM measurements were obtained from the intensity profile of hand-fitted spline curves to the circumference of the cell image starting at the edge opposite to the focus spot ( proximal to illumination source ) and tracing in an anti-clockwise direction back to the origin . The line width was 3 pixels and the analysis was done in ImageJ . Permanent EPON epoxy-based photosensitive resin ( SU-8 3000 series , MicroChem , Westborough , MA ) with outstandingly low absorption in the near-UV range ( LaBianca and Gelorme , 1995 ) was applied on pre-cleaned silicon wafers by spin coating . SU-8 3005 was coated at a final rotation speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s , after which the photosensitive film was subjected to a soft bake at 95\u00b0C for 5 hr . Droplets ( 4 \u03bcl ) of an exponentially growing Synechocystis culture in BG11 medium were dispensed on top of the 5 \u00b5m thick photoresist . The BG11 medium evaporated under standard clean-room conditions after 30 min , leaving the Synechocystis cells on top of the wafer . Flood exposure of the photopolymer was performed at a center wavelength of 365 nm ( MA6 exposure system , Karl Suess , S\u00dcSS MicroTec AG , Germany ) . The exposure dose of 85 mJ cm\u20132 was found by a lithographic series , in order to achieve sharp rendering of scattering patterns on the SU-8 film . However , the SU-8 layer was not exposed entirely and rendered a height-dependent cross-linked structure similar to grayscale lithography ( Gal , 1994 ) . Height profiles of the scattering pattern were obtained by atomic force microscopy ( tapping-mode , Dimension Icon , Bruker Nano Surfaces Division , Santa Barbara , CA ) . Completely exposed SU-8 patterns had a median roughness of Ra = 3 . 2 nm . From the scattering patterns , a mean of six axially symmetric profiles was computed in order to average out the influence of surface roughness . The optical field distribution was computed by the FDTD method . The algorithm solves the time-dependent Maxwell curl equations by using discrete time steps and leads to a time-resolved evolution of the spatial electromagnetic field distribution ( Yee , 1966 ) . We used a freeware FDTD implementation by Schmidt ( Schmidt , 2013 ) . The material interface geometry , including assignment of refractive index values to material regions , as well as the incoming light source properties were required to initiate the simulation process . The subsequent FDTD solution process was controlled by specifying a space and time grid ( \u0394x = \u0394y = 10 nm , \u0394t = 10\u20138 s ) . Wild-type motile Synechocystis cells were freshly plated in a line on motility plates and grown overnight at 30\u00b0C with directional illumination ( ~10 \u00b5mol photons m\u20132 s\u20131 ) in a standing incubator . Fingers of cells projecting 0 . 3\u20130 . 5 cm were seen after ~16 hrs . The leading edges of the fingers were collected and resuspended in 20\u201350 \u00b5l of BG11 medium and spotted onto freshly made motility plates and left to adsorb . Blocks of the motility agarose containing the spots were excised from the plate and inverted onto 35 mm glass-bottomed tissue-culture dishes for imaging in a custom-built inverted microscope . The time\u00a0lapse microscope ( see Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) was constructed on the base of an Olympus IX81 microscope , using an Olympus 40\u00d7 ( UPLANFLUOR 0 . 75 NA Air ) objective lens . Two air-cooled EMCCD cameras ( Andor iXon Ultra DU-897U-CS0-#BV , Andor , UK ) were coupled to the camera port of the microscope via a magnifying relay . The cameras were simultaneously triggered using a TTL pulse from an external\u00a0digital-to-analog ( D/A ) converter ( Data Translation DT9834 , Data Translation , Germany ) , with an exposure time of 50 ms and a frequency of 0 . 25 Hz . A dichroic mirror ( Semrock FF560-FDi01-25x36 ) in the Fourier plane of the camera relay split the emission into red ( fluorescence ) and green ( transmission bright-field imaging ) channels . Each channel had a separate band\u00a0pass filter ( Semrock BLP01-647R-25\u200b and Semrock FF01-520/35-25 ) . The focused laser spot was generated by expanding a collimated beam from a fiber-coupled CW diode laser ( Toptica iChrome HP , 640 nm ) , injected via the epifluorescence port of the microscope and directed to the objective lens via a dichroic filter ( Semrock Di01-R405/488/561/635-25x36 ) . The beam was expanded to overfill the back aperture of the objective lens to achieve a diffraction-limited spot at the focal plane . A combination of neutral density filters and a half-wave plate and polarizing beam splitter were used to adjust the power of the laser to approximately 0 . 01 \u03bcW as measured using a power meter . A 1:1 lens pair ( Thorlabs AC254-100-A-ML ) with one lens mounted on a Z-translation stage was used to adjust the axial position of the focus at the sample plane . A quarter-wave plate was used to circularly polarize the beam before it was injected into the microscope . Bright-field trans-illumination was performed by fiber-coupling a 530 nm LED ( Thorlabs M530F1 ) into a multimode fiber and imaging the magnified end of the fiber at the sample plane using a condenser lens . The LED was TTL triggered via the camera acquisition to reduce light exposure to the cells , resulting in a synchronized 50 ms pulse during acquisition . A third LED ( 625 nm , 3 mW ) was mounted close to the sample at an oblique angle to provide directional illumination for the motility assay . Light intensities were measured with a silicon photodiode-based power meter ( Thorlabs S120C and PM100D ) . Acquisition was performed over 30 min . All the data shown in Figure 4 are from a single continuous experiment , representative of 5 such experiments carried out under comparable conditions ."}

Mitochondria constantly divide ( a process known as fission ) or fuse together , which helps to keep them in good working condition and well distributed around the cell . Several neurological disorders , including Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s , are associated with problems that affect mitochondrial fission . Many different molecules work together to help mitochondria divide , including a protein called Drp1 . A number of Drp1 molecules can associate with each other to form an \u201coligomer\u201d in the shape of a ring around a mitochondrion . The ring then constricts to split the mitochondrion in two . It is often assumed that Drp1 molecules are recruited to the mitochondria immediately before fission and then form the oligomer ring . However , by using microscopy to track the movement of fluorescently labeled Drp1 molecules in human cells , Ji , Hatch et al . now suggest that Drp1 is continuously binding to and releasing from mitochondria , regardless of the need for fission . The experiments showed that when bound to surface of the mitochondrion , Drp1 switches between assembling and disassembling the oligomer ring . This process of Drp1 assembly and oligomerization on mitochondria is called maturation . Specific signals for fission can push Drp1 toward maturation , which then leads to fission . Ji , Hatch et al . found that one such signal is the assembly of filaments of a protein called actin . Preventing actin filaments from forming reduced the amount of Drp1 that accumulated at mitochondria , and resulted in the mitochondria dividing less frequently . Further biochemical experiments also revealed that actin interacts directly with Drp1 and stimulates Drp1 activity , helping the ring to organize and assist mitochondrial fission . The formation of actin filaments is not the only mechanism that can recruit Drp1 to mitochondria . Future work should investigate whether other mechanisms work with actin to recruit Drp1 . As with actin filaments , other signals might be predicted to influence the balance of maturation and disassembly of Drp1 oligomers .", "source": "While the dynamin GTPase Drp1 plays a critical role during mitochondrial fission , mechanisms controlling its recruitment to fission sites are unclear . A current assumption is that cytosolic Drp1 is recruited directly to fission sites immediately prior to fission . Using live-cell microscopy , we find evidence for a different model , progressive maturation of Drp1 oligomers on mitochondria through incorporation of smaller mitochondrially-bound Drp1 units . Maturation of a stable Drp1 oligomer does not forcibly lead to fission . Drp1 oligomers also translocate directionally along mitochondria . Ionomycin , a calcium ionophore , causes rapid mitochondrial accumulation of actin filaments followed by Drp1 accumulation at the fission site , and increases fission rate . Inhibiting actin polymerization , myosin IIA , or the formin INF2 reduces both un-stimulated and ionomycin-induced Drp1 accumulation and mitochondrial fission . Actin filaments bind purified Drp1 and increase GTPase activity in a manner that is synergistic with the mitochondrial protein Mff , suggesting a role for direct Drp1/actin interaction . We propose that Drp1 is in dynamic equilibrium on mitochondria in a fission-independent manner , and that fission factors such as actin filaments target productive oligomerization to fission sites . \n Mitochondrial fission and fusion create a dynamic network that is necessary for mitochondrial distribution and homeostasis . During mitosis , fission is necessary to distribute mitochondria between daughter cells . In neurons , fission and transport maintains mitochondrial distribution throughout the length of these highly polarized cells . Mitochondrial fission is also a fundamental step during mitophagy , a quality control mechanism that removes damaged mitochondrial segments . Dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics are linked to multiple neurological disorders , such as Alzheimer\u2019s , Huntington\u2019s , Parkinson\u2019s , hereditary ataxia , and Charcot-Marie Tooth disease ( Chen and Chan , 2009; Nunnari and Suomalainen , 2012; Girard et al . , 2012; Niemann et al . , 2005 ) . The dynamin-like GTPase Drp1 is a central component of the fission machinery , with Drp1 oligomerization and constriction providing a driving force for the process . Drp1 is a cytosolic protein that translocates to the outer mitochondrial membrane ( OMM ) ( Smirnova et al . , 2001 ) . In solution , Drp1 exists in a number of oligomeric states , including dimers , tetramers , and higher-order oligomers ( Fr\u00f6hlich et al . , 2013; Macdonald et al . , 2014 ) . Membrane-bound oligomeric Drp1 induces tubulation of associated membrane , and constricts the membrane in the presence of GTP ( Francy et al . , 2015; Mears et al . , 2011 ) . Drp1 can bind to the OMM through several factors , including the mitochondrial-specific lipid cardiolipin ( Macdonald et al . , 2014; Stepanyants et al . , 2015; Bustillo-Zabalbeitia et al . , 2014; Ugarte-Uribe et al . , 2014 ) ; and several \u2018receptors\u2019 on the OMM , such as Mff , MiD49 , and MiD51 ( Richter et al . , 2015 ) . What mechanisms target specific sites on mitochondria for fission ? Recent findings have shed light on this question . The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) forms close contacts with mitochondria at the eventual fission site ( Friedman et al . , 2011 ) . Actin polymerization at the ER-mitochondrial interface may be a key component , controlled by the ER-bound formin INF2 ( Korobova et al . , 2013 ) and the mitochondrially-bound Spire1C protein ( Manor et al . , 2015 ) . Myosin II activity also plays a role in this pathway ( DuBoff et al . , 2012; Korobova et al . , 2014 ) . Inhibition of actin polymerization , myosin II activity , or INF2 causes decreased levels of mitochondrially-bound Drp1 oligomers , suggesting that actin and myosin are acting at the level of Drp1 recruitment . Two additional actin binding proteins , cortactin and cofilin , have also been linked to mitochondrial fission ( Li et al . , 2015 ) . Given the number of factors that can mediate Drp1 recruitment to the OMM , as well as the necessity for Drp1 oligomerization at the fission site , a fundamental question concerns the relationship between Drp1 recruitment , oligomerization , and fission . We envision two possible models for the process , termed de novo assembly and targeted equilibrium . In de novo assembly , cytosolic Drp1 is recruited specifically to fission sites , where it oligomerizes and mediates fission in a concerted series of steps in response to fission signals ( which include OMM receptors , cardiolipin and actin ) . In targeted equilibrium , Drp1 maintains a constant equilibrium between cytosolic and mitochondrial pools , as well as between dimer and oligomer . These equilibria are independent of fission . Fission signals shift these equilibria toward stable oligomerization at targeted fission sites on the OMM . While few studies address the order of events during Drp1 recruitment , de novo assembly is often tacitly assumed ( Otera et al . , 2013; Elgass et al . , 2015; Labb\u00e9 et al . , 2014 ) . Here , we show evidence supporting targeted equilibrium . We observe that mitochondrially-bound Drp1 oligomers mature into stable oligomers through a series of merging events . Some of these Drp1 oligomers are motile\u2014capable of translocating on the mitochondrial surface before engaging in fission . Notably , not all mitochondrially-bound Drp1 oligomers engage in fission . Using ionomycin treatment to induce mitochondrial fission , we show that actin polymerization precedes Drp1 oligomerization , and that actin enriches with Drp1 at fission sites . Inhibition of actin polymerization , INF2 or myosin II decreases ionomycin-induced Drp1 accumulation and mitochondrial fission . Biochemically , actin filaments bind Drp1 directly and enhance its GTPase activity , suggesting that actin filaments can organize Drp1 into a productive oligomer . These results suggest that actin promotes fission by facilitating productive oligomerization of Drp1 on the OMM . \n To monitor Drp1 dynamics in live cells , we developed a U2OS cell line stably expressing GFP-Drp1 with partial shRNA suppression of endogenous Drp1 ( gDrp-U2OS ) . By quantitative western blotting , gDrp-U2OS cells maintain 1 . 64-fold total Drp1 levels compared to control U2OS cells , with 56% endogenous Drp1 and 44% GFP-Drp1 ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . Mitochondrial morphology appears similar between control U2OS and gDrp-U2OS cells ( not shown ) . We also developed a live-cell assay to measure mitochondrial fission rate , in which peripheral cellular regions are imaged over 10 min for dynamics of a fluorescent mitochondrial marker . Fission events are scored based on stable separation of the marker , and similar fission rates are obtained with either a matrix marker or an OMM marker ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Using this assay , the fission rates of control U2OS and gDrp1-U2OS cells are statistically similar ( 1 . 26 \u00b1 1 . 01 versus 1 . 51 \u00b1 0 . 69 fission events per mm mitochondrion per min , p = 0 . 49 ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . Additionally , a second clone displaying undetectable endogenous Drp1 levels and GFP-Drp1 levels ~3 . 5-fold higher than control Drp1 levels displays similar mitochondrial fission frequency to control cells ( Figure 1 , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013G ) , suggesting that GFP-Drp1 functionally compensates for endogenous Drp1 in these cells . We used the gDrp1-U2OS line for subsequent studies , due to its overall Drp1 levels being closer to those of control cells . By live-cell confocal microscopy , much of the GFP-Drp1 in gDrp-U2OS cells appears diffuse in the cytoplasm ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . However , adjusting the fluorescence threshold to eliminate this diffuse signal reveals abundant Drp1 \u2018puncta\u2019 of varying intensity ( Figure 1A , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A , B ) , likely representing Drp1 oligomers . We arbitrarily defined two categories of puncta: \u2018total\u2019 puncta , including all Drp1 signal over the diffuse background; and \u2018high-threshold\u2019 puncta , representing the brightest 30% of Drp1 puncta . These designations do not represent two distinct pools of intensity , as the distribution of punctum intensity is continuous ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . Here , we use these categories to distinguish between smaller puncta and those approaching maximal size . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 003Figure 1 . Mitochondrial association of Drp1 puncta .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 005 We employed a particle-tracking algorithm to analyze punctum position and lifetime relative to a mitochondrial matrix marker ( Figure 1C ) . Approximately 49% of total puncta and 70% of high-threshold puncta co-localize with mitochondria at individual frames in the viewing period ( Figure 1B ) . For most puncta , mitochondrial association is transient ( Video 1 ) , with mean lifetimes of 45 . 0 \u00b1 104 . 8 s and 64 . 4 \u00b1 113 . 1 s for total and high-threshold puncta , respectively ( 3582 and 1601 puncta analyzed ) . The largest population of puncta remains bound < 12 s in both cases ( Figure 1C ) , although the high-threshold puncta are significantly more stably associated with mitochondria ( p<0 . 001 for lifetime comparison ) . Puncta density on mitochondria does not vary systematically with mitochondrial length , with approximately 0 . 41 total puncta and 0 . 17 high-threshold puncta per \u03bcm mitochondrial length ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 006Video 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 006 How do Drp1 puncta assemble on mitochondria ? We observed three distinct dynamic behaviors associated with mitochondrially-bound Drp1 puncta: punctum merging , punctum motility , and mitochondrial fission . Mitochondrially-bound puncta frequently merge together , with successive merging events resulting in punctum growth ( Figure 2A , B , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A , Video 2 , 3 ) . Merging is a reversible process , and can be followed by splitting of the merged punctum ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B , Video 4 ) . The combination of these results suggests that a population of Drp1 is in rapid equilibrium between the cytosol and the OMM , and that one mechanism for assembly of larger Drp1 oligomers is through merging of mitochondrially-bound oligomers . We refer to this process as \u2018maturation\u2019 . Imaging at higher resolution by Airyscan microscopy suggests that maturing puncta are loosely associated with the mitochondrion , and progressively encircle the mitochondrion as they mature ( Figure 2C , Video 5 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 007Figure 2 .

In addition , a sub-set of high-threshold Drp1 puncta translocates directionally along mitochondria for short distances at a mean velocity of 46 . 9 \u00b1 12 . 8 nm/sec ( Figure 3A , B ) . Assessing the fraction of motile puncta is challenging due to the underlying motility of the mitochondrion itself , thus our analysis is limited to situations where mitochondria are visibly stationary during the viewing period . Motile high-threshold puncta are capable of stopping abruptly and engaging in fission ( Figure 3A , Video 6 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 013Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 015 We next assessed the correlation between Drp1 puncta and mitochondrial fission , and found that all observed fission events are associated with high-threshold Drp1 puncta ( 49 events , examples in Figure 1A , Figure 2A , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A , Figure 3A ) . However , only a low percentage of Drp1 puncta ( 2 . 5% of total puncta and 6 . 3% of high threshold puncta ) engages in observable fission events during the 10 min imaging period . Even for productive puncta , the lag between punctum establishment and mitochondrial fission varies significantly , with a mean of 76 . 0 \u00b1 40 . 3 s ( Figure 3D ) that appears to be independent of mitochondrial length ( Figure 3E ) . These results suggest that establishment of an apparently stable mitochondrially-bound Drp1 oligomer is not sufficient , and that additional steps are required to drive fission . We made two additional observations concerning mitochondrial fission . First , mitochondria undergoing fission tend to be longer than the mean ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Second , Drp1 remains at newly created mitochondrial ends for a significant time after fission . This residual Drp1 can be asymmetrically distributed , with one end inheriting most or all residual Drp1 ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D ) . We examined Drp1 puncta at higher spatial resolution by live-cell 3D-structured illumination microscopy ( 3D-SIM ) , using Tom20-mCherry as the mitochondrial marker in order to label the OMM . We analyzed diameters of both mitochondria and associated Drp1 puncta for \u2018productive\u2019 events ( leading to fission ) and non-productive events ( sites of stable Drp1 puncta that did not undergo fission during observation ) . The mean mitochondrial diameter in the absence of Drp1 is 322 \u00b1 64 nm ( Figure 4B ) . Non-productive high-threshold Drp1 puncta still cause significant constriction ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) , with mean mitochondrial diameter of 215 \u00b1 50 nm ( Figure 4B ) and Drp1 diameter of 270 \u00b1 38 nm ( Figure 4C ) at these sites . This constriction is maintained over time ( Figure 4D ) . Productive Drp1 puncta undergo significant contraction immediately prior to fission , with mean Drp1 diameter of 200 \u00b1 31 nm in the frame prior to fission ( Figure 4C , D , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B , Video 7 , 8 ) . The mitochondrial diameter in this frame is 134 \u00b1 25 nm , which is at the limit of resolution for 3D-SIM . Our results are qualitatively similar to those obtained from fixed-cell PALM studies ( Rosenbloom et al . , 2014 ) , while adding the dynamic component of contraction prior to fission . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 016Figure 4 .

These puncta appear to distort as they translocate , periodically separating into strands ( Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A , Video 9 , 10 ) . Dynamic shape changes are not characteristic of stable puncta , which can be most easily appreciated when viewing a punctum transitioning from motile to stationary ( Figure 5B ) . Motile puncta appear to encircle the mitochondrion to a significant degree , although the spatial resolution achieved here is not sufficient to answer this question definitively . Punctum velocity in 3D-SIM is similar to that measured by confocal microscopy ( 48 . 5 \u00b1 17 . 1 nm/sec , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 020Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 023 What signal might stimulate Drp1 punctum maturation ? We previously showed that mitochondrial length increased upon three cellular treatments: inhibition of actin polymerization by Latrunculin A ( LatA ) , siRNA suppression of the formin protein INF2 , or inhibition of myosin II by chemical inhibitors or siRNA ( Korobova et al . , 2013; Korobova et al . , 2014 ) . The increase in mitochondrial length suggests a fission defect , but could also reflect changes in mitochondrial fusion . Here , we establish that the effect is on mitochondrial fission , using our live-cell fission assay . Suppression of either INF2 or myosin IIA causes an ~50% decrease in fission rate , whereas Drp1 suppression or expression of the dominant-negative Drp1 K38A mutant cause near-complete inhibition ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . In addition , suppression of either INF2 or myosin IIA reduces mitochondrially-associated Drp1 puncta , with a moderate reduction of total Drp1 puncta ( 2 . 7-fold for both INF2 and myosin IIA ) and a larger reduction in high threshold puncta ( 6 . 7-fold and 8 . 3-fold , respectively , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . LatA treatment also causes a reduction in mitochondrially-associated Drp1 puncta , although the degree of high threshold reduction is not as great as for INF2 or myosin IIA suppression ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . These results support the previous results suggesting a role for actin polymerization in mitochondrial Drp1 assembly . We next examined the relationship between actin filaments and Drp1 during mitochondrial fission by live-cell microscopy in gDrp-U2OS cells . One challenge is the abundance of actin-based structures in U2OS cells . To mitigate this issue , we imaged cells at a focal plane significantly above the ventral surface , where there are fewer actin-based structures such as stress fibers . In this region , we observed frequent examples of actin filaments accumulating prior to fission ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A , Video 11 ) , but the overall actin filament abundance in the region remained a challenge for determining whether its presence might contribute to fission . To assess the significance of the actin accumulation , we calculated the mean percentage of mitochondrial area covered by actin ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B ) , and compared this number to the percentage of fission events at which actin was present immediately prior to fission . We found that a significantly higher percentage of fission events ( 56% ) were associated with actin filaments than would be expected by random correlation ( 28% , n = 59 fission events , Figure 6\u2014 figure supplement 2C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 024Video 11 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 024 While this correlation is suggestive , the low frequency of fission events is challenging for temporal correlation of actin and Drp1 accumulation prior to fission . To examine this relationship in more detail , we used ionomycin , a calcium ionophore , to increase mitochondrial fission rate ( Tan et al . , 2011; Sanmartin et al . , 2014 ) . A recent publication showed that 3T3 cells respond to increased cytosolic calcium with an acute burst of actin polymerization throughout the cytosol , mediated by INF2 ( Shao et al . , 2015 ) . We find a similar ionomycin-induced actin burst in gDrp-U2OS cells ( 16 . 9 \u00b1 8 . 7% signal increase , t1/2 28 . 1 \u00b1 19 . 8 s ) followed by a rapid decline ( Figure 6A ) . Ionomycin treatment also increases mitochondrial fission rate 3 . 9-fold ( 2 . 61 \u00b1 1 . 01 vs 10 . 23 \u00b1 5 . 41 events mm-1 min-1 ) ( Figure 6B ) . Similar fission rate increases occur when using mitochondrial matrix markers tagged with either dsRed or BFP ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 025Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 029 We next asked whether the quantity of Drp1 oligomers also increased following ionomycin treatment , initially monitoring total Drp1 puncta . Indeed , ionomycin treatment causes Drp1 oligomer signal increases from 10-20% , depending on the experiment , with a consistent t1/2\u00a0of 99 . 9 \u00b1 19 . 0 s ( Figure 6A , also see Figure 7A , C and D ) . In contrast to the transient actin increase , the Drp1 oligomer signal remains elevated for >10 min . These measurements are rapid to conduct , allowing analysis of every time point in the sequence , but do not provide information on the change in mitochondrially-bound Drp1 puncta . For this reason , we also quantified the change in the number of mitochondrially-associated Drp1 puncta upon ionomycin treatment on a more limited set of time points , and found ~40% increase for low- or high-threshold puncta ( Figure 6C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 030Figure 7 .

At 60 s after starting imaging , cells were treated with 4 \u03bcM ionomycin ( in the presence of the appropriate concentration of LatA ) and imaged for 9 min . GFP-Drp1 signals over cytosolic background ( background subtract , ImageJ ) were measured per whole cell; actin filament signals were quantified from two or three ROIs per cell ( approximately 3\u00a0\u00d7 3\u00a0\u03bcm ) , in which no stress fibers or cell edges were included .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 030 In addition , we visually monitored the dynamics of actin and Drp1 at individual ionomycin-induced fission sites by Airyscan microscopy . Prior to ionomycin treatment , a number of low intensity Drp1 puncta dynamically associate with mitochondria , and a meshwork of actin exists throughout the cytoplasm ( Figure 6D , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4 , Video 12 ) . This actin meshwork enriches at certain positions on mitochondria , and Drp1 puncta tend to be more abundant at these sites but are dynamic . Upon ionomycin treatment , the actin signal intensifies throughout the cytosol , particularly at sites of mitochondrial crossover . Drp1 puncta mature at these actin-enriched sites , and some of these sites undergo fission while others undergo constriction but no fission during the viewing period ( Figure 6D , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4 , Video 12 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 031Video 12 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 031 We tested the association between actin and Drp1 further by inhibiting actin polymerization , followed by ionomycin stimulation . Pre-treatment for 15 min with LatA abolishes both Drp1 accumulation ( Figure 7A , B ) and the increase in mitochondrial fission ( Figure 6B ) . Suppression of INF2 by siRNA treatment potently inhibits the actin increase , but causes a smaller decrease in whole-cell Drp1 oligomer accumulation than that achieved by LatA ( Figure 7C ) . However , the effect of INF2 suppression on mitochondrially-associated high threshold Drp1 puncta is dramatic , with almost complete elimination of the ionomycin-induced increase ( Figure 6C Right ) . INF2 suppression also causes a decrease in ionomycin-induced mitochondrial fission ( Figure 6B ) . Interestingly , INF2 suppression has a negligible effect on Drp1 puncta of lower intensity ( Figure 6C Left ) . These results suggest that INF2-mediated actin polymerization plays a role in Drp1 maturation on mitochondria . We next tested the role of myosin II in this process . Suppression of myosin IIA does not alter the actin response to ionomycin ( signal intensity increase 20 . 0 \u00b1 6 . 4% with t1/2 of 22 . 8 \u00b1 12 . 7 s ) , but strongly reduces Drp1 oligomerization ( Figure 7D ) and mitochondrial fission ( Figure 6B ) . These experiments suggest that both INF2-induced actin polymerization and myosin II activity are important pre-requisites for productive Drp1 oligomer assembly . The mechanism by which actin might stimulate Drp1 accumulation is unclear . One possibility is that Drp1 binds directly to actin filaments at the fission site , similar to the direct binding between dynamin and actin ( Gu et al . , 2010; Palmer et al . , 2015; Mooren et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , a previous study demonstrates that actin accumulates at clathrin-mediated endocytosis sites prior to dynamin 2 arrival ( Grassart et al . , 2014 ) . We tested the possibility of a direct interaction using purified proteins . Through co-sedimentation assay , Drp1 binds actin with an apparent Kd of 0 . 8 \u00b1 0 . 4 \u03bcM ( Figure 8A , Figure 8\u2014 figure supplement 1A ) . Interestingly , less than 50% of the Drp1 binds actin filaments even at saturating actin concentrations ( Figure 8A ) . This situation is not caused by a significant pool of \u2018inactive\u2019 Drp1 in our purified preparation , since >90% of the Drp1 pellets when incubated with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . We postulate that partial binding is due to differential affinities of Drp1 oligomeric states for actin filaments . In these assays , Drp1 does not change the critical concentration of actin , since actin polymerizes to a similar extent in the absence or presence of Drp1 ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 032Figure 8 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 033 By total internal reflection ( TIRF ) microscopy , GFP-tagged Drp1 binds evenly throughout the actin filament ( Figure 8B ) , with no apparent preference for specific filament regions ( Figure 8C , Video 13 ) . By negative-stain electron microscopy , Drp1-bound filaments have mean widths of 27 . 2 \u00b1 1 . 3 nm , compared to 8 . 9 \u00b1 0 . 2 nm for actin alone ( Figure 8D ) . It is unclear whether this increased width is due to Drp1 binding a single filament or to Drp1-mediated filament bundling . The width of a Drp1 dimer is 22 . 9 nm ( Fr\u00f6hlich et al . , 2013 ) , similar to our measured width . However , Drp1 can induce filament bundling , as evidenced by TIRF microscopy ( Figure 8E , Video 14 ) . Indeed , time-lapse imaging of the bundling process suggests that filaments have a preferred bundled orientation , and can be end-bound to the sides of Drp1-bound filaments prior to bundling ( Figure 8F , Video 15 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 034Video 13 .

We tested whether actin filaments could also increase Drp1\u2019s GTPase activity and found a ~3 . 5-fold increase ( Figure 9A ) . An additional question is whether actin filaments can synergize with Drp1 receptors on the OMM . We tested this possibility using the cytosolic portion of Mff . Mff alone causes only a slight increase in Drp1 GTPase activity at the concentrations tested . However , the combination of Mff and actin filaments causes a substantial increase in Drp1 activity , far beyond the additive effects of either Mff or actin alone ( Figure 9B ) . These results show that Drp1 binds actin filaments in a manner that stimulates its catalytic activity , and that actin filaments can synergize with Mff to increase productive Drp1 oligomerization . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 037Figure 9 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 037 \n Overall , our results support several important and novel features of Drp1 oligomerization . Rather than being an \u2018all or none\u2019 process in which Drp1 oligomerization at the fission site is induced de novo by fission signals , we postulate that both Drp1 oligomerization and mitochondrial association are in constant equilibrium even in the absence of fission signals . Fission signals serve to \u2018target\u2019 this equilibrium to fission sites . Actin filaments are one such fission signal . We illustrate these features as a three-stage model for fission-productive Drp1: recruitment , maturation , and conversion ( Figure 10 ) . In recruitment , \u2018units\u2019 of Drp1 are in rapid equilibrium between cytosolic and mitochondrially-bound pools . These Drp1 units diffuse on the OMM , and merge to form larger units . Maturation is the progressive association of mitochondrially-bound Drp1 units , leading to assembly of an oligomer that fully encircles the mitochondrion . The size of the mature oligomer is unclear , but might be similar to the 26-40 subunits found for dynamin2 ( Grassart et al . , 2014; Cocucci et al . , 2014 ) . Mature oligomers are capable of movement along the OMM . Conversion represents a distinct process in which a site containing a stable Drp1 oligomer is rendered fission-competent . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 038Figure 10 . Model for assembly of fission-productive Drp1 on mitochondria . Step 1: recruitment . Drp1 units are in equilibrium between cytosol and OMM , possibly binding to OMM receptors such as Mff , MiD49 , MiD51 , or Fis1 , or to cardiolipin . We suggest that several distinct oligomeric species may interact with the OMM . Step 2: maturation . Mitochondrially-bound Drp1 oligomers grow through incorporation of other mitochondrially-bound oligomers , progressively encircling the OMM in the process . The larger Drp1 oligomers constrict the OMM but are not yet competent to drive fission . Step 3: conversion . A stable Drp1 oligomer becomes productive for mitochondrial fission ( change from green to blue ) , with increased Drp1 ring constriction driving membrane ingression . Actin filaments and myosin II clearly stimulate the maturation process , with possible effects on recruitment as well . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11553 . 038 This model raises many new testable questions . First , what is the complete list of \u201cfission signals\u201d ? There is evidence that OMM proteins such as Mff , MiD49/51 , and Fis1 , as well as cardiolipin exposure on the OMM , can serve as fission signals . We postulate that actin filaments in proximity to the mitochondrion are another such signal . Other potential factors that might influence fission could include mitochondrial length and mitochondrial branches . We find that fission events occur disproportionately on longer mitochondria , but we do not find an increase in Drp1 puncta density on longer mitochondria , suggesting that maturation is not favored on long mitochondria . It should be realized , however , that most mitochondria exist in a branched network in these cells . The relationship between mitochondrial branching and mitochondrial fission is a fascinating question still to be addressed . Second , do the various fission signals act in series or in parallel ? In other words , do the signals work together within the same fission pathway , or act in alternate pathways ? Both options could be true , depending on the fission signal . For example , we postulate that actin filaments and cardiolipin might represent alternate maturation factors , since both are polyvalent anions . In contrast , actin filaments could work in concert with Mff , either in \u201ccoincidence detection\u201d by Drp1 ( Hatch et al . , 2014 ) or by actin filaments serving as a reservoir for delivery of Drp1 oligomers to Mff . Recent work has shown that Mff binds preferentially to oligomerized Drp1 ( Liu and Chan , 2015 ) , which is consistent with this possibility . We show here that actin filaments and Mff synergize in stimulating Drp1\u2019s GTPase activity . A final possibility is that specific fission factors mediate distinct steps in the process . For example , a recent study on the membrane-altering ability of the Drp1-cardiolipin interaction might suggest that cardiolipin triggers a conversion step ( Stepanyants et al . , 2015 ) . Third , what is the size of the Drp1 \u2018unit\u2019 that is recruited to mitochondria ? We cannot detect the smallest oligomers ( dimers , tetramers ) in this study for several reasons , including: our threshold procedure forcibly removes these from analysis , and only ~ half of the Drp1 in these cells is GFP-labeled . The available data suggest that the recruited unit may be mixed oligomers of GFP-labeled and endogenous Drp1 . Recent biochemical studies have shown that Drp1 exists in equilibrium between oligomeric states in solution , with some evidence that dimers are the relevant membrane-recruited unit in the case of cardiolipin binding ( Fr\u00f6hlich et al . , 2013; Macdonald et al . , 2014 ) . On the other hand , in the present study we observe clear instances of Drp1 puncta apparently translocating from cytosol to mitochondrion . We state \u2018apparently\u2019 because it is possible that these oligomers transfer from another membrane or a cytoskeletal structure . Based on these findings , we postulate that a range of oligomeric species can be recruited to mitochondria , but that their on- and off-rates might vary considerably . Fourth , what steps are stimulated by actin ? Our data show that inhibiting actin polymerization inhibits the accumulation of Drp1 oligomers , suggestive of roles in either recruitment or maturation . Direct Drp1 binding to actin filaments near mitochondria might enhance initial mitochondrial binding , or might accelerate oligomerization steps of cytosolic Drp1 prior to mitochondrial interaction , both of which would aid recruitment . Alternately , actin binding to mitochondrially-bound Drp1 might enhance oligomerization on the mitochondrial surface , which would represent maturation . The two possibilities are not mutually exclusive . A related question is: what is myosin II\u2019s role in the process ? One possibility is that myosin II activity might lead to Drp1-independent \u2018pre-constriction\u2019 of the OMM , as we have proposed previously ( Korobova et al . , 2014; Hatch et al . , 2014 ) . It is also possible that myosin II organizes the INF2-assembled actin filaments in a manner optimal for Drp1 recruitment and/or maturation . Fifth , what are the roles of other actin binding proteins that have been identified as contributing to mitochondrial fission , such as cortactin , cofilin , and Spire 1C ( Manor et al . , 2015; Li et al . , 2015 ) ? There is evidence that mitochondrially-bound Spire 1C and ER-bound INF2 work through the same pathway , suggesting that Spire 1C might serve as a nucleation factor and INF2 as an elongation factor and/or a severing protein . Spire proteins cooperate with other formin proteins in a similar manner ( Vizcarra et al . , 2011; Quinlan , 2013 ) . Roles for cortactin and cofilin in the same pathway as Spire 1C/INF2 are possible , but an alternative is that they contribute to a distinct actin-dependent pathway . The fact that steady-state fission rate is only partially reduced by INF2 or myosin IIA suppression ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) suggests some degree of functional redundancy . Sixth , does the conversion step represent a change in Drp1 structure/activity , or changes in other fission components ? One possibility is recruitment of additional necessary molecules . For example , recent publications show that endophilin co-operates with actin and dynamin in clathrin-independent endocytosis ( Boucrot et al . , 2015; Renard et al . , 2015 ) . Alternately , exposure of cardiolipin on the OMM could trigger a conversion step , as mentioned above ( Macdonald et al . , 2014 ) . Seventh , how does ionomycin stimulate mitochondrial fission ? We postulate that , in addition to the known effect of calcium on Drp1 phosphorylation state ( Cribbs and Strack , 2007 ) , increased cytosolic calcium activates INF2 , as demonstrated in recent work ( Shao et al . , 2015 ) ( R . Wedlich-S\u00f6ldner , personal communication ) . These effects are likely to be similar to those induced by the Listeria protein LLO ( Stavru et al . , 2013 ) , which is also a calcium ionophore . Eighth , what is the role of the ER in mitochondrial fission ? The tight association of ER with mitochondria at fission sites ( Friedman et al . , 2011 ) could contribute in two ways . First , ER supplies the INF2 isoform responsible for actin dynamics at the fission site ( Korobova et al . , 2013; Manor et al . , 2015 ) . Second , ER might contribute to the calcium dynamics necessary for ionomycin-mediated fission , considering the complex relationship between extracellular calcium entry , calcium release from ER , and ER-mitochondrial calcium communication ( Horne and Meyer , 1997; Csord\u00e1s et al . , 1999 ) . Finally , what is the mechanism of Drp1 motility on mitochondria ? Our 3D-SIM time-lapse movies suggest that motile Drp1 oligomers are rings that encircle the mitochondrion , and that these rings change significantly during the motility process , in a manner similar to \u2018walking\u2019 along the mitochondrial surface . Another possible mechanism could be \u2018treadmilling\u2019 of Drp1 units , adding to one side of the Drp1 oligomer while dissociating from the other side , akin to cytoskeletal polymers . Furthermore , what is the purpose of this motility ? One possibility is something we call the \u2018night watchman\u2019 hypothesis , in which motility allows mature Drp1 oligomers to \u2018patrol\u2019 the mitochondrion in search of fission signals . \n Mito-DsRed and mito-BFP constructs were previously described ( Korobova et al . , 2014 ) , and consist of amino acids 1\u201322 of S . cerevisiae COX4 N-terminal to the respective fusion protein . mCherry-mito-7 was purchased from Addgene ( #55102 ) , and consists of the mitochondrial targeting sequence was from subunit VIII of human cytochrome C oxidase N-terminal to mCherry . Tom20-mCherry was a gift from Andrew G . York ( NIH , Bethesda , MD ) and described in York et al . ( 2013 ) . Drp1-containing plasmids ( GFP ( A206K ) -Drp1 and GFP ( A206K ) -Drp1 K38A ) were described in Strack et al . ( 2013 ) . These plasmids co-expresse H1 promoter\u2013driven shRNA for endogenous Drp1 as well as GFP-tagged , RNAi-resistant rat Drp1 . mApple-F-tractin plasmid was a gift from Clare Waterman and Ana Pasapera ( NIH , Bethesda , MD ) , and described in ( Johnson and Schell , 2009 ) . Human Mff isoform 8 cDNA ( Gandre-Babbe and van der Bliek , 2008 ) was amplified through RT-PCR from Hela cell RNA . Mff protein containing amino acids 1-197 ( NP_001263994 ) and Ala-2 Cys substitution , for protein labeling , was cloned into the pET21a ( Novagen ) vector using the NdeI and XhoI sites . Oligonucleotides for human total INF2 siRNA were synthesized by IDT Oligo against target sequence 5\u2019- GGAUCAACCUGGAGAUCAUCCGC-3\u2019 ( siRNA#1 ) , and 5\u2019- GCAGUACCGCUUCAGCAUUGUCA-3\u2019 ( siRNA#2 ) .

As a control , Silencer Negative Control 5\u2019-CGUUAAUCGCGUAUAAUACGCGUAT-3\u2019 ( Ambion ) was used . Human osteosarcoma U2OS ( obtained directly from American Type Culture Collection ( HTB-96 ) in 2014 ) were grown in DMEM ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) supplemented with 10% calf serum ( Atlanta Biologicals ) . The U2OS line was tested at regular intervals for mycoplasma contamination using LookOut Mycoplasma PCR detection kit ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . U2OS cells are not on the list of mis-identified or cross-contaminated cell lines compiled by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee ( ICLAC ) , and we have not had them verified by a third party . The stable GFP-Drp1 U2OS cell line ( gDrp1-U2OS ) . The gDrp1-U2OS cell line was made by transient transfection of the GFP ( A206K ) -Drp1 plasmid into U2OS cells , followed by selection in G418 . Selected cells were then flow-sorted for GFP signal as single cells onto 96-well plates , and individual clones were analyzed for GFP-Drp1 expression and endogenous Drp1 suppression . Cell lines we used for a maximum of 20 passages . For transfection of the U2OS or gDrp1-U2OS lines , cells were seeded at 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 cells per well of a 6-well dish ~16 hr prior to transfection . Plasmid transfections were performed in OPTI-MEM media ( Invitrogen ) with 2 \u03bcL Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) per well for 6 hr , followed by trypsinization and re-plating onto concanavalin A ( ConA , Sigma/Aldrich , Cat . No . C5275 ) - coated coverslips ( 25\u00a0mm , Electron microscopy Sciences , Cat . No . #72225-01 ) , at ~3 . 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 cells per well . Cells were imaged in live cell media ( Cat . No . 21063-029 , Life technologies ) , ~16\u201324 hr after transfection . For all experiments , the following amounts of DNA were transfected per well ( individually or combined for co-transfection ) : 400 ng for mito-BFP; 300 ng for GFP-Drp1 and GFP-Drp1 K38A constructs; 850 ng for Tom20-mCherry; 900 ng for mCherry-mito7; 500 ng for mApple-F-Tractin . For siRNA transfections , cells were plated on 6 well plates with 30\u201340% density , and 2 \u03bcl RNAimax ( Invitrogen ) and 63 pg of siRNA were used per well . Cells were analyzed 72\u201384 hr post-transfection for suppression . For Ionomycin treatment , gDrp1-U2OS cells were transfected with mitoBFP and mApple-F-tractin , as described above the day before imaging . Cells were mounted on the microscope for imaging , then treated with 4 \u03bcM Ionomycin ( from a 4 mM stock in DMSO , Sigma/Aldrich , Cat . No . I6034 ) at 20 frames ( 1 or 2 min , depends on time interval used ) during imaging . Medium was pre-equilibrated for temp and CO2 content before use . DMSO was used as the negative control . For Latrunculin A ( LatA ) pre-incubation followed by ionomycin treatment , cells were transfected with mitoBFP and mApple-F-tractin the day before treatment . Cells were incubated with live cell medium containing LatA ( added from a 0 . 2 mM DMSO stock ) for 15 min before imaging , and ionomycin was added at frame 20 ( 1 or 2 min depends on time intervals ) with DMSO used as the negative control . Cells were grown on 25 mm coverslips coated with ConA ( coverslips treated for ~2 hr with 100 \u03bcg/mL ConA in water at room temperature ) . Coverslips were mounted into flow chambers , then onto a Wave FX spinning disk confocal microscope ( Quorum Technologies , Inc . , Guelph , Canada , on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope ) , equipped with Hamamatsu ImageM EM CCD cameras and Bionomic Controller ( 20/20 Technology , Inc ) temperature-controlled stage set to 37\u00b0C . After equilibrating to temperature for 10 min , cells were imaged with the 60x 1 . 4 NA Plan Apo objective ( Nikon ) using the 403 nm and 450/50 filter for BFP , 491 nm laser and 525/20 filter for GFP , and the 561 nm laser and 593/40 filter for mApple or mCherry . Super-resolution 3D-SIM images were acquired on a DeltaVision OMX V4 ( GE Healthcare ) equipped with a 60x/1 . 42 NA PlanApo oil immersion objective ( Olympus ) , 405 , 488 , 568 and 642 nm solid state lasers ( 100\u00a0mW ) and sCMOS cameras ( pco . edge ) . Image stacks of 1 \u00b5m with 0 . 125 \u00b5m thick z-sections and 15 images per optical slice ( 3 angles and 5 phases ) with were acquired using immersion oil with a refractive index 1 . 524 . Images were reconstructed using Wiener filter settings of 0 . 005 and optical transfer functions ( OTFs ) measured specifically for each channel with SoftWoRx 6 . 1 . 3 ( GE Healthcare ) to obtain super-resolution images with a twofold increase in resolution both axially and laterally . Images from different color channels were registered using parameters generated from a gold grid registration slide ( GE Healthcare ) and SoftWoRx 6 . 1 . 3 ( GE Healthcare ) . Super resolution images were acquired on LSM 880 equipped with 63x/1 . 4 NA plan Apochromat oil objective , using the Airyscan detector ( Carl Zeiss Microscopy , Thornwood , NY ) . The Airyscan uses a 32-channel array of GaAsP detectors configured as 0 . 2 Airy Units per channel to collect the data that is subsequently processed using the Zen2 software . The processing involves an online reassignment of the pixel information followed by linear deconvolution . The end result is a 1 . 7-fold improvement in resolution in X , Y and Z and at least fourfold improvement in signal to noise ratio . gDrp1-U2OS cells transiently transfected with mitochondrial markers were imaged live by spin disc confocal fluorescence microscopy every 3 s for 10 min in a single focal plane . Regions of interest with readily resolvable mitochondria and Drp1 were processed as described in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A . We thresholded mitochondrially associated Drp1 puncta by using a ImageJ plugin , Colocalization , with the following parameters: Ratio 50% ( 0\u2013100% ) ; Threshold channel 1: 30 ( 0\u2013255 ) ; Threshold channel 2: 30 ( 0\u2013255 ) ; Display value: 255 ( 0\u2013255 ) . Mitochondrially associated Drp1 puncta were further analyzed by Trackmate V2 . 7 . 3 ( as described in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B , C ) to separate into total puncta and high threshold categories . Parameters used in Trackmate are: estimated blob diameter of 0 . 7 microns for confocal and 0 . 5 microns for SIM; LoG detector settings: tracker \u2013 LAP tracker , frame to frame linking of 1 micron , track segment gap-closing of 1 micron max distance and 1 frame max frame gap , track segment splitting of 1 micron , and track segment merging of 1 micron . The number of Drp1 puncta in each category were automatically counted frame-by-frame by ImageJ macro , Find Stack Maxima . Suitable ROI\u2019s were selected for analysis based on whether individual mitochondria were resolvable and did not leave the focal plane . Files of these ROIs were assembled , then coded and scrambled by one investigator , and analyzed for fission by a second investigator in a blinded manner as to the treatment condition . The second investigator scanned the ROIs frame-by-frame manually for fission events , and determined mitochondrial length within the ROI using the ImageJ macro , Mitochondrial Morphology ( described in Dagda et al . ( 2009 ) ) . The results were then given back to the first investigator for de-coding . For measuring lengths of individual mitochondria , ROIs were selected that enabled imaging of the entire mitochondrial length where possible . Due to the fact that the majority of mitochondrial mass is in the form of a branched mitochondrial \u2018network\u2019 in these cells , and that one end of the network is often in the peri-nuclear region which is difficult to resolve , it was frequently difficult to find both ends of the network , in which case the resolvable length was reported . Polyclonal antibodies against human INF2 N-terminus ( amino acids 1-424 ) or FH1-FH2- C ( amino acids 469-1249 , CAAX ) were raised in rabbits by Covance ( Denver , PA ) , and affinity purified using DID construct ( amino acids 1-269 ) or FH1-FH2 ( amino acids 469-940 ) coupled to Sulfolink ( Thermo/Pierce ) . Anti-Tubulin ( DM1-\u03b1 , Sigma/Aldrich ) was used at 1:10 , 000 dilution . Drp1 was detected using a rabbit monoclonal antibody ( Cell Signaling ) at 1:500 dilution . MyosinII-A was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody ( Cell Signaling ) at 1:500 dilution . For Western Blotting , cells were grown on 6 well plate , trypsinized , washed with PBS and resuspended 50 \u03bcL PBS . 50 \u03bcL was mixed with 34 \u03bcL of 10% SDS and 1 \u03bcL of 1 M DTT , boiled 5 min , cooled to 23\u00b0C , then 17 \u03bcl of 300 mM of freshly made NEM in water was added . Just before SDS-PAGE , the protein sample was mixed 1:1 with 2xDB ( 250 mM Tris-HCl pH 6 . 8 , 2 mM EDTA , 20% glycerol , 0 . 8% SDS , 0 . 02% bromophenol blue , 1000 mM NaCl , 4 M urea ) . Proteins were separated by 7 . 5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane ( polyvinylidine difluoride membrane , Millipore ) . The membrane was blocked with TBS-T ( 20 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 136 mM NaCl , and 0 . 1% Tween-20 ) containing 3% BSA ( Research Organics ) for 1 hr , then incubated with the primary antibody solution at 4\u00b0C overnight . After washing with TBS-T , the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) -conjugated secondary antibody ( Bio-Rad ) for 1 hr at room temperature . Signals were detected by Chemiluminescence ( Pierce ) . We expressed and purified Human Drp1 000 isoform ( Strack et al . , 2013 ) from S . cerevisiae and E . coli . Yeast-purified Drp1 was used for TIRF microscopy and negative staining electron microscopy . E . coli-purified Drp1 was used in high-speed co-sedimentation experiments and GTPase assays . Actin filaments were assembled from monomers ( 20 \u03bcM ) for 1 hr at 23\u00b0C by addition of a 10x stock of polymerization buffer ( 500 mM NaCl , 10 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM EGTA , 100 mM imidazole pH 7 . 0 ) to a 1x final concentration . To maintain ionic strength across all samples , an actin blank was prepared in parallel using G-buffer in place of actin monomers , and used to dilute actin filaments as needed for each sample . Drp1 was diluted to 10 \u03bcM in 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM Imidazole , then centrifuged at 100 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00b0C in a TLA-120 rotor ( Beckman ) . The supernatant was stored on ice , and its protein concentration determined by Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad 500-0006 ) . Drp1 ( 1 . 3 \u03bcM ) was incubated with varying amounts of actin filaments ( 0 . 25\u201310 \u03bcM ) for 1 hr at 23\u00b0C in a 200 \u03bcl volume . The final ionic strength was adjusted to 75 mM using NaCl . Following incubation , samples were centrifuged at 80 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00b0C in a TLA-100 . 1 rotor ( Beckman ) . The supernatant was carefully removed , and 100 \u03bcl was mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer . Pellets were washed briefly and gently with 100 \u03bcl of 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM Imidazole pH 7 . 4 , then resuspended in 100 \u03bcl SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE . Gels were stained with Colloidal blue staining SDS-PAGE ( Invitrogen LC6025 ) , and band intensity was analyzed using ImageJ software . TAMRA-labeled actin ( 1 \u03bcM , 20% TAMRA labeled ) was diluted in TIRF buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 15 mM Glucose , 0 . 5% Methyl Cellulose , 0 . 01 mg/ml catalase ( Sigma C3515 ) , 0 . 05 mg/ml glucose oxidase ( Sigma G6125 ) , 0 . 1% BSA ) was polymerized for 10 min in glass flow chambers ( see below ) , at which point indicated concentrations of GFP-Drp1 ( diluted in TIRF buffer ) was added . The filaments were visualized using an Olympus IX-83 inverted microscope equipped with a 4-channel CellTIRF attachment , appropriate lasers and driven by Metamorph for Olympus software . Simultaneous dual-color images were acquired every 1\u00a0s with TIRF objective ( 60x , 1 . 49 N . A . ) and two Andor Zyla scMOS cameras with an Andor TuCam adapter . Glass flow chambers were assembled using VWR microcover glasses ( 22\u00a0\u00d7 22\u00a0mm and 18\u00a0\u00d7\u00a018\u00a0mm No 1 . 5 ) with double-stick scotch tape to hold 10 \u03bcl volume . Prior to chamber assembly , the cover glasses were washed with acetone ( 50 min ) , ethanol ( 10 min ) , water ( 1 min ) , and incubated in a solution containing a 1:2 ratio of 30% H2O2: concentrated H2SO4 for one hour . Cover glasses were then rinsed with water , 0 . 1 M KOH , and water again . Inert gas was used to completely dry cover glasses before silanization . Glasses were silanized overnight in a solution of 0 . 0025% dichlorodimethyl silane ( Sigma 85126 ) in chloroform , then washed with methanol and dried with inert gas . Glasses were stored in a clean sealed container . Immediately before starting an assay , chambers were incubated with 1% Pluronic F127 ( Sigma P2443 ) in BRB80 buffer ( 80 mM Pipes/KOH , pH 6 . 9 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl2 ) for 1 min , and then equilibrated with TIRF buffer . Drp1 was diluted in 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 . To remove potential aggregates or small Drp1 nuclei , Drp1 was centrifuged at 100 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00b0C in a TLA-120 rotor ( Beckman ) , and the supernatant was stored on ice for use . 4 \u03bcM actin was polymerized for 7 min in G-buffer plus 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 . Drp1 was added to polymerized actin for a final concentration of 1 . 3 \u03bcM Drp1 and 2 \u03bcM actin . Samples ( 30 \u03bcl ) were absorbed onto EM grids ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , CF300-Cu ) for 4 min , then blotted gently with filter paper . Grids were subsequently stained with 1% uranyl acetate solution for 1 min , and again blotted gently with filter paper . The prepared grids were imaged on a JEOL JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope operated at 100\u00a0keV acceleration . Images were collected using an XR-41B AMT digital camera and capture engine software ( AMTV 540; Advanced Microscopy Techniques ) . Filament widths were quantified using ImageJ . To remove ATP , actin monomers in G-buffer were incubated with Bio-Rad AG1-X2 100\u2013200 mesh anion exchange resin ( Dowex ) ( Bio-Rad , 1401241 ) rotating at 4\u00b0C for 5 min , followed by low-speed centrifugation to remove resin . Actin filaments ( 20 \u03bcM ) were polymerized in 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 for 1 hr at 23\u00b0C . Drp1 was diluted in 150 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , then centrifuged to remove aggregates as described above . Drp1 ( 1 . 3 \u03bcM ) was mixed with actin filaments ( 1 \u03bcM ) , and the final ionic strength was adjusted to the equivalent of 75 mM KCl using 4 M KCl stock . Samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 min . At this point , GTP was added to a final concentration of 250 \u03bcM to start reactions at 37\u00b0C . Reactions were quenched at various time points by mixing 20 \u03bcL of sample with 5 \u03bcL of 125 mM EDTA in a clear flat-bottomed 96-well plate ( Greiner ) . Six time points were acquired for each condition . Inorganic phosphate was determined by addition of 150 \u03bcl of malachite green solution ( 1 mM Malachite green ( Sigma Aldrich , 2290105\u2013100\u00a0g ) , 10 mM ammonium molybdate ( [Sigma Aldrich , A7302\u2013100\u00a0g] in 1N HCl ) to 25 \u03bcl quenched reactions . Absorbance at 650 nm was measured with a 96-well fluorescence plate reader ( TECAN Infinite M1000 , Mannedorf , Switzerland ) . GTP hydrolysis rates were determined by plotting phosphate concentration as a function of time . Described in detail in Gurel et al . ( 2014 ) . Briefly , unlabeled and pyrene-labeled actin were mixed to a concentration of 6 . 67 \u03bcM ( 5% pyrene label ) in G-buffer , then diluted to 6 \u03bcM by adding 0 . 1 volumes of 10 mM EGTA/1 mM MgCl2 for 2 min . Polymerization assays were initiated by diluting actin to 2 \u03bcM using 1 . 5x polymerization buffer containing the indicated concentrations of Drp1 . Polymerization was monitored in a TECAN Infinite M1000 fluorescence plate reader at 365 nm excitation and 410 nm emission at 23\u00b0C . Time between reagent mixing and fluorescence recording was < 30 s ."}

The fruit fly known as Drosophila has a fairly simple musculature , which makes it an ideal model animal to investigate how different muscles form . In fruit fly embryos , cells called progenitor cells divide to produce the cells that will go on to form the different muscles . Proteins called identity Transcription Factors are present in progenitor cells . Different combinations of identity Transcription Factors can switch certain genes on or off to control the muscle shapes in specific areas of an embryo . However , progenitor cells born in the same area but at different times display different patterns of identity Transcription Factors; this suggests that timing also influences the orientation , shape and size of a developing muscle , also known as muscle identity . Dubois et al . used a genetic screen to look for identity Transcription Factors and the roles these proteins play in muscle formation in fruit flies . Tracking the activity of these proteins revealed a precise timeline for specifying muscle identity . This timeline involves cascades of different identity Transcription Factors accumulating in the cells , which act to make sure that distinct muscle shapes are made . In flies with specific mutations , the timing of these events is disrupted , which results in muscles forming with different shapes to those seen in normal flies . The findings of Dubois et al . suggest that the timing of when particular progenitor cells form , as well as their location in the embryo , contribute to determine the shapes of muscles . The next step following on from this work is to use video-microscopy to track identity Transcription Factors when the final muscle shapes emerge . Further experiments will investigate how identity Transcription Factors work together with proteins that are directly involved in muscle development .", "source": "Each Drosophila muscle is seeded by one Founder Cell issued from terminal division of a Progenitor Cell ( PC ) . Muscle identity reflects the expression by each PC of a specific combination of identity Transcription Factors ( iTFs ) . Sequential emergence of several PCs at the same position raised the question of how developmental time controlled muscle identity . Here , we identified roles of Anterior Open and ETS domain lacking in controlling PC birth time and Eyes absent , No Ocelli , and Sine oculis in specifying PC identity . The windows of transcription of these and other TFs in wild type and mutant embryos , revealed a cascade of regulation integrating time and space , feed-forward loops and use of alternative transcription start sites . These data provide a dynamic view of the transcriptional control of muscle identity in Drosophila and an extended framework for studying interactions between general myogenic factors and iTFs in evolutionary diversification of muscle shapes . \n The morphological diversity of body wall muscles is necessary for precision , strength and coordination of body movements specific to each animal species . The development of the complex architecture of the body wall musculature of the Drosophila larva \u2013 30 different muscles in each hemi-segment ( Bate , 1993 ) \u2013 is a classical model to decrypt transcription regulatory networks controlling muscle morphological diversity . Each muscle is a single multinucleated fiber built by fusion of a Founder Cell ( FC ) with fusion competent myoblasts ( FCMs ) . Muscle identity - orientation , shape , size , attachment sites - reflects the expression by each FC of a specific combination of identity Transcription Factors ( iTFs ) . Establishment of the FC iTF code starts with activation of specific muscle iTFs , in response to positional information from the ectoderm which defines equivalence groups of myoblasts within each segment , called promuscular clusters ( PMCs ) ( Carmena et al . , 1995; Baylies et al . , 1998 ) . The second step is the selection of progenitor cells ( PCs ) from each PMC , via interplay between Ras signaling and Notch ( N ) /Delta-mediated lateral inhibition , the unselected myoblasts becoming FCMs ( Carmena et al . , 2002 ) . The third step is the asymmetric division of each PC into two FCs or , in some cases , one FC and one adult muscle precursor cell ( AMP ) or pericardial cell . Asymmetric division leads to maintaining expression of some iTFs in one FC and their repression by N signaling in the sibling cell , thereby contributing to muscle lineage diversity ( Ruiz-Gomez et al . , 1997; Carmena et al . , 1998 ) . This henceforth classical , three-step model of muscle identity specification relies heavily on positional information conferring each muscle its identity ( Tixier et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , pioneering studies showed that specification of two nearby Even-skipped ( Eve ) expressing PCs was sequential ( Buff et al . , 1998; Halfon et al . , 2000 ) , but the link between PC birth time and muscle identity remained to be explored . We have previously shown that four PCs , at the origin of one dorsal muscle ( DA2 ) and one AMP , and the 6 dorso-lateral ( DL ) muscles , DA3 , DO3 , DO4 , DO5 , DT1 , and LL1 , are serially selected from a PMC expressing Collier ( Col/Kn , Early B-Cell Factor ( EBF ) in vertebrates ( Daburon et al . , 2008 ) . More precisely , the DA2/AMP , DA3/DO5 and LL1/DO4 PCs are sequentially selected at roughly identical positions in thoracic and abdominal segments , while the DO3/DT1 PC is selected at a slightly posterior position and only in abdominal segments ( Boukhatmi et al . , 2012; Enriquez et al . , 2012; Figure 1A ) . Beyond the PC step , col transcription is only maintained in the DA3 muscle ( Crozatier and Vincent , 1999 ) , while other iTFs , the C2H2 zinc finger protein Kr\u00fcppel ( Kr ) , the homeodomain protein S59 ( vertebrate NKx1 . 1 ) and the Lim-homeodomain protein Tailup ( Tup/Islet1 ) are expressed in the LL1 , DT1 and DA2 lineages , respectively ( Dohrmann et al . , 1990; Ruiz Gomez and Bate , 1997; Boukhatmi et al . , 2012 ) . Serial emergence of DL PCs , followed by lineage-specific expression of different iTFs , raised the question of how PC selection timing and muscle identity were linked . The discovery that Tup expression led to col repression in the DA2/AMP PC , thereby distinguishing between DA2 and DA3 identities , provided a first insight into this question . We indeed found that the time lag between DA2/AMP and DA3/DO5 PC selection coincides with the period of dorsal regression of Tinman ( Tin; vertebrate Nkx2 . 5 ) expression ( Johnson et al . , 2011 ) , such that only the first-born DA2 PC inherits Tin levels above the threshold required for activation of tup and imposing a DA2 fate . Yet , our understanding of how conjunction of developmental time and position translates into muscle-specific iTF codes , remained fragmentary . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14979 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14979 . 005 Here , we identified several new muscle TFs , starting from a systematic deficiency screen of the second chromosome , i . e . , roughly 40% of the Drosophila genome . We describe the roles of No Ocelli ( Noc ) , a NET family zinc finger protein ( Cheah et al . , 1994 ) , Sine oculis ( So ) , a member of the Six family of homeodomain proteins ( Cheyette et al . , 1994; Serikaku and O'Tousa , 1994; Kenyon et al . , 2005 ) , and the co-factor ETS domain lacking Edl ( Baker et al . , 2001; Yamada et al . , 2003; Qiao et al . , 2006 ) in DL muscle development , and in more detail , roles of Eyes-absent ( Eya ) , a partner of Six proteins ( Pignoni et al . , 1997 ) , and Anterior open ( Aop ) , an Ets-domain transcription repressor ( Rebay and Rubin , 1995; Xu et al . , 2000 ) . Analysis of the aop , edl , eya , noc and so muscle mutant phenotypes and time windows of transcription , combined with col transcription in the different mutant contexts , revealed a cascade of regulations including coherent and incoherent feed-forward loops , which link PC selection time to muscle identity . aop and edl control the temporal sequence of DL PC selections , eya is required in PCs for maintaining iTF transcription , while so and one eya-specific isoform are deployed at the FC step . Finally , noc regulates expression of other iTFs , at the PC or FC step , depending upon the muscle lineage . Integration of these new data with pre-existing knowledge provides a comprehensive , dynamic view of the transcriptional control of muscle identity in Drosophila , and an extended framework for studies of interactions between general myogenic factors such as Nautilus ( Nau ) /MyoD and Eya , and iTFs in the diversification of muscle lineages during animal evolution . \n In order to identify new muscle identity genes , we screened a collection of 389 overlapping deficiencies , each deleting between 10 and 15 genes , and together covering about 80% of the Drosophila second chromosome ( Chanut-Delalande et al . , 2014 ) . Homozygous deficiency embryos were first examined for DA3 Col expression at the end of the fusion phase , embryonic stage 15 . Nuclear Col localization allowed appraisal both of DA3 formation and shape , the number and spatial distribution of DA3 nuclei , and the presence of ectopic Col-expressing muscles . General embryonic defects could be identified by the loss , or gross disturbance of Col expression elsewhere , in the central and peripheral nervous systems , and/or lymph gland ( Dubois and Vincent , 2001 ) , and the corresponding chromosomal deficiencies were not considered here . 36 were retained ( Figure 1B and Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . The observed DA3 phenotypes were divided into two broad classes ( Figure 1C ) : Class 1: Decreased number or abnormal repartition of nuclei ( Figure 1E\u2013F compare to Figure 1D ) ; Class 2: Abnormal DA3 orientation and/or either loss of Col expression or ectopic Col expression in additional muscles ( Figure 1G\u2013I compare to Figure 1D ) . Three deletions showing both DA3 abnormal orientation and low nuclei number were considered as class 2 ( regions 3 , 4 and 30 , Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . Class 1 phenotypes have previously been observed in myoblast fusion or nuclei migration mutants which affect roughly equally all muscles ( Folker et al . , 2014; Rushton et al . , 1995 ) and were considered here as 'generic myogenesis' defects ( Figure 1C and Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . Class 2 phenotypes were reminiscent of either iTF or Notch ( N ) mutants ( Ruiz-Gomez et al . , 1997; Crozatier and Vincent , 1999; Tixier et al . , 2010 ) and considered as 'muscle identity' defects ( Figure 1C and Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . To identify the gene ( s ) whose loss caused a DA3 phenotype in mapped deletions , we tested the most promising candidates for which loss of function mutants were available . Genes for which mutants over the deficiency reproduced the deficiency phenotype were selected for further analysis . From a total of 36 different chromosomal regions , we identified 9 genes out of 10 regions linked to generic defects and 15 genes in 14 regions linked to identity defects ( Figure 1J , K and Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . The relevant gene ( s ) in 12 other regions remain to be identified . Seven of the nine genes in the generic class encode cytoskeletal or membrane-associated proteins with an already well-known role in either myoblast fusion or nuclei repartition in muscle syncitia , validating our screen ( Figure 1J; Kim et al . , 2015 ) . The eigth gene is sin3A , a chromatin binding protein present in transcription repressor complexes , also required for a normal pattern of myoblast fusions ( Dobi et al . , 2014 ) . The 9th gene is basigin ( bsg ) , a predicted igG family plasma membrane protein , interacting with integrin ( Curtin et al . , 2005 ) , whose role in muscle development has not been assessed . Among the 15 genes associated with identity phenotypes ( Figure 1K ) , six encoded components of either the N or Robo/Slit signaling pathways , two pathways previously implicated at different steps of DA3 muscle formation ( Crozatier and Vincent , 1999; Ordan et al . , 2015 ) and were therefore not further studied . Four other encoded components of the EGF-R signaling pathway: spitz ( spi ) , Star ( S ) , aop ( also called yan; Flybase FBgn 000097 ) , and edl ( also called mae; Flybase FBgn0023214 ) , while a deficiency ( Df ( 2R ) BSC259 ) removing both mesodermal FGFs , Thisbe and Pyramus , ( Stathopoulos et al . , 2004 ) did not show a DA3 phenotype . A complete lack of DA3 , DO5 , DO4 and LL1 muscles in mutants for either spi ( spiIIA ) , the EGF-R signal , or Star ( SIIN ) , a chaperone protein required for Spi processing ( Heberlein and Rubin , 1991 ) , confirmed the central role of Epidermal Growth Factor-Receptor ( EGF-R ) signaling in specification of these DL muscles ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Seven identity genes encoded transcriptional regulators , and potentially , new muscle iTFs: aop , edl , eya , noc , so , spalt major ( salm ) and tup ( Figures 1K and 2A\u2013F ) . Previous studies showed that the Ets-domain transcription activator Pointed ( Pnt ) , and transcription repressor Aop/Yan ( Xu et al . , 2000; Rebay and Rubin , 1995 ) , promoted and inhibited the formation of Eve-expressing dorsal PCs , respectively , downstream of EGF-R signaling ( Halfon et al . , 2000; Carmena et al . , 2002 ) . The mesodermal function of edl remained , however , unknown . Comparing the aop and edl phenotypes thus provided an opportunity to further characterize outputs of EGF-R signaling in muscle identity specification . Whereas we previously reported tup function in dorsal muscle identity , neither function of noc , salm nor so in muscle development was previously characterized . Drosophila Six4 and So are orthologous to Six proteins which interact with Eya in mouse myogenic progenitors ( Heanue et al . , 1999; Relaix et al . , 2013 ) . eya was proposed to interact with Six4 in Drosophila somatic muscle development , both genes showing similar expression patterns ( Clark et al . , 2006; Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Our identification of so mutants in our screen and the difference between the eya and so phenotypes ( Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) called for a detailed comparison of eya and so expression and function in muscle PCs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14979 . 006Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14979 . 009 To better assess the muscle phenotypes associated with each mutant , we examined the pattern of DL muscles in late stage 15 embryos immunostained for \u03b23Tubulin , using Col staining to visualize DA3 ( Figure 2G\u2013L , Video 1 ) . In addition , we introduced the DA3-specific colLCRM-moeGFP reporter gene ( Enriquez et al . , 2012 ) , to precisely visualize the DA3 contours in these mutant backgrounds . Stability of the MoeGFP fusion protein also allowed following 'DA3' muscles in noc and eya mutants which lack Col expression ( Figure 2M\u2013R ) . In order to verify that muscle phenotypes were not associated with defective tendon cell differentiation , we stained mutant embryos for \u03b2PS integrin which accumulates at muscle-tendon junctions ( Leptin et al . , 1989 ) . Based on this analysis , we eliminated salm ( salm1 ) mutants which exhibited a phenotype reminiscent of defective tendon cells ( Schnorrer and Dickson , 2004; Staudt et al . , 2005; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Unlike salm , no \u03b2PS integrin accumulation defects were detected in null mutants for aop ( aop1 ) , edl ( edlL19 ) , noc ( noc35ba2 ) , eya ( eyaCII-IID ) , and so ( so3 ) mutants ( Figure 2M\u2013R ) , confirming muscle identity defects . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14979 . 010Video 1 . 3-D view of the muscle pattern in stage 16 wt embryos , Figure 2G . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14979 . 010 In aop mutants , the DA3 muscle ( s ) was misshapen in 2/3 of segments ( n\u00a0=\u00a0123 ) , with cases of DA3 to DA2 transformation ( DA3>DA2; Figure 2B , Figure 2\u2014 figure supplement 2 , Video 2 and Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . The DT1 and LL1 muscles were also malformed in 40% segments ( in 48/123 and 47/123 segments , respectively ) and lateral and ventral muscles were severely disorganized . The DA2 muscle was unaffected ( Figure 2H\u2014and Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . colLCRM-moeGFP expression confirmed an abnormal shape of the DA3 muscle suggestive of partial DA3>DA2 transformation ( Figure 2N , T ) . In edl mutants , a second Col-expressing muscle was observed in some segments , sometimes associated with morphological change suggestive of DA2>DA3 transformation ( Figure 2C , I , Figure 2\u2014 figure supplement 2 , Video 3 and Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . The DT1 muscle was either absent or too de-structured to be assigned specific identities ( in 61/124 segments; Figure 2I ) . colLCRM-moeGFP expression confirmed a DA2>DA3 transformation in 47% of segments ( Figure 2O ) , but also revealed a number of reciprocal at least partial DA3>DA2 transformations ( 16/124 segments ) ( Figure 2O inset\u2014and Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . In eya mutants , DA3 Col expression was lost , a loss already observed at the PC stage ( Figure 2D , J ) . Consistent with loss of Col expression early during muscle specification , the DL muscle pattern was severely disorganized in most of segments . The LL1 was absent or oriented like DA3 ( in 129/140 segments; Figure 2J , Figure 2\u2014 figure supplement 2 , Video 4 and Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) a phenotype already observed in col mutant embryos ( Enriquez et al . , 2012 ) . The LT muscles were also often missing and some ventral muscles were absent or malformed , as previously reported ( Figure 2J; Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Conversely , dorsal muscles and DT1 appeared normal ( Figure 2J ) . colLCRM-moeGFP expression revealed a , sometimes complete or partial , DA3>DA2 transformation ( Figure 2P , V ) . noc mutant embryos also lacked DA3 Col expression at stage 15 ( Figure 2E , K and Figure 2 , Figure 2\u2014 figure supplement 2 , Video 5 and Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . Contrary to eya mutants , however , Col expression was detected at the PC stage ( insets in Figure 2E ) , indicating a role of noc in maintenance of Col expression in the DA3 lineage . colLCRM-moeGFP expression further revealed that the DA3 could orient like a DT1 in most segments , indicating a DA3>DT1 identity shift resulting in DT1 duplication ( Figure 2Q and and Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . LT muscles were also affected ( Figure 2K ) . In so mutants , Col ectopic expression was specifically observed in DO5 ( Figure 2F , L , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 , Video 6 , and Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . colLCRM-moeGFP expression both confirmed col ectopic expression in the DO5 muscle and its DA3-like orientation in a fraction of segments ( Figure 2R , arrowhead , indicating a partial DO5>DA3 identity shift in 79/116 segments ( Figure 2F , L and Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14979 . 011Video 2 . 3-D view of the muscle pattern in stage 16 aop1 embryos , Figure 2H .

Understanding the specific muscle transformations observed in aop , edl , eya , noc , and so mutants required determining their expression patterns at the PMC , PC and FC stages . In order to access dynamic aspects of this expression , we used FISH with intronic probes which detect nascent transcripts and allow precisely determining temporal windows of transcription . To follow PC delamination events , we used Nau , the Drosophila ortholog of vertebrate myogenic regulatory factors ( MRFs ) , a marker of PCs and FCs ( Michelson et al . , 1990; Nose et al . , 1998 ) . High-resolution 3-D analyses allow us to unambiguously identify the DA2/AMP and DL PCs and the derived DA2 , DA3 and DO5 FCs and AMP ( Enriquez et al . , 2012; Figure 1A and Figure 3\u2014 figure supplement 1 , Video 7 ) . In early stage 10 embryos , the first selected , DA2/AMP PC is recognizable as a large apical cell , expressing high Nau levels ( Figure 3B , B\u2019 ) . At stage 11 , after the DA2/AMP PC has divided , the DA3/DO5 PC is observed , adjacent to the DA2 FC ( Figure 3C ) . 3-D analyses also revealed previously undescribed , low level Nau expression in two or three cells surrounding each PC being selected ( Figure 3B , F;\u00a0Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . This Nau expression pattern was reminiscent of subgroups of PMCs cells displaying higher level dpMAPK ( di-phospho mitogen-associated protein kinase ) , diagnostic of EGFR activity ( Carmena et al . , 1998 , 2002 ) and postulated to be cells primed to become PCs . Double staining confirmed that the Nau and dpMAPK patterns overlap , revealing that low level Nau expression corresponds to cells transitioning from PMC to PC , before reaching high level in selected PCs ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Using Nau staining allowed us to follow these cells and PCs in subsequent FISH experiments . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14979 . 016Video 7 . Multiple FCs originate from the Col-expressing PMC .

Conversely , edl transcription was not detected in PMC cells , but in PCs and the dorsal AMP and DA3 FC ( Figure 3F\u2013I ) . Thus aop and edl show sequential , complementary transcription patterns . In stage 10 aop mutant embryos , col transcription was detected in PMC cells as in wt ( Figure 3P , S and V ) . However , a significantly increased number of cells expressing low Nau level revealed that aop down-regulation of EGF-R signaling was required to restrict Nau expression to PMC cells primed to become PCs ( Figure 3P , S , V ) . Furthermore , 3-D reconstructions confirmed the presence of two apical cells expressing high Nau Level ( 21/27 PMCs with 2 , and 6/27 with 1 apical PC ) , when only the DA2/AMP PC was observed in wt ( 30/35 PMC with 1 apical PC and 5/35 with no apical PC; Figure 3J , L ) . Thus , concomitant , early selection of two PCs in aop embryos prefigures the DA3>DA2 transformation ( Figure 2T ) . At stage 11 , Nau remained expressed at high level in several cells , showing that supplementary PMC cells are primed to become PCs ( Figure 3M , compare to ) . This corroborates the observation of several aligned DA3-like fibers revealed by phalloidin staining of stage 16 aop mutant embryos ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Conversely , in edl mutant embryos , no high Nau-expressing apical cell was observed at stage 10 ( 30/37 segments ) , when the DA2/AMP PC is selected in wt embryos . Rather , three to four small low Nau-positive cells remained embedded in the Col PMC ( Figure 3N compare with Figure 3J ) ( Figure 3O compare to Figure 3K ) both of which transcribed col ( Figure 3T compare with Figure 3Q ) . Accordingly , col transcription was maintained in two cells at late stage 11 , at positions corresponding to DA2 and DA3 FCs in wt embryos ( Figure 3U compare with Figure 3R ) . In summary , we found that sequential PC selection is inversely compromised in aop and edl mutants . In absence of aop , the DA3/DO5 , and supernumerary PCs are selected early , and in absence of edl , the DA2/AMP is selected too late . We have previously shown that the time lag between DA2/AMP and DA3/DO5 PC selection coincided with a period of dorsal regression of Tin expression , such that only the first selected , DA2/AMP PC inherited Tin ( Boukhatmi et al . , 2012; Figure 4C\u2013D' ) . Tin staining of aop mutant embryos showed that the two apical cells observed at stage 10 inherit Tin ( Figure 4E , E' ) , confirming advanced selection of the DA3/DO5 PC . Conversely , in edl mutants , none of the apical cells inherited Tin , confirming a delayed selection of the DA2/AMP PC ( Figure 4G , H' ) , consistent with both transcribing col ( Figure 3T , U ) . To verify that the observed shifts in PC selection timing lead to shifts of PC identity , we analyzed tup transcription . As previously shown , only the DA2/AMP PC inherits Tin levels above the threshold required for tup activation ( Figure 4I ) , leading in turn to col repression and initiation of tup auto-regulation ( Boukhatmi et al . , 2012 ) . We found that , in aop mutants , early selected PCs transcribed tup ( Figure 4J ) , while in edl mutants , late selected PCs did not ( Figure 4K ) , mirroring col transcription ( Figure 3T , U ) . Together , Tin , tup and col expression data , and the DA3>DA2 and DA2>DA3 muscle transformations predominantly observed in aop and edl embryos , respectively , show that timely PC selection is essential for each PC to inherit different Tin levels and either initiate tup ( DA2/AMP ) or col ( DA3/DO5 ) feed-forward positive loops . Positive auto-regulation , a hallmark of bistable systems ( Graham et al . , 2010; Park et al . , 2012 ) , of either tup or col distinguishes between DA2 and DA3 identities ( Boukhatmi et al . , 2012; Figure 4L ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14979 . 021Figure 4 . aop and edl control the temporal sequence of PC selection .

In edl and aop mutants , the temporal sequence of PC selection is compromised; it occurs too early and too late in aop and edl mutants , respectively , leading to confusions of DA2 and DA3 fates .

FISH performed with a probe complementary to a common coding region , eyae , detected eya expression in the Col PMC , DA2/AMP , DA3/DO5 and LL1/DO4 PCs and DO5 lineage ( Figure 5B\u2013E , O and Figure 5\u2014 figure supplement 2 ) . However , an intronic probe specific for transcripts initiated from the 5\u2019-most TSS ( eya-RBi; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) revealed that eya-RB transcription was restricted to the AMP , DO5 FC/muscle and the LL1/DO4 PC ( Figure 5F\u2013I , P and Figure 5\u2014 figure supplement 2 ) , implying that , conversely , eya-RA/RC is specifically expressed in the PMC , the DA2/AMP and the DA3/DO5 PCs . This indicated a temporal shift in TSS , leading to sequential production of different Eya protein isoforms . In eya mutants , col transcription was detected in PMC cells like in wt ( not shown ) , but prematurely lost in the DA3/DO5 PC , and undetectable in the DA3 FC ( Figure 5R , S ) , showing that eya-RA/RC\u00a0is required for sustained col transcription during PC specification . Reciprocally , both eya-RA/RC transcripts in the DA3/DO5 PC ( de Taffin et al . , 2015 ) and eya-RB transcripts in the DO5 FC ( Figure 5T , U ) were lost in col mutants , revealing that Eya and Col positively regulate each other transcription . Whether , both eya-RA/RC , and eya-RB are under direct control of Col binding to a dedicated cis-regulatory module ( CRM ) ( de Taffin et al . , 2015; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , or eya-RB control is indirect , and requires prior expression of eya-RA/RC at the PC stage ( Figure 5X ) , remains unknown . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14979 . 022Figure 5 .

In most of the remaining muscles , residual Col expression indicates a DA3>DA2 transformation ( arrow in B ) . Col expression is already lost at the PC stage in Six4 mutants ( insets in A , B ) , similar to the loss observed in eya mutants ( See Figure 2D ) .

We found that so was transcribed in the DA2/AMP , DA3/DO5 and LL1/DO4 PCs and subsequently maintained only in the DO5 FC and muscle ( Figure 5J\u2013M , Q and Figure 5\u2014 figure supplement 2 ) . col transcription in DL PCs was normal in so mutants , showing that So is not required for Eya-RA/RC regulation of col transcription ( not shown ) . On the contrary , col was ectopically transcribed in the DO5 FC ( Figure 5V , W ) , showing that so activity contributes to repress col transcription in this lineage . so transcription in the DO5 FC and contribution to distinguishing between the DA3 and DO5 identities suggests that so could act downstream of N in this process ( Crozatier and Vincent , 1999 ) . The difference between the eya and so DA3 mutant phenotypes ( Figure 2D , F , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 , and Videos 4 and 6 ) suggested that eya was partnering with Six4 to positively regulate col . To verify this assertion , we analyzed DA3 Col expression in Six4 mutants . The loss of Col expression ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3 ) , very similar to that observed in eya mutants ( Figure 2D ) , supports the conclusion that Eya partners with Six4 to positively , and with So to negatively regulate col . Thus , Six4 and So play distinct roles during muscle specification ( Figure 5X ) . noc is required for DA3 Col expression and DA3 formation ( Figure 2 ) . noc and its paralog elbow ( elb ) , act as transcription repressors in morphogenesis of appendages , tracheal branches and specification of monochromatic receptors in the retina ( Dorfman et al . , 2002; Nakamura et al . , 2004; Wernet et al . , 2014 ) but a function in myogenesis was not reported . A deficiency removing elb ( Df ( 2R ) exel6035 ) had no DL muscle phenotype , while the phenotypes of noc35ba2 mutants and a deficiency removing both elb and noc were identical ( Figure 1\u2014source data 1 and Figure 2E ) . Thus , only noc is required for DL muscle specification . FISH experiments revealed noc transcription in Col PMC cells which express low Nau level , followed by the DA2/AMP , the DA3/DO5 and the LL1/DO4 , but not the DT1/DO3 PC ( Figure 6B\u2013E ) . In noc mutants , col transcription was detected in the PMC and DA3/DO5 PC ( not shown ) but completely lost from the DA3 FC ( Figure 6F , G ) , correlating with the loss of Col DA3 expression after the PC stage ( Figure 2E , K ) . The DA3>DT1 transformation observed at stage 15 in noc mutants ( Figure 2Q ) was therefore intriguing , since a DA3>DA2 identity shift was observed in other mutants where DA3 Col expression was lost , namely col , eya and Six4 ( Figure 2D and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Since DT1 identity requires S59 expression in the DT1 FC ( Knirr et al . , 1999 ) , we analyzed S59 expression in noc mutant embryos and found that it was ectopically expressed in the DA3 FC ( Figure 6H , I ) , consistent with DA3>DT1 transformation . This finding suggested that loss of DA3 Col expression in noc embryos was secondary to gain of S59 expression . To test this possibility , we expressed S59 in all myoblasts , using the Twist-Gal4 pan-mesodermal driver . While the muscle pattern was severely disorganized , loss of Col expression in Twi>S59 embryos demonstrated S59 ability to repress col mesodermal expression ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . We next analyzed col transcription in S59 mutants and found that it was ectopically transcribed in one posterior DL FC , likely DT1 ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C , D ) . On the one hand , these data confirmed that S59 represses col transcription in the DT1 lineage , via an incoherent feed-forward loop initiated by Col activation of S59 in the DT1/DO3 PC ( Enriquez et al . , 2012 ) . On the other hand , noc and S59 loss-of-function and S59 gain-of-function data revealed a double negative regulatory cascade where noc repression of S59 maintains col transcription in the DA3 lineage and DA3 identity ( Figure 6J ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14979 . 029 Analysis of the DL muscle phenotypes showed that formation of the LL1 muscle is also affected in noc , aop and eya mutants ( Figure 2K , W and Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . Kr was previously shown to be expressed in the LL1 PC and required for LL1 development ( Ruiz-Gomez et al . , 1997 ) . We found that Kr expression in the LL1/DO4 ( but not DA1 ) PC required both noc and eya activity , but neither aop nor col ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) ( Enriquez et al . , 2012 ) . These data further underline the intricate wiring and combinatorial nature of transcriptional regulations specifying muscle identities ( Figure 7 ) . \n Noc and Elb are two transcription repressors belonging to the NET family of C2H2 zinc finger proteins ( Dorfman et al . , 2002; Nakamura et al . , 2004 ) . Until now , identification of a Tin-dependent mesodermal noc enhancer was the only suggestion of a possible function in muscle development ( Jin et al . , 2013 ) . We show here that noc is required for distinguishing between DA3 and DT1 muscle identities . Primary transcript analyses revealed that noc maintenance of col transcription in the DA3 lineage involved a double Noc \u2014|S59 \u2014|col negative loop . Col activation of S59 expression ( Enriquez et al . , 2012 ) initiates a negative , 'incoherent' feed-forward loop in the DT1/DO3 PC , resulting in Col repression and DT1 identity . Noc breaks this loop in the DA3 lineage ( Figure 7 ) . noc is transcribed in myoblasts expressing low Nau level whose number is controlled by EGF-R signaling , and selected PCs ( Figure 6 and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . However , it is not transcribed in the DT1/DO3 PC which is specified under control of abdominal Hox proteins ( Enriquez et al . , 2010 ) . Thus noc regulation integrates multimodal signaling and positional inputs . Functions of vertebrate NET proteins Nolz-1/Nolz2 and ZNF503/nlz1 have , so far , been addressed in the central nervous system . Yet , zebrafish Znf503 and mouse nolz1 are expressed in branchial arches ( zfin ID: ZDB-Gene-031113-5 , genebank accession number NM-198840; Chang et al . , 2013 ) . Whether this expression corresponds to migrating myoblasts which contribute to facial muscle development and express orthologs of other iTFs studied here ( Nathan et al . , 2008; Sambasivan et al . , 2009; Tolkin and Christiaen , 2012; Razy-Krajka et al . , 2014; Diogo et al . , 2015 ) , remains to be explored . Our previous finding that several PCs are sequentially selected from the Col PMC and each express a specific iTF code brought to light the importance of time in muscle identity specification ( Boukhatmi et al . , 2012 ) . We report here that aop and edl , are required for the robustness of sequential selection of the DA2/AMP and DA3/DO5 PCs . A consequence of lack of Aop function is the premature , concomitant selection of several Nau-expressing PCs , when sequential in wt embryos . These data indicate that Aop acts to restrict EGF-R MAPK activity to prospective PCs , as previously suggested ( Carmena et al . , 2002 ) . Inversely , edl expression in selected cells and delayed PC delamination in edl mutant embryos indicate that Edl ensures timely progression of primed cells to a stable PC fate . Thus , proper regulation of EGF-R signaling effectors is both required for the proper number and temporal sequence of PC selections . During eye development , the differentiation of all ommatidial cell types is triggered in a stereotypical sequence by reiterated EGFR use ( Freeman , 1996 ) . Likewise , EGF-R signalling regulates pulses of cell delamination from the ectoderm ( Brodu et al . , 2004 ) . Whether pulses of EGF-R signalling control serial PC selection remains to be determined . Parallels between serial PC selection and successive waves of neuroblast ( NB ) selection ( Doe , 1992; Berger et al . , 2001 ) are striking . However , in NB lineages , the focus of investigation has shifted to the sequential expression of Temporal Transcription Factors ( TTFs ) in each NB progeny , which specifies the temporal identity of neurons ( Isshiki et al . , 2001 ) , and\u00a0how birth time controls NB identity has not been determined . Our observation of an increased number of Nau-positive cells in aop mutants revealed that Nau/MyoD is expressed in myoblasts primed to a PC fate . Nau role in generic myogenesis versus identity aspects has been debated ( Balagopalan et al . , 2001; Wei et al . , 2007 ) . We have previously proposed that Nau iTF functions could reflect lineage-dependent cooperation with other iTFs ( Enriquez et al . , 2012 ) . Another b-HLH protein , Lethal of Scute ( L ( 1 ) sc ) , has been proposed to act as a promuscular gene ( Carmena et al . , 1995 ) , based on its pattern of expression and regulation in PMCs and PCs , and by analogy to the role of proneural b-HLH proteins in NB selection . Yet , only minor muscle patterning defects were observed in l ( 1 ) sc mutants ( Carmena et al . , 1995 ) . The detection of Nau expression in PMC cells subject to high EGF-R signaling raises the possibility that Nau could play earlier functions than previously thought in the PC specification process . The time lag between DA2/AMP and DA3/DO5 PC emergence coincides with dorsal regression of Tin expression , due to an auto-regulatory circuit in which Tin progressively limits its own transcription ( Johnson et al . , 2011 ) . We previously showed that only the DA2/AMP PC inherited Tin ( Boukhatmi et al . , 2012 ) . Considering Tin levels as a translation of developmental time , our new results show that EGF-R control of serial PC selection converts this translation into sharp transcriptional decisions and ultimately distinct muscle identities ( Figures 4 and 7 ) . Tup and Col direct up-regulation of their own transcription after the PC stage ( Enriquez et al . , 2010; Boukhatmi et al . , 2012 , 2014 ) can explain why small differences in initial expression levels are transformed into stable muscle fates . Our data thus provide a new paradigm for how birth timing controls cell identity during development ( Figure 4L ) . Drosophila Six proteins , Six4 , So and Op correspond to vertebrate Six1/2 , Six4/5 and Six3/6 , respectively ( Kenyon et al . , 2005 ) . Six1/2/4/5 proteins have been reported to interact with eya in controlling the myogenic progenitor cell population in mouse , while no role was found for Six3/6 in this process ( Relaix et al . , 2013 ) . Likewise , we did not observe DL muscle pattern defects in embryos lacking op ( Df ( 2R ) Exel6055 ) . Drosophila Six4 was previously proposed to interact with Eya in regulating somatic muscle development , both genes showing similar expression pattern ( Clark et al . , 2006; Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Tin in vivo binding to the so locus ( Liu et al . , 2009; Jin et al . , 2013 ) raised the possibility that so could also be involved in muscle development . Interestingly , temporal ChIP profiles indicated Tin binding to six4 earlier than to so ( Jin et al . , 2013 ) , suggesting sequential regulation . Our data show that one eya isoform , eya-RB , is transcribed later than the other isoforms ( eya-RA/RC , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , owing to a switch in TSS , correlating with the profile of\u00a0in vivo RNA polymerase II binding ( Bonn et al . , 2012 ) . Together , these expression data and our finding that eya and Six4 regulate positively , and so negatively , col transcription , suggest that Eya could switch from activator to repressor , by changing partner , from Six4 to So . We thus hypothesize that sequential partnering of different Eya isoforms and Six proteins could contribute the diversity of iTF codes and muscle morphologies ( Figure 7 ) . Various contributions of mouse Six1/2/4 to the Pax3/MyoD transcription regulatory network controlling early myogenesis in different embryonic territories have recently been reported ( Relaix et al . , 2013 ) . It would be interesting to determine whether different eya isoforms are also involved in different Six partnerships and control different facets of muscle development in vertebrates . Characterisation of aop , edl , eya , noc and so functions and transcription dynamics revealed that distinguishing between DA3 , versus DA2 , DT1 or DO5 identities involves specific sequences of transcriptional regulations integrating temporal and positional cues ( Figure 7 ) . The functions of these , and previously characterized iTFs , underline the intricacy of positive and negative regulatory loops acting at successive steps in different muscle lineages ( Figure 7 ) . Besides clear transformations suggestive of complete identity switch , a significant fraction of muscles show incomplete transformations in iTF mutant embryos . This supports the idea that , rather than lineage-specific 'master iTFs' , stereotypy of Drosophila muscle patterns relies upon combinatorial inputs of multiple iTFs during PC and FC specification . The finding that TFs combinatorically specify muscle identity ( Enriquez et al . , 2012; de Joussineau et al . , 2012; Boukhatmi et al . , 2014 , this report ) indicates that activation of their target genes is context-dependent and involves multiple cis-regulatory elements . Multiple levels of cross-regulation ( Figure 7 ) could provide robustness to the final muscle pattern . While a function of Nolz proteins in the mesoderm remains to be investigated , Nkx2 . 5 , Eya , Six1 , Islet1 , Col/Ebf and MyoD , are core components of transcriptional regulatory networks controlling the development of pharyngeal/facial muscles originating from the cardio-pharyngeal territory in chordates . Our data raise the possibility that these conserved mesodermal TFs could combinatorically control muscle regional diversity in vertebrates , attested by human muscular dystrophies ( Emery , 2002 ) . but whose molecular basis remains poorly understood . It is reasonable to speculate that these TFs have been co-opted in different wirings during evolution to generate the muscle lineage diversity found in the animal kingdom . \n Deficiency lines from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center were balanced over a CyO\u2013wg\u2013LacZ chromosome to genotype embryos ( Chanut-Delalande et al . , 2014 ) . Screening for embryonic phenotypes was as in Chanut-Delalande et al . ( 2014 ) , except that embryos were stained with a monoclonal mouse antibody against the Col protein ( Dubois et al . , 2007 ) . Genetic complementation assays were used to identify genes in chromosomal deficiencies whose loss led to DA3 phenotype . Homozygous aop1 , edlL19 , eyaCII/IID , so3 , noc35ba2 , salm1 , and col1\u00a0homozygous mutants showed muscle phenotypes identical to trans-heterozygous mutants over deficiency . They were thus considered as null alleles and consistently used for phenotypic analyses . For eya analysis , we used eyaCII/IID/Df ( 2l ) BSC354 trans-heterozygous embryos as eyaCII/IID homozygous embryos present a strong myoblast fusion defect ( not shown ) , not observed in transheterozygous and probably due to a secondary mutations on the eyaCII/IID chromosome . Col::moeGFP expression under control of a late mesodermal col CRM ( colLCRM; previously named 2 . 6_0 . 9c; Dubois et al . , 2007 ) was used to visualize the DA3 muscle contours in mutant embryos . The col PMC cells and PCs were visualized in col mutant embryos by LacZ expression under control of the early mesodermal col CRM , colECRM ( previously CRM276; Enriquez et al . , 2010 ) . For all deficiency screening , sample size was estimated empirically ( >100 stage 14\u201316 embryos , in duplicates ) . For aop , edl , eya , so , and noc , mutant analyses , sample sizes are indicated in the text and the legend of Figure 2\u2014source data 1 . Antibody staining and in situ hybridization with intronic probes were as described previously ( Dubois et al . , 2007 ) . Primary antibodies were: mouse \u03b2PS integrin , anti-Col ( Dubois et al . , 2007 ) , anti-GFP ( Torrey Pines Biolabs ) , anti-\u03b2-galactosidase ( Promega , Madison , Wisconsin ) , rabbit anti-Tin ( Manfred Frasch , Erlangen , Germany ) , anti-Nau ( Bruce Paterson , Bethesda , USA ) , anti-Kr ( Ralf Pflanz , Goettingen , Germany ) , anti-\u03b23-tubulin ( Renate Renkawitz-Pohl , Marburg , Germany ) . Secondary antibodies were: Alexa Fluor 488- and 555-conjugated antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) , and biotinylated goat anti-mouse ( Vector Laboratories ) . Digoxygenin-labelled antisense RNA probes were transcribed in vitro from PCR-amplified DNA sequences , using T7 polymerase ( Roche Digoxigenin labelling Kit ) . For aop , edl and eya-RB , 3 non overlapping 600 nucleotide ( nt ) probes were pooled together; for noc , a single probe spanning the entire 302 bp intron; for so , a 2771nt probe hydrolyzed to ~600nt fragments ( Cox et al . , 1984 ) . The primer pairs used to amplify the different intron fragments are listed below , with the T7 promoter indicated by small characters . aop1: CTCATTGTATGCACGGTACG aop1T7: ccgaattctaatacgactcactatagggATAGCTGCGGCAGAAGCAGG aop2: GCAACAGCAACACTCCAATC aop2T7: ccgaattctaatacgactcactatagggAGACGGTGCGGGCAGAAATTGGG aop3: AAGAGAAAGAGCACGGCAAG aop3T7: ccgaattctaatacgactcactatagggAGATCGGCGACGTTCTCCGAGAC edl1: GGGAGGTGGAAATGACAAAC edl1T7: ccgaattctaatacgactcactatagggCATCGTCTGCCTGACGTCTG edl2: CCAAATATCGCCGATAAGCC edl2T7: ccgaattctaatacgactcactatagggAGACTGCGCACAGGATGCACACC edl3: GAAGATCGACCAGACTTAGG edl3T7: ccgaattctaatacgactcactatagggAGAAGCGGCGTCGAGATTCCCAG eyaRB1: GTTCCTCTAGCTCCGAAATG eyaRB1T7: ccgaattctaatacgactcactatagggTTACGCCGGAGTTGTGAGGG eyaRB2: GACAGCATCGGAGACAACAC eyaRB2T7: ccgaattctaatacgactcactatagggCCCGGCCACAAACGAGAAAC eyaRB3: AGCCCAGTCAAATGCGAAAC eyaRB3T7: ccgaattctaatacgactcactatagggATGCGTGTCCGTGTCGCTAC noc1: CGACGGTTAGTATTGACTAAG noc1T7: ccgaattctaatacgactcactatagggGGCGTCCATCTGTTATGAATAAAATG so1: TCCACGTTTCCAAGTTGGCTACTC so1T7: ccgaattctaatacgactcactatagggAATGCGGCATGTTCGATGCTCGATAATCGG Confocal sections were acquired on Leica SP5 or SPE microscopes at 40\u00d7 magnification , 1024/1024 pixel resolution .

The first symptom is difficulty hearing high-pitched sounds like children\u2019s voices . The disease starts gradually and worsens over time . Changes in the ear , the nerve that connects it to the brain , or the brain itself can cause hearing loss . Sometimes all three play a role . Genetics , exposure to noise , disease , and aging may all contribute . The condition is so complex it is difficult for scientists to pinpoint a primary suspect or develop treatments . Now , Guarch , Font-Llitjo\u0301s et al . show that errors in a protein called SLC7A8 cause age-related hearing loss in mice and humans . The SLC7A8 protein acts like a door that allows amino acids \u2013 the building blocks of proteins \u2013 to enter or leave a cell . This door is blocked in mice lacking SLC7A8 and damage occurs in the part of their inner ear responsible for hearing . As a result , the animals lose their hearing . Next , Guarch , Font-Llitjo\u0301s et al . scanned the genomes of 147 people from isolated villages in Italy for mutations in the gene for SLC7A8 . The people also underwent hearing tests . Mutations in the gene for SLC7A8 that partially block the door and prevent the flow of amino acids were found in people with hearing loss . Some mutations in SLC7A8 that allow the door to stay open where found in people who could hear . The experiments suggest that certain mutations in the gene for SLC7A8 are likely an inherited cause of age-related hearing loss . It is possible that other proteins that control the flow of amino acids into or out of cells also may play a role in hearing . More studies are needed to see if it is possible to fix errors in the SLC7A8 protein to delay or restore the hearing loss .", "source": "Age-related hearing loss ( ARHL ) is the most common sensory deficit in the elderly . The disease has a multifactorial etiology with both environmental and genetic factors involved being largely unknown . SLC7A8/SLC3A2 heterodimer is a neutral amino acid exchanger . Here , we demonstrated that SLC7A8 is expressed in the mouse inner ear and that its ablation resulted in ARHL , due to the damage of different cochlear structures . These findings make SLC7A8 transporter a strong candidate for ARHL in humans . Thus , a screening of a cohort of ARHL patients and controls was carried out revealing several variants in SLC7A8 , whose role was further investigated by in vitro functional studies . Significant decreases in SLC7A8 transport activity was detected for patient\u2019s variants ( p . Val302Ile , p . Arg418His , p . Thr402Met and p . Val460Glu ) further supporting a causative role for SLC7A8 in ARHL . Moreover , our preliminary data suggest that a relevant proportion of ARHL cases could be explained by SLC7A8 mutations . \n Age-related hearing loss ( ARHL ) or presbycusis is one of the most prevalent chronic medical conditions associated with aging . Indeed , more than 30% of people aged over 65 years suffer ARHL ( Gates and Mills , 2005; Huang and Tang , 2010; Van Eyken et al . , 2007 ) . Clinically , ARHL is defined as a progressive bilateral sensorineural impairment of hearing in high sound frequencies mainly caused by a mixture of 3 pathological changes: loss of the hair cells of the organ of Corti ( sensory ) , atrophy of the stria vascularis ( metabolic ) and degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons ( SGN ) , as well as the central auditory pathway ( neural ) ( Gates and Mills , 2005; Schuknecht , 1955; Yamasoba et al . , 2013 ) . ARHL has a complex multifactorial etiology with both genetic and environmental factors contributing ( Cruickshanks et al . , 2010; Christensen et al . , 2001 ) . Although most people lose hearing acuity with age , it has been demonstrated that genetic heritability affects the susceptibility , onset and severity of ARHL ( Wingfield et al . , 2007; Cruickshanks et al . , 2001; Gates et al . , 1999; Karlsson et al . , 1997; Cruickshanks et al . , 1998 ) . Unfortunately , the complexity of the pathology coupled with highly variable nature of the environmental factors , which cause cumulative effects , increases the difficulty in identifying the genetic contributors underlying ARHL . Most of the findings from genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) performed into adult hearing function could neither be replicated between populations , nor the functional validation of those candidates be confirmed ( Dawes and Payton , 2016 ) . Mouse models , including inbred strains , have been essential for the identification of several defined loci that contribute to ARHL ( Bowl and Dawson , 2015 ) . SLC7A8/SLC3A2 is a Na+\u2010independent transporter of neutral amino acids that corresponds to system L also known as LAT2 ( L-type Amino acid Transporter-2 ) ( Pineda et al . , 1999; Rossier et al . , 1999; Oxender and Christensen , 1963 ) . SLC7A8 is the catalytic subunit of the heterodimer and mediates obligatory exchange with 1:1 stoichiometry of all neutral amino acids , including the small ones ( e . g . alanine , glycine , cysteine and serine ) , which are poor substrates for SLC7A5 ( 18 ) , another exchanger with system L activity . Functional data indicate that the role of SLC7A8 is to equilibrate the relative concentrations of different amino acids across the plasma membrane instead of mediating their net uptake ( Pineda et al . , 1999; Meier et al . , 2002; Verrey , 2003 ) . The SLC7A8/SLC3A2 heterodimer is primarily expressed in renal proximal tubule , small intestine , blood-brain barrier and placenta , where it is thought to have a role in the flux of amino acids across cell barriers ( Rossier et al . , 1999; Bauch et al . , 2003; Kanai and Endou , 2001; del Amo et al . , 2008 ) . So far , SLC7A8 research has been focused mainly on amino acid renal reabsorption . However , in vitro studies demonstrated that SLC7A8 could have a role in cystine efflux in epithelial cells and the in vivo deletion of Slc7a8 in a mouse model showed a moderate neutral aminoaciduria ( Braun et al . , 2011 ) , suggesting compensation by other neutral amino acid transporters . Therefore , in order to better understand the physiology of SLC7A8 , we generated null Slc7a8 knockout mice ( Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 ) ( Font-LLitj\u00f3s , 2009 ) and ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Here , we describe the detection of a hypoacusic phenotype in the Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mouse model and demonstrate that novel loss-of-function SLC7A8 mutations constitute a primary cause in the development of ARHL in a cohort of elderly people from two isolated villages in Italy . \n SLC7A8 is highly expressed in the kidney , intestine and brain , and neither full-length nor truncated SLC7A8 protein were detected in membrane samples of Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 1A ) . The Allen Brain Atlas ( Allen Institute for Brain Science , 2004 ) localizes mouse brain SLC7A8 to the cortical subplate , cerebellum , thalamus and olfactory bulb . Our results showed that SLC7A8 protein was localized to the plasma membrane of neuronal axons in different brain regions such as , the choroid plexus , subfornical organ , cerebral cortex and hypothalamus by immunohistochemistry ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . This specific localization in the brain pointed to the possibility that the absence of the transporter could potentially lead to neurological disorders . Behavioral screening showed that absence of SLC7A8 in mice does not affect either learning or memory ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . In contrast , a significant reduction in latency was observed in the rotarod acceleration test indicating impairment in motor coordination in Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3G ) . Reaffirming poorer motor coordination performance in the Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice , an increased exposure to shock on the treadmill was also observed ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B ) . Interestingly , a marked impairment was observed in the pre-pulse inhibition of acoustic startle response , which assesses the response to a high intensity acoustic stimulus ( pulse ) and its inhibition by a weaker pre-pulse . The response to a 120 dB single-pulse was significantly reduced in Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 1B ) . The higher threshold required for responding to the acoustic stimulus in the PPI tests in Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 animals could potentially be indicative of a hearing impairment or to a defect in the stress response signaling . Response to stress is modulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis via the release of corticosterone from the adrenal cortex ( Smith and Vale , 2006 ) . As SLC7A8 is expressed in the murine pituitary gland ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A and S3H ) , plasma corticosterone levels under stressing conditions were analyzed . No differences were observed in corticosterone levels at either basal conditions , nor under restraint stress in the Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 group , indicating a normal stress response in the absence of SLC7A8 ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3I ) . Thus , a hearing impairment in Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 animals was considered the most probable cause of the differences observed in the acoustic startle response test ( Figure 1B ) . The impact of the ablation of SLC7A8 on the auditory system was tested initially on mice with a mixed C57BL6/J\u2010129Sv genetic background . Auditory brainstem response ( ABR ) recording , which evaluates the functional integrity of the auditory system , was performed in Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice . Reinforcing our hypothesis , adult 4- to 6-month-old Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice showed significantly higher ( p\u22640 . 01 ) ABR thresholds in response to click stimulus , compared with age matched Slc7a8+/\u2212 and wild type mice , which maintain normal hearing thresholds ( Figure 1C\u2013E ) . The hearing loss observed in Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice affected the highest frequencies tested ( 20 , 28 and 40 kHz ) ( Figure 1F ) . The analysis of latencies and amplitudes of the ABR waves in response to click stimuli , showed increased latency and decreased amplitude of wave I , but similar II-IV interpeak latency , in the Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice when compared with the other genotypes , pointing to a hypoacusis of peripheral origin without affectation of the central auditory pathway ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A to D ) . Mice were grouped according to genotype , age and ABR threshold level and descriptive statistics calculated , showing that the penetrance of the hearing phenotype in the Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice is incomplete ( Figure 1D and E ) . Therefore , mice were classified according to their hearing loss ( HL ) phenotype , defining normal hearing when ABR thresholds for all frequencies were\u00a0<45 dB SPL , mild phenotype when at least two thresholds were between 45\u00a0and\u00a060 dB SPL and severe hypoacusis when at least two thresholds were\u00a0>60 dB SPL . At 4\u20136 months of age , Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice showed either severe ( 37 . 5% ) or mild ( 25% ) hearing loss , whilst mice from the other genotypic groups did not show hearing loss ( Figure 1E ) . Next we studied 7\u201313 month-old mice , 50% of Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice presented severe hypoacusis and the hearing loss spread to lower frequencies with age . Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice with hearing loss showed statistically significant differences in ABR parameters when compared to the other genotypes ( Figure 1F ) . Moreover , 43% of Slc7a8+/\u2212 mice developed mild hearing loss at 7\u201313 months , whereas the age-matched wild-type mice maintained intact hearing indicating a predisposition toward hearing loss in aged Slc7a8+/\u2212mice ( Figure 1E ) . The onset and severity of ARHL is attributed to both environmental and genetic factors ( Cruickshanks et al . , 2010 ) . As the environmental factors were well controlled in all the experiments , thus the phenotypic variability could be attributed as the consequence of individual genetic differences . Indeed , it has been described that several strains of inbred mice present a predisposition to suffer ARHL dependent on multiple genetic factors ( Kane et al . , 2012; Murillo-Cuesta et al . , 2010 ) . Here , the hearing loss phenotype was confirmed in a second mouse strain , the inbread C57BL6/J genetic background ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5 ) . Additionally , longitudinal study of Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice into the inbred C57BL6/J genetic background showed higher penetrance than the mixed background throughout the ages studied ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The presence of SLC7A8 has previously been reported in the mouse cochlea ( Yang et al . , 2011; Uetsuka et al . , 2015; Sharlin et al . , 2011 ) , and specifically localized to the stria vascularis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrophotometry and by Western blotting ( Uetsuka et al . , 2015 ) . Here , SLC7A8 was detected in wild-type mouse cochlea by immunofluorescence supporting its localization to the spiral ligament and spiral limbus from the basal to the apical regions of the cochlea ( Figure 2A and B ) . SLC7A8 immunolabeling was not observed in the stria vascularis . We observed an intense expression of SLC7A8 in the spiral ligament surrounding the stria indicating that the SLC7A8 epitope ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) is either hidden or absent in the stria vascularis . Quantification of SLC7A8 expression in the cochlea showed half a dose of the transporter in the Slc7a8+/\u2212than in wild-type mice , and its ablation in Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 2C ) . A closer study of SLC7A8 immunofluorescence showed that the transporter is also expressed in the spiral ganglia neurons area ( SGN ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . The early HL onset and the progressive ARHL phenotype observed in Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 and Slc7a8+/\u2212 mice respectively , prompted us to compare the expression of SLC7A8 in wild-type cochlea at different ages ( Figure 1D ) . Immunofluorescence quantification of SLC7A8 intensity at 2- and 12 months of age showed expression in the young mice and increased presence of the transporter in the older mice ( Figure 2D ) . In the same line , Slc7a8 mRNA quantification from cochlea extracts showed a progressive increased expression throughout mouse life ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . The cytoarchitecture of the inner ear was studied by hematoxylin/eosin staining ( Figure 3 ) , immunofluorescence ( Figure 4\u00a0and\u00a0Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) and mRNA detection of several cochlear markers ( Figure 3D and\u00a0Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Most of the structures of the cochlear duct , including spiral ligament , spiral limbus , tectorial and basilar membranes showed a normal gross cytoarchitecture in the Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice . In contrast , in the basal turns of the cochlea we observed that 3 out of 6 Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice evaluated showed complete loss of hair cells and flat epithelia , while only one Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mouse showed intact epithelia in the organ of Corti ( Figure 3A ) . Likewise , loss of cells in the spiral ganglia , especially in the basal regions of the cochlea , was observed ( Figure 3A ) . Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice at 4 to 7 months of age presented\u00a0~50% of cell loss in the spiral ganglion compared with wild type mice ( Figure 3B ) . Decreased number of cells in the ganglia significantly correlates with ABR threshold and HL phenotype ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1and B ) . Concomitantly with the loss of hair cells and spiral ganglion ( SG ) nuclei in Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 mice , the messenger levels of cell type specific biomarkers , such as the potassium voltage-gated channels Kcnq2 , Kcnq3 and Kcnq5 , and the transporter Slc26a5 , which are expressed in the organ of Corti and SG were down-regulated respectively ( Figure 3D and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . Less densely packed cells in the spiral ligament were observed in Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 than in wild-type mice ( Figure 3A ) . Reinforcing this observation , the expression of Kir4 . 1 , a potassium channel highly expressed in stria vascularis cells ( Ando and Takeuchi , 1999 ) , was also dramatically reduced by 50% in Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 ( Figure 4B and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Likewise , decreased expression of Kir4 . 1 marker correlates with HL phenotype ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Phalloidin labeling of actin fibers in the basal cells of the stria vascularis was also decreased 50% in the base of the cochlea ( Figure 4C and\u00a0Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . SLC7A8 is abundantly expressed in fibrocytes of the spiral ligament and limbus ( Figure 2 ) , accordingly the number of fibrocytes in the spiral ligament decreased by 2/3 and 1/3 in the null and Slc7a8+/\u2212 mice , respectively ( Figure 3C ) . Moreover , mice with severe HL phenotype showed 30% less number of fibrocytes in the spiral ligament ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . The expression of the transcription factor Tbx18 , essential for fibrocytes development and differentiation , was 50% less in Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 than in wild-type mouse cochleae ( Figure 3D ) . In contrast , the expression of s100 , fibrocyte types I and II marker , did not show significant differences ( Figure 4D and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Once we associated mouse SLC7A8 transporter with deafness and identified it as a potential ARHL gene , screening for mutations in human populations was initiated . Whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) and audiogram test data obtained from 147 individuals from isolated villages in Italy were included in the study . The inclusion criteria were people 50 years old or older with an audiogram test done at high frequencies ( Pure-tone audiometric PTA-H , 4 and 8 kHz ) . Individuals with pure-tone average for high frequencies ( PTA-H ) greater than or equal to 40 decibels hearing level ( dB HL ) were considered ARHL cases , whilst people with PTA-H less than 25 dB were considered as controls . A total of 66 cases suffering ARHL and 81 controls were selected . The gene-targeted studies conducted in this isolated cohort succeeded in detecting seven heterozygous missense variants ( Table 1 ) . Four of the variants: p . Val460Glu ( V460E ) , p . Thr402Met ( T402M ) , p . Val302Ile ( V302I ) and p . Arg418His ( R418C ) belong to ARHL cases ( see Audiogram in Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) and other three: p . Arg8Pro ( R8P ) , p . Ala94Thr ( A94T ) and p . Arg185Gln ( R185L ) to the control group ( see Audiogram in Audiogram in Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . All the mutations found in SLC7A8 cases and controls from isolated villages of Friuli Venezia Giulia exhibited different frequencies in comparison to public data bases , such as ExAC among others ( see Table 1 ) . According to ExAC database\u2019s constrain metrics ( Lek et al . , 2016 ) , the gene shows evidence of tolerance of both loss of function ( pLi\u00a0=\u00a00 ) and missense variation ( missense Z score\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120 . 14 ) . A structural model of human SLC7A8 protein built using the homologous protein AdiC ( Kowalczyk et al . , 2011 ) in the outward-facing conformation ( Rosell et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C and D ) was used to localize all the mutations identified here . Interestingly , three of the four mutations found in ARHL patients were located in very striking places: ( i ) V302 is a conserved amino acid located in the extracellular loop four which corresponds to the external lid that closes the substrate binding site when the transporter is open to the cytosol , ( ii ) T402 is located in transmembrane ( TM ) domain 10 facing to the substrate binding site , and ( iii ) V460 is located at the very end of TM domain 12 , with potential interaction with the plasma membrane . In contrast , R418 is in the intracellular loop 5 , between TM domain 10 and TM domain 11 and with no functional role described in transporters with the LeuT-fold ( Krishnamurthy and Gouaux , 2012 ) . Thus , three of these mutations were promising candidates to affect the transporter function due to their crucial location . In vitro functional characterization of variants present in patients with ARHL and controls was performed by measuring amino acid uptake in HeLa cells co-transfected with the heavy subunit CD98hc and Strep tagged-SLC7A8 wild type and variants ( Figure 5 ) . Co-expression of the light ( SLC7A8 ) and the heavy ( CD98hc ) subunits in the same cell increases the plasma membrane localization of the transporter ( Rosell et al . , 2014 ) . All tested variants showed expression levels comparable to those of wild type , except for V460E that showed only 20% expression of wild -ype protein ( Figure 5\u2014source data 1 ) , being the only variant that did not reach the plasma membrane as indicated by the lack of co-localization with wheat germ agglutinin staining ( Figure 5A ) . Amino acid transport induced by SLC7A8 was analyzed for wild type and the identified variants ( Figure 5B ) . All variants present in controls ( R8P , R186L and A94T ) conserved more than 80% of alanine transport compared with wild-type protein . Three variants found in patients with ARHL showed diminished alanine transport activity: T402M and V460E presented little residual transport activity ( 14 . 6 \u00b1 2 . 6% and 3 . 6 \u00b1 0 . 3% of wild-type activity , respectively ) and R418C showed 50 . 7 \u00b1 5 . 4% of wild-type alanine transport . Surprisingly , V302I presented similar alanine transport levels to wild type SLC7A8 . Location of residue V302 within EL4 ( within the external substrate lid ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D ) led us to additionally measure a larger size SLC7A8 substrate , whose transport could potentially be more compromised than that of a small substrate ( e . g . alanine ) . Interestingly , V302I transport activity of tyrosine was found to be only 40 . 0 \u00b1 1 . 6% of wild-type SLC7A8 . Because the V302I mutation showed a substrate-dependent impact , tyrosine transport in the other variants was also tested ( Figure 5B ) . Other SLC7A8 variants found in patients with ARHL and controls showed similar decreased transport activity for alanine and tyrosine . Thus , the SLC7A8-induced tyrosine transport was clearly defective in the four variants found in patients with ARHL , whereas it was barely affected ( >85% of wild-type transport activity ) in the variants found in controls . \n The present work provides evidence that the amino acid transporter SLC7A8/SLC3A2 has a direct role in age-related hearing-loss ( ARHL ) . The ablation of SLC7A8 in a mouse model causes deafness with ARHL characteristics , defective audition at high-frequencies with early onset in homozygotes and progressive worsening in heterozygotes with age . Identification of rare variants in SLC7A8 gene together with amino acid transport loss-of-function in ARHL patients supports the concept that this gene has a role in the auditory system in association with other genetic and/or environmental factors . This study highlights amino acid transporters as new targets to study in largely uncharacterized hearing disorders . The description of SLC7A8 as a novel gene involved in a complex trait such as ARHL demonstrates the importance of amino acid homeostasis in preserving auditory function and suggests that genetic screening should be extended to consider other amino acid transporters as potential new genes involved in cochlear dysfunction . Our results may enable the identification of individuals susceptible to developing ARHL , allowing for early treatment or prevention of the disease . \n Animal experimentation complied with the ARRIVE guidelines and was conducted in accordance with Spanish ( RD 53/2013 ) and European ( Directive 2010/63/EU ) legislations . All protocols used in this study were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at IDIBELL in a facility accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International ( AAELAC accredited facility , B900010 ) . Mice procedures were done according with scientific , humane , and ethical principles . The studied mouse model did not show phenotype differences comparing male and female . Thus , to ensure that our research represents both genders , the studies describes in this work were performed using both sexes equitably . The number of biological and experimental replicates is detailed in the legend of each figure . Generation of the null Slc7a8 ( Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 ) was done by gene disruption . A coding region that includes exon 1 of the Slc7a8 gene was replaced for a neomycin resistance cassette by homologous recombination using a pBlueScript vector with two homologous arms ( right: 6 . 1 kb and left: 2 . 3 kb ) and two resistances ( neomycin and thymidine kinase ) in 5\u2019 region of the gene ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . ES cells transfection and microinjection experiments were done by GenOway ( Lyon-France ) . Chimera mouse was outcrossed with a wild\u2010type C57BL6/J mouse to obtain first generation ( F1 ) of Slc7a8 heterozygous ( Slc7a8+/\u2212 ) in a mixed C57BL6/J\u2010129Sv background . Intercross of F1 resulted in the analyzed F2 generation , which contemplates the three genotypes: wild type , Slc7a8+/\u2212 and Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 knockout mice . The pure inbred genetic background was generated backcrossing Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 F1 mice in the mixed C57BL6/J\u2010129Sv strain for 10 generations with pure C57BL6/J wild-type mice alternating male and females to avoid a genetic drift in the X and Y chromosomes . Mice genotype was confirmed by triplex-PCR using DNA from the tail . Primers used were forward: 5\u2019GGAGCGATCTGCGGAGTGA3\u2019; reverse: 5\u2019ACAGAGTGCGCTCCTACCCT3\u2019 and reverse KO-specific: 5\u2019CGGTGGGCTCTATGGGTCTA3\u2019 , and Standard DNA polymerase ( Biotools Ref:10 . 002 ) . The PCR products are 458 bp ( wild type allele ) and 180 bp ( Slc7a8\u2212/\u2212 allele ) fragment . Protein analysis was done by western blotting using total membrane samples . Frozen tissues ( 50\u2013100 mg ) were homogenized in 5 mL of membrane buffer ( 25 mM HEPES \u2013 4 mM EDTA \u2013 250 mM sucrose \u2013 and protease inhibitors ) and centrifuged at 10 , 000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C . Supernatant was centrifuged at 200 , 000xg for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C . The pellet was resuspended in 150 \u03bcL of membrane buffer using a 25G syringe . Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit ( Thermo Scientific Ref:23225 ) was used for protein quantification . Polyclonal rabbit antibody against mouse SLC7A8 protein was generated using an antigen against the C\u2010terminal region ( peptide sequence: PIFKPTPVKDPDSEEQP ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Serum extracts from inoculated rabbits were purified with protein G and used as primary antibody . Detection was by chemiluminescent reaction using ECL ( GE Healthcare Ref:RPN2232 ) and autoradiography ( Amersham Hyperfilm Ref:28906839 ) . For specific SLC7A8 light subunit detection , samples were run in the presence of 100 mM of dithiothreitol ( SigmaAldrich Ref:D9779 ) . Rotarod ( Panlab Ref:LE8500 ) . The experimental design consisted of two training trials ( TR ) at the minimum speed ( 4 rpm ) followed of two different tasks: ( a ) motor coordination and balance were assessed by measuring the latency to fall off the rod in consecutive trials with increasing fixed rotational speeds ( FRS 4 , 10 , 14 , 19 , 24 , and 34 rpm ) . The animals were allowed to stay on the rod for a maximum period of 1 min per trial and a resting period of 5 min was left between trials . ( b ) In the accelerating rod test , the rotation speed was increased from 4 to 40 rpm during two sessions of 1 min . For each trial , the elapsed time until the mouse fell off the rod was recorded . Treadmill ( Panlab Ref:LE8710MTS ) : During two training trials ( TR ) , the inclination of the treadmill was increased from 0\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 from the horizontal plane at different speeds ( 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 and 50 cm/s ) . Whenever an animal fell off the belt , foot shocks were applied for a maximal duration of 1 s . After the shock , mice were retrieved and placed back . Morris water maze ( MWM ) : Mice were tested over 4 days ( four trials/session , 10 min inter-trial intervals ) . The Morris Water Maze test consists of a circular tank ( 150 cm diameter , 100 cm high ) filled with opaque water ( with non-toxic white paint ) and maintained at 21 \u00b1 2\u00b0C . A removable circular platform ( 8 cm diameter ) was located in a fixed position ( NE quadrant ) inside the pool . The pool was surrounded by white curtains , with cues affixed . The test was performed under low non-aversive lighting conditions ( 50 lux ) . An overhead camera connected to video-tracking software ( SMART , Panlab SL . , Spain ) will be used to monitor the animal\u2019s behavior . Latency to reach the platform , total distance travelled , speed and time in zones will be recorded for posterior data analysis . The maze was surrounded by white curtains with black patterns affixed , to provide an arrangement of spatial cues . A pre-training session was performed in which the platform was visible in the center ( day 1 ) , followed by five acquisition sessions during which the platform was submerged 2 cm below the water ( days 2\u20136 ) . In each trial , mice were introduced in the pool from one of the random starting locations . Mice failing to find the platform within 60 s . were placed on it for 10 s . At the end of every trial the mice were dried for 15 min in a heater . Escape latencies , length of the swimming paths and swimming speed for each animal and trial were monitored and computed by a tracking system connected to a video camera placed above the pool . Pre-pulse inhibition of acoustic startle response ( PPI ) ( Panlab Ref:LE116 ) : Training was 5 min of habituation time to the apparatus with a background noise level of 70 dB and then exposed to six blocks of 7 trial types in pseudo-random order with 15 s . inter-trial intervals . The trials: 1 s of a 120 dB , 8000 kHz sound preceded 100 ms . by a 40 ms pre-pulse ( PP ) sound of 74 , 78 , 82 , 86 or 90 dB . The startle response was recorded for 65 ms , measuring every 1 ms . from the onset of the startle stimulus . Restrain stressor ( LabResearch Ref:G05 ) : Mice were habituated for 3 days prior the experiment collecting 10\u201315 \u03bcL of blood from tail . All sets were carried in the same room at the same time to minimize environmental variations and corticosterone fluctuations as a result of circadian rhythms . Mice were placed for 15 min in the conditioning unit and 75 \u03bcL of tail\u2019s blood was collected . For recovery mice were placed into a clean cage for 90 min . Blood corticosterone were determined by Corticosterone EIA kit ( Enzo Ref:ADI900097 ) . Hearing was evaluated by recording the auditory brainstem responses ( ABR ) with a System 3 TDT Evoked Potential Workstation ( Tucker Davis Technologies TDT , Alachua , FL , USA ) as previously described ( Cediel et al . , 2006; Riquelme et al . , 2010 ) . Briefly , mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine ( 100 mg/kg ) and xylazine ( 10 mg/kg ) , and placed inside a sound chamber . Broadband click ( 0 . 1 ms ) and tone bursts ( 5 ms ) at 8 , 16 , 20 , 28 and 40 kHz were delivered with an open field speaker ( MF1 , TDT ) at an intensity range from 90 to 10 dB sound pressure level ( SPL ) in 5\u201310 dB SPL steps . The electrical responses were amplified and averaged and the ANABR recordings analyzed with BioSig software ( TDT ) to determine hearing thresholds in response to each stimulus , peak and interpeak latencies and peak amplitudes . Animals were kept thermostatized and monitored during both anesthesia and the following recovery period . Mice were perfused through vascular system with 4% PFA and inner ear and brain samples were collected . The cochlea was dissected , post-fixed and decalcified in 0 . 3 M EDTA pH 6 . 5 ( Sigma-Aldrich Ref:E1644 ) for seven days . Decalcified cochleae were embedded in OCT or paraffin as reported ( Murillo-Cuesta et al . , 2012 ) . Deparaffinized cochlear sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for general cytoarchitecture evaluation . Immunohistochemistry: Floating brain tissue sections were incubated with 3% H2O2 in 10% methanol in PBS for 10 min . Blocking buffer with: 0 . 2% gelatine , 0 . 2% Triton x-100% and 10% FBS for 30 min . Primary antibody: anti-SLC7A8 1/500 in blocking buffer ON at 4\u00b0C with agitation . Secondary antibody: 1/200 biotinylated anti rabbit in blocking buffer for 1 hr at RT . Third antibody: 1/100 of A\u00a0+\u00a0B conjugate ( Vectastain , Ref:ABC kit ) in blocking buffer for 1 hr at RT . Develop staining: 0 . 03%DAB in PBS for 5 min . Reaction: incubate 0 . 03%DAB\u00a0+1/10 . 000 H2O2 for 2\u20137 min with agitation . Reaction was stopped by rinsing with PBS . Sections were dried and dehydrated before mounting . Detection was using a bright-light microscope . Immunofluorescence: OCT tissue sections were permeabilized by incubating for 10 min with 0 . 1% Triton X-100 and incubated as reported ( Sanchez-Calderon et al . , 2010; de Iriarte Rodr\u00edguez et al . , 2015b ) with the following primary antibodies: anti-SLC7A8 ( 1/200 ) , -s100 ( 1/1000 , Sigma-Aldrich Ref:S2532 ) , -Kir4 . 1 ( 1/200 , Merck Millipore Ref:AB5818 ) , -IBA1 ( 1/100 , Abcam Ref:ab5076 ) , or with Phalloidin ( 1/100 , Thermo Fisher Scientific Ref:A22287 ) , ON at 4\u00b0C . Sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies: ( 1:300 , Thermo Fisher Scientific Ref:A-11034 Goat anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 , Ref:A-11030 Goat anti-Mouse Alexa Fluor 546 , Ref:A-21206 Donkey anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 , Ref:A-11056 Donkey anti-Goat Alexa Fluor 546 ) for 2 hr at RT . Detection by confocal microscopy ( Leica , Ref:LSM 780 Zeiss ) . Four sections of apex , middle and basal turns of the cochlea were quantified using the same settings , including argon laser voltage , for the quantification . Using Fiji software , the sum of the intensity of all stacks ( 2 . 6 \u03bcm in the z axis along the 10 \u03bcm section ) from the spiral ligaments\u00a0+\u00a0stria vascularis area was extracted . Data were analyzed with Prism 7 statistic software package ( Graph Pad Software , Inc . ) . Statistical significance was determined by Student\u2019s t test for unpaired samples . The number of biological and experimental replicates are detailed in the legend of each figure . RNA was isolated using RNeasy ( Qiagen ) from 1 to 2 cochleae; its integrity and concentration were assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 ( Agilent Technologies ) . At least , three mice per condition were used . cDNA was then generated by reverse transcription ( High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit; Applied Biosystems ) and gene expression analyzed in triplicate by qPCR using TaqMan Gene Expression Assay kits ( Applied Biosystems ) . The following probes were used: potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 2 ( Kcnq2 ) Mm00440080_m1; potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 3 ( Kcnq3 ) Mm00548884_m1; potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 5 ( Kcnq5 ) Mm01226041_m1; prestin ( Slc26a5 ) Mm00446145_m1; T-box transcription factor TBX18 ( Tbx18 ) Mm00470177_m1; interleukin 1 beta ( Il1b ) Mm00434228m1; interleukin 6 ( Il6 ) Mm00446190m1; solute carrier family 7 ( cationic amino acid transporter , y\u00a0+\u00a0system ) , member 8 ( Slc7a8 ) Mm01318971m1 . PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Real-Time PCR System using Hprt1 or RPLP0 as the endogenous housekeeping gene . Relative quantification values were calculated using the 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method . All procedures have been already reported ( de Iriarte Rodr\u00edguez et al . , 2015a ) . A total of 147 Subjects were recruited in North-Eastern Italy isolated villages ( FVG Genetic Park ) ( Esko et al . , 2013 ) and from one isolated village from Southern Italy ( Carlantino ) . Subjects underwent a clinical evaluation to exclude any syndromic form of hearing loss or other systemic illnesses linked with sensorineural hearing loss . Audiometric tests using standard audiometers were carried out for each subject . Measurements have been obtained after any acoustically obstructing wax was removed . Thresholds for six different frequencies ( 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 kHz ) were measured and then a pure-tone average for high frequencies ( P-TAH ) was computed by taking the average of 4 and 8 kHz . To avoid non-genetic variations in the hearing phenotype ( e . g . monolateral hearing loss ) , the best hearing ear was considered for each individual . Cases were defined as people older than 50 years old having PTAH\u00a0\u226540 , while controls were subjects more than 50 years old with PTAH\u00a0\u226425 . All studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of IRCCS Burlo Garofolo , Trieste , Italy and consent forms for clinical and genetic studies have been signed by each participant . All research was conducted according to the ethical standards as defined by the Helsinki Declaration . Blood samples were collected and used to extract DNA using standard protocols . Low coverage whole genome sequence was generated using Illumina technology ( Genome Analyzer and HiSeq 2000 ) at the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute and Beijing Genomics Institute . Data coverage was ranging from 4 to 10X . A multi-sample genotype calling was performed and standard quality filters were applied . The detailed pipeline has already been described elsewhere ( Timpson et al . , 2014 ) . Variants belonging to SLC7A8 gene were extracted using bcftools [http://samtools . github . io/bcftools/] and annotated with ANNOVAR ( Wang et al . , 2010 ) . Only the exonic variants were further considered . Finally , variants of interest were confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing on a 3500 Dx Genetic Analyzer ( Life Technologies , CA ) , using ABI PRISM 3 . 1 Big Dye terminator chemistry ( Life Technologies ) per manufacturer\u2019s instructions . Mutation frequencies were compared with public databases such as Esp6500siv2 ( NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project ) , 1000 g ( 1000 Genomes Project ) , Campion ( The Allele Frequency Net Database ) and ExAC ( The Exome Aggregation Consortium ) . For SLC7A8 we collected several statistics including the probability of loss of function intolerance ( pLI ) , where the closer pLI value is to 1 , the more LoF intolerant the gene could be considered . We also collected the missense Z score , a positive score indicates intolerance to missense variation whereas a negative Z score indicates that the gene had more missense variants than expected . The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) was used to introduce point mutations in SLC7A8 sequence , according to the manufacturer's protocol . The pcDNA3 . 1-StrepTag fused SLC7A8 construct was used as template ( Costa et al . , 2013 ) . Amino acid substitutions were introduced into SLC7A8 sequence using a compatible reverse primer and forward primers ( Figure 5\u2014source data 1 ) . All primers annealed to the coding sequence , and the position of the mutated codon was underlined . All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing and then used for transient transfection . HeLa cells ( Sigma Aldrich , Ref: 93021013 ) were maintained at 37\u00b0C/5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium ( Life Technologies ) supplemented with 10% ( v/v ) fetal bovine serum , 50 units/ml penicillin , 50 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin , and 2 mM l-glutamine . HeLa cells were transiently transfected with plasmid constructions mentioned above with the use of Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) following the manufacturer's protocol . Amino acid transport and fluorescence microscopy analyses were carried out 48 hr after transfection . To analyze the effect of the mutations on SLC7A8 protein expression and plasma membrane localization , fluorescence microscopy of Strep-tagged wild type and mutant transporters was performed on a semiconfluent monolayer of transfected HeLa cells cultured on glass coverslips . Glass coverslip-grown cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) labeled with Texas-Red ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) at 37\u00b0C for 10 min , rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline-Ca2+-Mg2+ and fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde . Fixed cells were blocked in blocking buffer ( 10% FBS and 0 . 1% saponin in PBS ) for 1 hr and then incubated for 1 hr with primary antibody ( anti-Strep Tag GT517 , 1/100; Abcam ) . Secondary goat-anti-mouse-FITC antibody ( Life Technologies ) was incubated for 2 hr protected from light and rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline . Nuclear staining was performed by incubating 1 \u00b5g/ml Hoechst ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 10 min , rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then mounted with aqua-poly/mount coverslipping medium ( Polysciences Inc . ) . Images were taken using a Nikon E1000 upright epifluorescence microscope . All images were captured during 200 ms except for those corresponding to V460E that were overexposed to 2 s to reveal the subcellular localization of this very low expressing variant . To quantify SLC7A8 wild type and mutated transporters expression levels in cells , a single in-focus plane was acquired . Using ImageJ ( v1 . 48 , NIH ) , an outline was drawn around each cell and area and mean fluorescence measured , along with several adjacent background readings . The total corrected cellular fluorescence ( TCCF ) =\u00a0integrated density \u2013 ( area of selected cell \u00d7 mean fluorescence of background readings ) , was calculated . Amino acid uptake was measured by exposing replicate cultures at room temperature to L- [3H]-labeled alanine or [3H]-tyrosine ( 1 \u03bcCi/ml; Perkin Elmer ) in sodium-free transport buffer ( 137 mM choline chloride , 5 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl2 , 1 mM MgSO4 , and 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ) . Initial rates of transport were determined using an incubation period of 1 min and 50 \u00b5M of cold alanine or tyrosine . Assays were terminated by washing with an excess volume of chilled transport buffer . Cells were lysed using 0 . 1% SDS and 100 mM NaOH and radioactivity measured in a scintillation counter . Uptake values were corrected by their total corrected cellular fluorescence ( TCCF ) for all transporters except for V460E mutant , which does not reach the plasmatic membrane . Behavior and ABR experiments using mice were not performed blind to genotype and treatment conditions , but as data acquisition was automated this will not affect data processing and analysis . The sample size was chosen according to the standard sample sizes used in the field and without applying any statistical method . The general criteria of exclusion were pre-established: ( 1 ) samples with a value that differed by more/less than two standard deviations from the mean value were excluded from the study . The statistical tests used in each experiment were appropriate to the type of groups , data and samples . Unpaired Student t-test was used for experiments with only two independent groups . Repeated measures two-way ANOVA was applied when we had to compare two independent groups ( genotype as the between subjects factor ) where repeated measurements of the dependent variable were obtained ( Rotarod and PPI ) . Data were analyzed with IBM SPSS 23 . 0 statistic software package ( Chicago , IL ) . Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and Levene's F test to assess the equality of variances . When significant differences were obtained , post hoc comparisons were performed using Bonferroni or Tamhane tests to compare the three genotypes . Normal distribution of data and homogeneity of variances was assessed using Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests , respectively . In most of the datasets these two assumptions were achieved . However , when not achieved and because we use comparable sample sizes and ANOVA is robust to normality violations , our results are still valid . Sphericity assumption was assessed using Mauchly\u2019s test and when not achieved Greenhouse correction was taken . Posthoc tests were performed using Bonferroni correction for individual comparisons . Bonferroni p<0 . 05 was assumed as critical value for significance throughout the study . Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS package ."}

These viruses inject their genetic material into bacterial cells and use the bacteria\u2019s own machinery to build the proteins they need to survive and infect other cells . To protect themselves , bacteria produce a molecule called S-adenosyl methionine , or SAM for short , which deposits marks on the bacteria\u2019s DNA . These marks help the bacteria distinguish their own genetic material from the genetic material of foreign invaders: any DNA not bearing the mark from SAM will be immediately broken down by the bacterial cell . This system helps to block many types of bacteriophage infections , but not all . Some bacteriophages carry genes that code for enzymes called SAMases , which can break down SAM , switching off the bacteria\u2019s defenses . The most well-known SAMase was first discovered in the 1960s in a bacteriophage called T3 . Chemical studies of this SAMase suggested that it works as a 'hydrolase' , meaning that it uses water to break SAM apart . New SAMases have since been discovered in bacteriophages from environmental water samples , which , despite being able to degrade SAM , are genetically dissimilar to one another and the SAMase in T3 . This brings into question whether these enzymes all use the same mechanism to break SAM down . To gain a better understanding of how these SAMases work , Guo , S\u00f6derholm , Kanchugal , Isaksen et al . solved the crystal structure of one of the newly discovered enzymes called Svi3-3 . This revealed three copies of the Svi3-3 enzyme join together to form a unit that SAM binds to at the border between two of the enzymes . Computer simulations of this structure suggested that Svi3-3 holds SAM in a position where it cannot interact with water , and that once in the grip of the SAMase , SAM instead reacts with itself and splits into two . Experiments confirmed these predictions for Svi3-3 and the other tested SAMases . Furthermore , the SAMase from bacteriophage T3 was also found to degrade SAM using the same mechanism . This shows that this group of SAMases are not hydrolases as originally thought , but in fact \u2018lyases\u2019: enzymes that break molecules apart without using water . These findings form a starting point for further investigations into how SAM lyases help bacteriophages evade detection . SAM has various different functions in other living organisms , and these lyases could be used to modulate the levels of SAM in future studies investigating its role .", "source": "The first S-adenosyl methionine ( SAM ) degrading enzyme ( SAMase ) was discovered in bacteriophage T3 , as a counter-defense against the bacterial restriction-modification system , and annotated as a SAM hydrolase forming 5\u2019-methyl-thioadenosine ( MTA ) and L-homoserine . From environmental phages , we recently discovered three SAMases with barely detectable sequence similarity to T3 SAMase and without homology to proteins of known structure . Here , we present the very first phage SAMase structures , in complex with a substrate analogue and the product MTA . The structure shows a trimer of alpha\u2013beta sandwiches similar to the GlnB-like superfamily , with active sites formed at the trimer interfaces . Quantum-mechanical calculations , thin-layer chromatography , and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrate that this family of enzymes are not hydrolases but lyases forming MTA and L-homoserine lactone in a unimolecular reaction mechanism . Sequence analysis and in vitro and in vivo mutagenesis support that T3 SAMase belongs to the same structural family and utilizes the same reaction mechanism . \n S-adenosyl methionine ( SAM ) plays many important roles in biology . It is an essential methyl donor for methyltransferases that act on nucleic acids , proteins , lipids , and small molecules , but is also involved in many other reactions , for\u00a0example , as a substrate used in biosynthesis of polyamines and quorum sensing molecules ( reviewed in Loenen , 2006 ) . It is also involved in epigenetic changes in many organisms ( Janke et al . , 2015; Su et al . , 2016 ) and in bacterial restriction-modification systems where methylation of DNA is used to distinguish foreign DNA from host DNA ( Wilson and Murray , 1991 ) . In early studies of nucleic acid methylation , it was observed that while infection of Escherichia coli with phage T1 , T2 , and T4 induced higher levels of DNA methylation , infection with phage T3 reduced the degree of methylation of not only DNA , but also tRNA and rRNA ( Gold and Hurwitz , 1964 ) . The reduction of methylation by T3 infection was associated with an immediate and dramatic lowering of the level of SAM in the E . coli cell extract . The degradation products were , using paper chromatography and chemical tests , identified as 5\u2019-methyl-thioadenosine ( MTA ) and L-homoserine ( Gold and Hurwitz , 1964; Figure 1 , top ) , which led to the claimed discovery of a potent T3-encoded SAM hydrolase enzyme ( Hausmann , 1967 ) . Subsequent work showed that the T3 SAMase was produced early in infection ( Gefter et al . , 1966 ) , encoded in the early transcribed portion of the phage genome ( Herrlich and Schweiger , 1970 ) and important for the counter defense of the bacteriophage against the type I restriction modification ( RM ) system of the host bacterium . In this type of RM system , SAM is essential for both methylation of host DNA and restriction of target sequences in the foreign DNA . Two potential mechanisms for how the RM system could be impaired were presented . First , the lowered SAM levels prevented methylation of the host genome and the SAM-dependent restriction of the phage genome ( Krueger et al . , 1975 ) . Second , inhibition was observed to be independent of SAM degradation and possibly linked to an interaction with the restriction enzyme ( Spoerel et al . , 1979; Studier and Movva , 1976 ) . Recently , three additional SAM degrading enzymes were identified in a screen for bacteriophage DNA that could rescue an auxotrophic E . coli mutant where the isoleucine biosynthetic ilvA gene was deleted . Investigations using proteomics and RNA-seq showed that the phage-encoded polypeptides induced up-regulation of the biosynthetic pathway for methionine by degradation of SAM ( Jerlstr\u00f6m Hultqvist et al . , 2018 ) , which together with the repressor protein MetJ acts as a co-repressor of the met regulon ( Weissbach and Brot , 1991 ) . Isoleucine biosynthesis was rescued through a promiscuous activity of one of the up-regulated enzymes , MetB ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . One of the newly identified SAM degrading enzymes , Svi3-3 , was cloned , expressed , and purified . In vitro activity assays demonstrated that Svi3-3 catalyzed conversion of SAM to MTA . We herein present the first structure of a phage-encoded SAMase and explore the reaction mechanism using both computational and experimental biochemistry . Strikingly , the results unambiguously show that the phage-encoded SAMases are not hydrolases , as believed since the 1960s , but lyases ( Figure 1 ) . \n The Svi3-3 enzyme was originally expressed from a library of fragmented environmental phage DNA . For this reason , the exact size of the original open reading frame was unknown , but an N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged 162 amino acid construct including some vector-derived sequence was shown to have SAMase activity ( Jerlstr\u00f6m Hultqvist et al . , 2018 ) . The phage-derived sequence was subcloned to allow proteolytic removal of the hexahistidine tag , and based on predictions of a disordered N terminus , truncated variants were made . Full-length and N-terminally truncated variants of Svi3-3 were expressed with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and purified on a Ni-column for structural studies . When expressed from the T7-promoter expression plasmid , the proteins were highly toxic and the tightly regulated , arabinose-inducible BL21-AI cells had to be used to allow cell growth until induction . An N-terminally truncated 146 amino acid construct of Svi3-3 , where the hexahistidine tag had been removed ( Svi3-3_d19 , Supplementary file 1-table 1 ) , formed crystals in the\u00a0presence of SAM or the analogue S-adenosyl homocysteine ( SAH ) . We here number its sequence starting at the N terminus of the TEV-cleaved protein , corresponding to an offset of \u221216 in relation to previous work ( Jerlstr\u00f6m Hultqvist et al . , 2018 ) . The crystals diffracted to 1 . 45 \u00c5 resolution in space group F4132 and the structure was solved using ab initio methods with Arcimboldo ( Rodr\u00edguez et al . , 2009; Figure 2A , F , Table 1 ) . There is one monomer in the asymmetric unit , forming a trimer around the threefold crystallographic axis . Apart from the disordered C-terminal 16 residues , the full structure could be built . Svi3-3 forms a trimer of ferredoxin-like fold alpha\u2013beta sandwiches , where each subunit has two helices on the outside and a five-stranded anti-parallel beta sheet at the center ( Figure 2A\u00a0and\u00a0B , Figure 2\u2014video 1 ) . The subunits pack in a triangular manner , forming continuous beta sheets with their neighbors and are each in a \u2018velcro-like\u2019 topology where residues 2\u20136 at the N\u00a0terminus of one subunit form beta-sheet interactions with residues 120\u2013124 in \u03b28 of another subunit ( Figure 2A ) . The long \u03b25 forms beta-sheet interactions with both of the other monomers through interactions between the backbones around residues 51 and 55 . In addition , the end of the \u03b25\u2013\u03b26 hairpin packs against \u03b11 of another monomer . The trimer interfaces are each stabilized by a single salt bridge , numerous hydrogen bonds , and by hydrophobic interactions at the center . The substrate analogue SAH binds at the interface between two subunits ( Figure 2C\u00a0and\u00a0D ) , enclosed by the \u03b25\u2013\u03b26 hairpin at the edge of the sheet . The adenosine base is recognized by interactions with the backbone carbonyl and amide of Ile77 and the side chain of Ser50 . The ribose forms interactions with Ser50 from one subunit and Glu69 and Ser71 from the other subunit . The homoserine moiety forms interactions with backbone groups and the side chains of Glu69 and Gln104 . In the structure from co-crystallization with SAM , catalysis has occurred and the product MTA is observed in identical position as the corresponding part of SAH , with the methyl group pointing away from Glu69 ( Figure 2E\u00a0and\u00a0F ) , while a proline molecule from the cryo buffer is bound in the second half of the active site , mimicking the second product . The protein structures are virtually identical in the\u00a0presence of SAH and MTA ( root mean square deviation [RMSD] of 0 . 16 \u00c5 over 129 C\u03b1 atoms ) . To test if the structure contains all the elements needed for activity in vivo , and because the start and end of the native phage protein sequence remain unknown , constructs truncated to only contain the ordered parts were tested for their ability to rescue the ilvA knockout mutant . Indeed , the N-terminally truncated construct additionally lacking the disordered C\u00a0terminus provided similar rescue to full-length Svi3-3 , indicating that neither tail is needed for SAMase activity ( data not shown ) . Based on this result , all further experiments were performed with the 146 amino acid Svi3-3_d19 construct ( Supplementary file 1-table 1 ) . Crystallization in the\u00a0absence of ligands led to a lower-resolution apo structure . The structure of Svi3-3 in apo state is overall very similar to the complex structures ( RMSD of 0 . 84 \u00c5 over 124 C\u03b1 atoms ) , but there is a shift of the N\u00a0terminus , a conformational change of residues 7\u20139 to form a more extensive interaction with \u03b29 and the preceding loop of the neighboring subunit , leading to a slight loosening of the trimer ( Figure 3 ) . In addition , residues 64\u00a0and\u00a065 in the \u03b25\u2013\u03b26 hairpin are disordered . Small angle X-ray scattering ( SAXS ) data confirmed that Svi3-3 has a similar trimeric structure in apo state as in the\u00a0presence of SAM ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , indicating that product release and substrate binding do not require trimer dissociation . A search for structures with similar fold and connectivity as Svi3-3 using PDBeFold ( Krissinel and Henrick , 2004 ) showed that bacterial PII signaling proteins and cation tolerance proteins of CutA type ( belonging to a PII-like family ) in the GlnB-like superfamily have similar trimeric architectures of ferredoxin-like folds . The closest structural neighbors superpose with RMSDs above 2 \u00c5 over no more than 86 C\u03b1 atoms . PII regulatory proteins bind ATP/ADP and 2-oxoglutarate at the trimer interface , and conformational changes of loops in response to ligand binding and modification modulates binding to other proteins ( Forchhammer and L\u00fcddecke , 2016 ) . Intriguingly , the position of ATP is similar to where SAH binds to Svi3-3 , although the binding site appears non-conserved . The reaction mechanism of the presumed SAM hydrolases ( Figure 1 ) is previously unexplored . Two possibilities would either be that the enzyme provides a catalytic base that by deprotonation activates a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the \u03b3 carbon of SAM , or that a catalytic residue from the enzyme acts as nucleophile and attacks the \u03b3 carbon , forming a covalent intermediate with the substrate that subsequently gets hydrolyzed by reaction with a water molecule . In both scenarios , a catalytic amino acid in proximity to the site of hydrolysis would be needed . Inspection of the active site shows that Glu69 is relatively close to the site of cleavage ( Figure 2C ) , making this residue the most likely candidate . Another possible residue that could act as a base or a nucleophile is Tyr58 , which in such case would need to donate a proton to the nearby Glu105 ( Figure 2C ) . To test these possibilities , Svi3-3 mutants Y58F , E69Q , E69A , and E105Q were constructed , expressed , and purified for in vitro activity assays . The Y58F mutant eluted mainly as monomer , indicating a de-stabilized trimer , while all other mutants migrated as trimers . The activity of wild-type ( WT ) and mutant Svi3-3 variants in conversion of SAM to MTA was determined at 1 mM substrate concentration . The\u00a0WT truncated Svi3-3 construct showed an average turnover of 9 . 5 s\u22121 at 25\u00b0C , nearly doubled compared to the full length , His-tagged construct ( Jerlstr\u00f6m Hultqvist et al . , 2018 ) , but with significant deviation between batches . The mutant enzymes all showed reduced activity compared to WT ( Figure 4A , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . For the Y58F and E105Q mutants , activity was fivefold and threefold reduced , whereas for the E69Q and E69A mutants , activity was nearly abolished ( 4500- and 1500-fold reduction ) . Thus , Glu69 is in vitro critical for substrate binding , catalysis , or both . To characterize the binding of substrate and product to Svi3-3 , thermal unfolding experiments were performed using differential scanning fluorimetry ( DSF ) ( Niesen et al . , 2007 ) . In the\u00a0presence of the substrate SAM , its analogue SAH , or the reaction product MTA , the melting temperature of the WT enzyme increased by up to 30\u00b0C , demonstrating a major stabilizing effect on the structure ( Figure 4B ) . Under the assay conditions , the substrate is most likely turned over , and as a result , the sample with SAM is stabilized by binding of MTA . A large stabilization was also seen in thermal denaturation assays followed by circular dichroism in the\u00a0presence of MTA ( data not shown ) . The DSF assay clearly demonstrates that the E69Q mutant is not impaired in binding of SAM or MTA , but that binding of SAH is abolished ( Figure 4B ) . However , despite extensive trials , a structure of Svi3-3 E69Q with SAM could not be obtained . A crystal structure of Svi3-3 E69Q with MTA shows no major conformational changes of the enzyme , but a minor shift of the mutated side chain close to the reaction site ( data not shown ) . A structure-guided multiple sequence alignment of Svi3-3 with T3 SAMase and two other polypeptides annotated with SAMase activity ( Orf1 and Svi3-7 [Jerlstr\u00f6m Hultqvist et al . , 2018] ) but with barely detectable sequence similarity suggests that a similar core fold can be formed by all aligned enzymes ( Figure 5 ) . Only three amino acids are strictly conserved , and only a handful conservatively substituted . Based on the SAH structure , all the conserved residues are important for binding of SAM . Gly56 packs against the ribose , not allowing space for a side chain , Glu69 and Gln104 as described above form hydrogen bonds to the ligand , and Tyr58 packs against the \u03b3 carbon and forms a hydrogen bond to Glu105 , enclosing the ligand . The Svi3-3 structure allows interpretation of the effect of loss-of-function mutations identified in the previous complementation studies ( Jerlstr\u00f6m Hultqvist et al . , 2018 ) . One group of disabling mutations would act to sterically disturb the interaction between the monomers and/or change the character of the interface ( R14C , V33D , V52D , E110K , and\u00a0G115V ) . Mutation of the conserved glycine ( G56D ) would clash with the ribose in MTA and SAH and thereby disturb substrate binding . The remaining mutations ( A13V , A93G , and\u00a0G95D ) are likely to affect folding or stability of the structure . To validate the structure-guided sequence alignment , Glu68 in T3 SAMase , predicted by the sequence alignment ( Figure 5 ) to be the equivalent of Glu69 in Svi3-3 , was mutagenized and tested for in vitro activity . The E68Q mutant of T3 SAMase retained 20\u201330% activity compared to WT . In addition , mutant variants carried on an inducible plasmid were tested for their ability to rescue the \u0394ilvA auxotrophic mutant ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1; Jerlstr\u00f6m Hultqvist et al . , 2018 ) under uninduced and induced conditions . Because of its toxicity at higher expression level , WT T3 SAMase only shows rescue under uninduced conditions ( Jerlstr\u00f6m Hultqvist et al . , 2018 ) . Both T3 SAMase and Orf1 contain two consecutive acidic residues ( E67 and E68 in T3 SAMase , E50 and D51 in Orf1 , Figure 5 ) , both of which were conservatively mutated . No rescue was observed either for the Svi3-3 E69Q , Svi3-3 E69A , Orf1 E50Q , or the T3 SAMase E68Q mutants , suggesting a lost or reduced activity of these variants ( Table 2 ) and validating the sequence alignment . Mutations of the neighboring acidic residues ( E67Q in T3 SAMase and D51N in Orf1 ) still allowed rescue under the same conditions as the corresponding WT . Given that we observed measurable activity for the T3 SAMase E68Q mutant in vitro , we decided to insert different variants of the T3 SAMase on the chromosome , to allow titration of the expression levels . To this end , the different mutant gene variants were placed downstream of the pBAD promoter in a \u0394ilvA knockout mutant . Different concentrations of L-arabinose were used to induce the expression of these variants to determine if the variants could show in vivo activity at higher expression levels . For the E68Q mutant , growth was only observed at the highest concentration of arabinose ( 0 . 1% ) , where low enzymatic activity can be compensated by increased enzyme levels ( Supplementary file 1-table 2 ) . To gain further insights into substrate binding to Svi3-3 , molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations were performed . An initial complex of Svi3-3 with SAM was generated from docking calculations , which indicated a slight binding preference for SAM over SAH . A total of 100 ns of MD simulation was run for both apo Svi3-3 and the SAM complex ( Figure 6 ) . The simulation of the complex revealed that the SAM conformation in the active site is very stable , particularly the methionine part ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The time evolution of the backbone RMSD with respect to the initial structure is shown in Figure 6A and reaches stability in about 30 ns . In agreement with the experimental structure with SAH , the carboxylate group is strongly stabilized by the backbone amide hydrogens of Glu105 and Ser106 , whereas the amino group is primarily stabilized by the side-chains of Glu69 and Gln104 ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . Moreover , the positively charged methionine S atom is consistently stabilized through a \u03c0-cation interaction with the Tyr58 side-chain ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . The adenosine part of SAM is primarily stabilized by H-bond interactions with the side-chain of Ser50 and the backbone of Val57 and Ile77 ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , as in the crystal structures with SAH and MTA ( Figure 2C and E ) . Comparison of the average root mean square fluctuation ( RMSF ) of the protein backbone shows that Svi3-3 is more flexible throughout the 100 ns MD simulation in apo state ( RMSF for trimer 0 . 91 \u00c52 ) than with SAM in the active site ( RMSF for trimer 0 . 86 \u00c52 ) ( Figure 6B ) . Interestingly , the residues surrounding the active site cavity , and in particular the methionine-stabilizing residues 104\u2013106 , become significantly more flexible in the apo simulations ( Figure 6B ) . Thus , 100 ns of MD simulation demonstrated that apo Svi3-3 shows the highest flexibility in the regions surrounding the active site , and that these regions become significantly more rigid upon substrate binding . The mechanism of enzymatic SAMase activity is previously unexplored . Thus , the observed active site conformations from the MD simulations were used to build a 194-atom cluster model ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B ) to investigate the SAMase reaction mechanism with density functional theory ( DFT ) . The simulations revealed one potential , but not optimally positioned , water molecule for hydrolysis that was stabilized by H-bonds between the backbone of Ser106 and Gln104 , but there were no obvious residues within reach to activate this water by acting as a base . Glu69 was initially suspected to either work as a catalytic base , activating a water molecule for hydrolysis , or as a nucleophile , attacking the \u03b3-carbon of SAM . However , no water molecule was observed with a suitable position with respect to Glu69 in the experimental structures or after the MD simulation , indicating that the role as a catalytic base is unlikely . Moreover , the observed SAM configuration relative to Glu69 was not optimal for attack on the \u03b3-carbon of SAM . DFT geometry optimizations furthermore failed to locate any stationary point ( transition state ) for the attack , suggesting that the role as a nucleophile is also unlikely . Thus , it seems that the main role of Glu69 is to bind and orient the substrate in the active site by accepting H-bonds primarily from the amino group of SAM , but also from the 3\u2019-hydroxyl group of the ribose ring ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . In fact , the only residue in the active site oriented properly for a potential hydrolase reaction mechanism is Tyr58 . However , DFT calculations could exclude the possibility of Tyr58 acting as a nucleophile in such a mechanism . Further DFT geometry optimization , however , revealed a completely different mechanism , a unimolecular reaction resulting in the formation of homoserine lactone ( Figure 7A ) . The DFT optimized stationary points shown in Figure 7A indicate that Tyr58 is deprotonated and bridged by a water molecule to the protonated Glu105 . Deprotonation of Tyr58 enhances its cation-\u03c0 interaction with the S atom of SAM and the electrostatic preorganization weakens the bond to the ribose ring . Together with the amino group interaction with Glu69 this makes the configuration of SAM in the active site of Svi3-3 susceptible to intramolecular carboxylate oxygen attack on the \u03b3-carbon . The activation energy for the formation of homoserine lactone in the DFT cluster model was calculated to be 16 . 8 kcal/mol with an exothermic reaction energy of \u22125 . 7 kcal/mol ( Figure 7B ) . These values were rather insensitive to the choice of dielectric constant , as a change from \u03b5\u00a0=\u00a04 to \u03b5\u00a0=\u00a080 yields an energy barrier of 16 . 1 kcal/mol and a reaction energy of \u22126 . 3 kcal/mol . However , since our active site cluster model by necessity is limited in size , it seems possible that the predicted net proton transfer from Tyr58 to Glu105 could be caused by the DFT optimization disfavoring ion pairs with charge separation over a larger distance ( Glu-\u2026TyrOH\u2026S+ ) , and instead moving the proton from Tyr58 to Glu105 ( the initial configuration had the proton on Tyr58 ) . In order to examine this issue , the reaction energetics were recalculated with the proton constrained to remain on Tyr58 , maintaining the standard protonation states of the tyrosine and Glu105 . This , in fact , yielded very similar energetics with a barrier of 15 . 5 kcal/mol and a reaction energy of \u22126 . 1 kcal/mol ( \u03b5\u00a0=\u00a04 ) , indicating that the proton relay is not a necessary feature of the reaction mechanism . In the product state ( Figure 7A ) , Glu69 shares a proton with the amino group of SAM , and a water molecule makes strong hydrogen bonds with Tyr58 and Glu105 , irrespective of protonation state at the start of the reaction . This water appeared to be a good candidate for nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of homoserine lactone , thereby forming a tetrahedral intermediate which could break down to homoserine . The calculated barrier for this step is 17 . 5 kcal/mol , which is not unrealistically high , but the reaction energy for the tetrahedral intermediate is 25 . 2 kcal/mol relative to the homoserine lactone ( Figure 7B ) . Thus , the DFT calculations indicate that Svi3-3 forms homoserine lactone , but that further breakdown to homoserine does not occur in the active site . Most importantly , the DFT calculations clearly predict that Svi3-3 is not a SAM hydrolase , but rather a SAM lyase , catalyzing the unimolecular transformation of SAM to homoserine lactone , whereafter this product is released from the active site . One prediction from the suggested reaction mechanism is that the carboxyl group of SAM is essential for the degradation of SAM by Svi3-3 . To test this hypothesis , decarboxylated SAM ( dcSAM ) was produced enzymatically from SAM using SAM decarboxylase ( Cohn et al . , 1983 ) and used as a substrate in the MTA formation assay . In support of the proposed mechanism , we observed no Svi3-3-catalyzed production of MTA from dcSAM ( Figure 8 ) . However , in a DSF binding assay , dcSAM does not induce a thermal stabilization of Svi3-3 ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Comparison with the strong stabilization by SAM/MTA and SAH ( Figure 4B ) suggests that the carboxyl group of SAM is required for binding to Svi3-3 . Our activity assay ( Jerlstr\u00f6m Hultqvist et al . , 2018 ) is based on detection of MTA that is also observed in the structure from co-crystallization of Svi3-3 with SAM . Thus , MTA is indeed formed in the reaction . In order to test the predictions from the DFT calculations , we used thin-layer chromatography ( TLC ) , commonly used for separation of amino acids , to determine whether homoserine was formed . The substrate SAM and the products could be separated by TLC , the adenosyl-containing compounds were visualized under UV light , and the amines were stained with ninhydrin after pre-treatment with \u03b2-mercapto ethanol ( BME ) . Interestingly , we observed a reaction product with mobility and color upon staining distinct from homoserine , proving that Svi3-3 is not a SAM hydrolase . The same assay was performed with T3 SAMase and Orf1 and comparison with reference samples shows that for all three enzymes , a reaction product is observed that on TLC migrates and stains similar to homoserine lactone ( Figure 9A ) , supporting the hypothesis that Svi3-3 , T3 SAMase and Orf1 are indeed SAM lyases . To confirm the identity of the reaction product , the enzymatic reaction products for Svi3-3 were examined with 1H nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) and the spectrum compared to reference spectra for SAM , homoserine , and homoserine lactone ( Figure 9B , Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1 , Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The results confirm that homoserine lactone is formed on the same time scale as MTA . Upon incubation of homoserine lactone in phosphate buffer at pH 7 . 4 , the lactone is transformed to homoserine through spontaneous hydrolysis ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . \n Svi3-3 represents the first structure of a phage-encoded SAM degrading enzyme . There is no previously established reaction mechanism for these enzymes , and to our knowledge there are only two previous examples of enzymes that can cleave a trialkyl sulfonium substrate . A distinct type of SAM lyase , 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase ( ACC synthase , EC 4 . 4 . 1 . 14 ) exists in higher plants and some fungi . The products of this enzyme are MTA and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate that is used in the biosynthetic pathway for ethylene . The reaction is PLP-dependent and the enzyme is structurally and mechanistically unrelated to the phage encoded SAM lyases ( Capitani et al . , 1999 ) . Instead , Svi3-3 shows structural similarity to PII and PII-like proteins , many of which bind nucleotides or nucleotide-derived metabolites in the inter-subunit clefts . Despite very low levels of sequence identity within those families , they have been suggested to have arisen by divergent evolution from a common ancestor ( Forchhammer and L\u00fcddecke , 2016 ) . Based on this similarity , we tested binding of ATP , ADP , and AMP to Svi3-3 by DSF , but detected no interaction . Still , these two families of enzymes may have a distant evolutionary relationship . Svi3-3 forms a trimer in solution both in the\u00a0absence and in the\u00a0presence of substrate ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Thermal shift binding experiments showed a major stabilization of Svi3-3 upon binding of MTA or SAH ( Figure 4B ) . Comparisons of the apo and ligand-bound structures ( Figure 3 ) as well as MD simulations ( Figure 6B ) indicate that stabilization is caused by tightening of the trimer around the ligand . Results presented here show that E69 in Svi3-3 plays a critical role in the enzyme , and the failure in getting crystals of an E69Q mutant with SAM suggests that binding of SAM may be associated with conformational changes that are incompatible with crystal packing or with the crystallization conditions . The observation that the E69Q mutant binds SAM but does not bind SAH indicates that although SAH only lacks one methyl group compared to SAM , the complex structure of WT Svi3-3 with SAH may not fully mimic the substrate-bound state . Since MTA and SAH show a perfect overlap between the two structures ( Figure 2D ) , any such difference in binding mode between SAM and SAH is likely to involve the methionine end of the substrate , where MD indicates that Tyr58 forms a cation-\u03c0 interaction with the positively charged sulfur . The reason why the E69Q mutant does not bind to SAH may be that two important interactions are lacking; Q69 cannot accept two hydrogen bonds ( Figure 2C ) and there is no positive charge on the sulfur that can participate in the cation-\u03c0 interaction with Tyr58 ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Prompted by DFT calculations producing high energy barriers for a hydrolysis reaction within the active site of Svi3-3 ( Figure 7B ) , the TLC assays and NMR show unambiguously that Svi3-3 is a SAM lyase forming homoserine lactone and MTA ( Figure 9 ) . The lactone is spontaneously converted to homoserine in solution ( Wu et al . , 1983; Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3 , Figure 10 ) . Previous attempts to set up a coupled SAM hydrolase activity assay for Svi3-3 using homoserine dehydrogenase or homoserine kinase failed to show homoserine production with the same rate as MTA production ( data not shown ) . The observed rates were 1000-fold lower , and we can now explain that this is due to the slow and un-catalyzed formation of homoserine from the homoserine lactone that is enzymatically formed . Computational work by others suggests that the non-enzymatic degradation of SAM to homoserine lactone and MTA is slowed down by the favorable interactions of the carboxylate group with water ( Lankau et al . , 2017 ) . Thus , Svi3-3 increases the reactivity of the carboxylate group by excluding water from the corresponding part of the active site , while stabilizing a reactive conformation of the substrate . For this unimolecular reaction mechanism ( Figure 10A ) , only very few strictly conserved residues are required , as illustrated in the multiple-sequence alignment ( Figure 5 ) . Both hydrogen bond acceptors of Glu69 seem critical for stabilization of the reactive state ( Figure 10 ) , and Svi3-3 E69Q has nearly abolished activity . However , the effect of the corresponding mutation in T3 SAMase is not quite as dramatic . Since the level of sequence identity between the two enzymes is low , there will be many differences in the active site , and additional interactions may contribute to stabilizing the reactive state for the same mechanism in T3 SAMase . The only previously partly characterized phage SAMase comes from phage T3 ( Hausmann , 1967 ) . It was identified based on its anti-restriction activity , but the mechanism was never fully clarified . Anti-restriction activity of the closely related T7 phage is based on the OCR protein that forms a structure that mimics B-form DNA and blocks DNA binding of EcoKI and other type I RM systems ( Walkinshaw et al . , 2002 ) . The first structure from the SAM lyase enzyme family that we present here clearly proves that they have no structural similarity to the OCR protein . Instead , our data shows that also the T3 SAMase is a lyase and not a hydrolase , but future studies are needed to elucidate whether these enzymes also have additional mechanisms of anti-restriction activity ( Spoerel et al . , 1979 ) . Around the same time as the SAM-degrading enzyme from bacteriophage T3 was discovered , the same enzymatic activity was also found in extract from bacteria ( Shapiro and Mather , 1958 ) and yeast ( Mudd , 1959a; Mudd , 1959b ) . In both of these systems , the reaction products were described as MTA and \u03b3-aminobutyro-lactone ( homoserine lactone ) , and the conversion to homoserine was considered to be spontaneous . In contrast , the phage enzyme from T3 was early described as a SAM hydrolase , and referred to as such until this day . In the early literature , homoserine lactone was identified as an intermediate ( Gold et al . , 1964 ) but , perhaps due to the available methods at the time , it was not realized that homoserine was formed on a different time-scale from MTA , indicating a spontaneous and not enzyme-catalyzed reaction . For this reason , it is not until now that we can correct the functional annotation to SAM lyase . The SAM lyases show very low sequence conservation and large variations in size ( Figure 5 ) , and future studies will elucidate the relationship between structure and activity in this family of enzymes , their prevalence , and their exact biological roles in different organisms . \n For expression of an N-terminally truncated construct of Svi3-3 , the svi3-3 gene was PCR amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase with primers Svi3-3_d19f and Svi3-3_r1 and cloned into the pEXP5-NT/TOPO vector ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer's protocol . Transformants were selected on LA plates supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin . The correctness of plasmid pEXP5-Svi3-3_d19 was confirmed by sequencing ( Eurofins ) . The resulting plasmid encoded amino acid 20\u2013162 of the original His-tagged Svi3-3 polypeptide ( corresponding to residues 5\u2013147 from the phage-encoded sequence ) fused to an N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a TEV cleavage site . The sequence is numbered starting at the N terminus of the TEV-cleaved protein sequence , corresponding to an offset of \u221216 in relation to previous work ( Jerlstr\u00f6m Hultqvist et al . , 2018 ) . Svi3-3-d19 mutants Y58F , E69Q , E69A , and E105Q were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pEXP5-Svi3-3_d19 using the QuickChange II protocol ( Stratagene ) using the primers listed in Supplementary file 1-table 3 . Mutations in the plasmids pEXP5-Svi3-3_d19_Y58F , pEXP5-Svi3-3_d19_E69Q , pEXP5-Svi3-3_d19_E69A , and pEXP5-Svi3-3_d19_E105Q were confirmed by DNA sequencing . Expression plasmids were transformed into BL21-AI cells and plated on LA plates containing 50 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 0 . 1% glucose . For protein expression , 5 ml overnight culture in LB containing 50 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 0 . 1% glucose was used to inoculate 800 ml LB medium with the same composition and incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking . When OD600 reached 0 . 9 , expression was induced with 0 . 2% L-arabinose and the culture was further incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 hr before harvest by centrifugation . The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A ( 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole , 5 mM BME ) including cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor ( Roche ) and subjected to lysis by sonication . After centrifugation at 30 , 000 \u00d7 g for 30 min , the supernatant lysate was clarified by filtration through a 0 . 45\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0syringe filter , loaded to a gravity column containing pre-equilibrated Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow ( GE Healthcare ) and incubated under slow rotation for 10 min at 4\u00b0C . The column was washed extensively with buffer A supplemented with 20 mM imidazole , and the His-tagged protein was eluted with buffer A containing 500 mM imidazole . Protein-containing fractions were loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 pg column equilibrated with buffer B ( 25 mM Tris-HCl , 150 mM NaCl , pH 8 . 0 ) . WT Svi3-3_d19 , E69Q , E69A , and E105Q mutants eluted as trimers , while the Y58F mutant eluted mainly as monomer . Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 2 mg/ml . To cleave off the His-tag , the protein was incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with a 1:10 molar ratio of TEVSH protease ( van den Berg et al . , 2006 ) . The cleavage reaction was passed through Ni-Sepharose before being loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 pg column equilibrated in buffer B . Peak fractions were concentrated to 10 mg/ml for further use . T3 SAMase was produced by in vitro transcription\u2013translation as previously described ( Jerlstr\u00f6m Hultqvist et al . , 2018 ) . Crystallization was done using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature ( 293 K ) . Crystals grew in 2\u201310 days in drops containing 1 \u03bcl Svi3-3_d19 ( 10 mg/ml , with or without 5 mM SAH/SAM ) and 1 \u03bcl of reservoir solution containing 0 . 4\u20130 . 6 M ammonium phosphate . Crystals were cryo-protected in reservoir solution supplemented with 1 . 5 M proline and vitrified in liquid nitrogen for data collection . All data were collected at ESRF beamline ID23-1 at 100\u00a0K and processed with XDS ( Kabsch , 2010 ) . The Svi3-3_d19 structure with SAM was solved with ab initio methods using Arcimboldo_lite ( Rodr\u00edguez et al . , 2009 ) run on the National Supercomputer Center ( NSC ) in Link\u00f6ping and a 15 amino acid helix as search model ( McCoy et al . , 2007 ) . The structure was manually rebuilt in Coot ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) and refined using phenix . refine ( Afonine et al . , 2012 ) . Statistics for data collection and refinement are summarized in Table 1 . All structure figures were prepared using PyMol ( Schr\u00f6dinger LLC , 2020 ) . SEC-SAXS data for Svi3-3_d19 samples were collected at the Diamond Light Source on beamline B21 . In-line SEC-SAXS was performed using an Agilent 1200 HPLC system connected Shodex KW403 column . Data were recorded on a Pilatus 2M detector with a fixed camera length of 4 . 014 m and 12 . 4 keV energy allowing the collection of the angular range q between 0 . 0038\u00a0and\u00a00 . 42 \u00c5\u22121 . His6-tagged Svi3-3_d19 samples at 10\u201313 mg/ml concentration with and without 5 mM SAM were loaded onto the size exclusion\u00a0chromatography ( SEC ) column previously equilibrated in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl . Initial\u00a0buffer\u00a0subtraction and data processing was performed using Sc\u00c5tter ( F\u00f6rster et al . , 2010 ) . Further data analysis was performed with Primus ( Konarev et al . , 2003 ) and SAXSMoW ( Piiadov et al . , 2019 ) . The activity of WT and mutant versions of the N-terminally truncated Svi3-3 construct was determined according to the previously published discontinuous assay ( Jerlstr\u00f6m Hultqvist et al . , 2018 ) , by separation of SAM and MTA using cation exchange chromatography . All experiments were conducted at 25\u00b0C and the enzyme concentration and duration of the experiment were adjusted to the level of activity , ranging from 50 to 500 nM enzyme and 10 min to 1 week incubation . The experiments were done in biological duplicates ( two separately purified batches of each protein ) and technical duplicates ( two independently pipetted and measured enzymatic reactions ) . The protocol was adopted from Niesen et al . , 2007 . Each 25 \u00b5l reaction consisted of 20 \u00b5M WT or mutant Svi3-3 in 25 mM HEPES ( 4\u20132-hydroxyethyl- 1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid ) , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 2 \u00b5l 50\u00d7 SYPRO orange dye and 0\u20132500 \u00b5M of SAM or SAH or 0\u2013600 \u00b5M dcSAM mix . Reactions were done in technical triplicates ( for dcSAM technical duplicates ) in a BioRad CFx connect real-time system and subjected to a temperature gradient from 15\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C with an increment of 0 . 2\u00b0C per 30 s . Structure-guided sequence alignment was performed with PROMALS3D ( Pei et al . , 2008 ) and manually edited . The sequence alignment figure was prepared using ESPript ( Gouet et al . , 2003 ) . The different gene variants encoding the WT and mutant T3 SAMase were inserted on the chromosome of an \u0394ilvA auxotrophic mutant of E . coli K-12 MG1655 by \u03bb-red recombineering as previously described ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000; Koskiniemi et al . , 2011 ) . Each of the variants was used to replace the araBAD operon , so that the expression for these was under the control of the pBAD , the native promoter for the araBAD operon . Briefly , the first step involved replacing the araBAD operon in an \u0394ilvA E . coli K-12 MG1655 strain by cat-sacB-yfp cassette . The cassette was PCR amplified using the primers araBAD_cat_sacB_F and araBAD_cat_sacB_R ( Supplementary file 1-table 3 ) . Native T3 SAMase and variants with mutations at E67Q and E68Q were PCR amplified using specific primers that contained homologies surrounding the araBAD operon at the 5\u2019 end followed by sequences that allowed amplification of the T3 SAMase variants from the respective plasmids ( ara_t3samF , ara_t3samR ) . PCR products were purified , DNA was transformed into the strain containing the cat-sacB-yfp cassette at the araBAD location , and transformants were selected on sucrose plates . Variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing ( using test_primer_F , test_primer_R , Supplementary file 1-table 3 ) . Two different approaches were used to determine if the different variants of Svi3-3 , Orf1 , and T3 SAMase could complement the \u0394ilvA auxotrophic mutant . In cases where the variant was present on a plasmid , the plasmid was transformed into the \u0394ilvA auxotrophic mutant and was selected on LA-ampicillin ( 50 \u03bcg/ml ) or LA-chloramphenicol ( 15 \u03bcg/ml ) plates . Svi-3\u20133 and Orf1 were both cloned on a high copy number plasmid pCA24N \u2013gfp , while T3 SAM hydrolase was cloned on an intermediate copy number plasmid pRD2 . In each case the genes were placed under the IPTG-inducible promoter PLlacO . The transformants were then re-streaked , and the re-streaked colonies were tested for growth on M9-Glucose ( 0 . 2% ) minimal media plates , with or without IPTG . On each test plate , the \u0394ilvA auxotrophic mutant containing the empty vector was used as a negative control . The same approach was used to test functionality of the T3 SAMase variants that were present on the chromosome , with induction being obtained using different concentrations of L-arabinose ( 0% , 0 . 01% , 0 . 05% , and 0 . 1% ) . E69A and E69Q variants were constructed for full-length Svi3-3 and Svi3-3_d19 to test for their ability to rescue the \u0394ilvA mutant ( Jerlstr\u00f6m Hultqvist et al . , 2018 ) . Synthetic genes ( Eurofins ) containing the desired mutations and Kpn1 and Xba1 cleavage sites were cleaved-out of the original vector and ligated into a modified version of the pCA24N plasmid , purified on a spin-column and transformed directly into the \u0394ilvA mutant . Plasmids were extracted from isolated colonies and sequenced to confirm the correct sequence . The respective clones were then checked for their ability to grow on minimal glucose plates . All in vivo complementation experiments were done in biological duplicates . MD simulations of the Svi3-3 trimer with and without SAM in the active sites were performed with Desmond ( Bowers et al . , 2006; Schr\u00f6dinger , 2018 ) using the OPLS3 force field ( Harder et al . , 2016; Jorgensen et al . , 1996; Jorgensen and Tirado-Rives , 1988; Shivakumar et al . , 2010 ) . The Svi3-3 crystal structure in complex with SAH was used as starting conformation for the simulations where missing hydrogens were automatically added using the protein preparation wizard tool in Maestro ( Sastry et al . , 2013 ) . The native substrate SAM was docked to the active site using Glide ( Friesner et al . , 2006; Friesner et al . , 2004; Halgren et al . , 2004; Schr\u00f6dinger , 2018 ) . The docking grid was generated with the OPLS3 force field centered on the SAH inhibitor bound to the active site of the Svi3-3 crystal structure . Due to an error in our library file , the force field parameters of the base were taken from tubercidin instead of adenine , but the charge distributions of these two bases are almost identical . The Maestro system builder ( Schr\u00f6dinger , n . d . ) was used to solvate the Svi3-3 trimer with TIP3P ( Jorgensen et al . , 1983 ) water molecules in an orthorhombic box with buffer distances of 10 \u00c5 to the boundary on all sides . The system was neutralized by addition of Na+ ions and the final simulation box consisted of 60 , 972 atoms . A total of 100 ns MD simulation at 298 K was run in the NPT ensemble using the reference system propagator algorithm ( RESPA ) time stepping scheme ( Tuckerman et al . , 1991 ) with time steps of 2 fs for bonded terms , 2 fs for van der Waals and short-range electrostatic interactions , and 6 fs for long-range electrostatic interactions . Short-range Coulomb interactions were treated with a cuto\ufb00 radius of 9 \u00c5 . Long-range interactions were treated with the smooth Particle Mesh Ewald method ( Darden et al . , 1993 ) with a tolerance of 10\u20139 . The NPT ensemble was calculated with the Nose-Hoover chain thermostat method ( Hoover , 1985; Nos\u00e9 , 1984 ) , using a relaxation time of 1 ps , and the Martyna-Tobias-Klein barostat method ( Martyna et al . , 1994 ) , using isotropic coupling with a relaxation time of 2 ps . The catalytic mechanism of\u00a0Svi3-3 was investigated with DFT calculations . A cluster model ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B ) was generated from a snapshot of the equilibrated Svi3-3 X-ray structure taken from the MD simulation described above ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . This snapshot is a typical representative displaying the key interactions shown in Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 . The active site model was composed of the backbone atoms of Val17 , Gly18 , Leu19 , Asn20 , and Val21 chopped at the N and C\u00a0termini , Tyr58 and Glu69 chopped at the CA position , and Gln104 , Glu105 , and Ser106 ( with backbone ) chopped at the N and C-termini . A smaller substrate mimicking SAM was used for the DFT calculations . Here , adenosine was deleted from SAM , resulting in 2-ammonio-4- ( ( R ) -ethyl ( methyl ) sulfonio ) butanoate , or S-ethylmethionine ( SEM ) . In addition , a total of six water molecules from the MD snapshot were included in the cluster model , which includes the first two solvation shells of the reaction center . To account for the steric effect of the surrounding parts of the protein , atoms in the chopped positions were kept fixed to their original positions ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The final model after addition of methyl groups to the chopped protein positions consisted of 194 atoms ( 716 electrons ) . In general , cluster models comprising\u00a0~200 atoms have been found to be sufficiently reliable for mechanistic investigations , provided they include all key protein residues involved in the reaction , and have also been shown to be relatively insensitive to dielectric effects ( Siegbahn and Himo , 2009 ) . However , as noted above , ion-pair configurations with charge separation over a large distance may be disfavored , and we thus also recalculated the reaction energetics with the system constrained to the standard protonation state of Tyr58 and Glu105 , which was also the initial configuration for the optimization . All DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 ( Frisch et al . , 2009 ) package . Geometry optimizations and frequency calculations were computed with the B3LYP functional ( Becke , 1993 ) and the 6-31G ( d , p ) basis set . Dispersion effects were included in all calculations using Grimme\u2019s B3LYP-D3 method ( Grimme et al . , 2011; Grimme et al . , 2010 ) . Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were performed in both directions from the transition state to verify that the correct minima are connected . Solvent effects were obtained by single-point calculations on the optimized stationary points with the solvent model based on density ( SMD ) ( Marenich et al . , 2009 ) . Electronic energies were calculated from single-point calculations on the optimized geometries ( RS , TS , and PS ) at the b3lyp/6-311G+ ( 2d , 2p ) level of theory . The final reported energies are the electronic energies with the large basis set corrected for zero-point energies ( ZPE ) and solvent effects in kcal/mol . E . coli K-12 MG1655 pCA24N:speD from the ASKA library ( Kitagawa et al . , 2005 ) encoding the hexahistidine tagged SAM decarboxylase ( SDC ) enzyme were inoculated in LB containing 34 \u00b5g/ml chloramphenicol . Five\u00a0milliliters of saturated culture was used to inoculate 800 ml LB medium with the same composition and incubated at 37\u00b0C until OD600 reached 0 . 6 . Expression was induced with 0 . 5 mM IPTG and the culture was incubated overnight at 20\u00b0C . The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C . The pellet was washed in 25 mM Tris pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl , and pelleted again at 8\u00b0C . The cells were resuspended in buffer A ( 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 , 300 mM NaCl , 10 mM MgSO4 , 5 mM BME ) including cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor ( Roche ) and subjected to lysis by sonication . After centrifugation at 30 , 000 \u00d7 g for 30 min , the supernatant was clarified by filtration through a 0 . 45-\u00b5m-syringe filter , loaded in a gravity column containing 2 ml of pre-equilibrated Ni-sepharose ( GE Healthcare ) , and incubated under slow rotation for 30 min at 8\u00b0C . The column was washed extensively with buffer A supplemented with 20 mM imidazole , and the His-tagged protein was eluted with buffer A containing 500 mM imidazole . Protein-containing fractions were loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column previously equilibrated with buffer B ( 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM MgSO4 , 5 mM BME ) . Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 5 mg/ml . 0 . 5 or 2 mM SAM was incubated with 20 \u00b5M SDC for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C in reaction buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 , 50 mM KCl , 10 mM MgSO4 ) . After the incubation , 40 \u00b5l of the reaction was quenched with the same volume of quenching buffer ( 50 mM citrate pH 2 . 6 ) . The rest of the reaction was filtered through a 3 kDa cutoff concentrator to remove the enzyme . The flow-through was collected and the concentration dcSAM + SAM + MTA was determined by the absorbance at 260 nm to 0 . 32 mM and 1 . 1 mM . The fraction of dcSAM was determined using ion exchange chromatography to 77% in the lower-concentration reaction\u00a0and 72% in the higher-concentration\u00a0reaction . 0 . 32 mM dcSAM mix ( 77% dcSAM ) was incubated with 0 . 1 \u00b5M Svi3-3 in reaction buffer at 37\u00b0C . As a control , dcSAM without Svi3-3 was incubated for the same time . SAM ( 0 . 32 mM ) was incubated with 0 . 1 \u00b5M Svi3-3 and as a control only SAM ( 0 . 32 mM ) was incubated for the same period of time . Samples of 40 \u00b5l were quenched with the same volume of quenching buffer after 0 . 5 and 23 hr . Samples were analyzed with the same cation exchange method as for the standard activity assay ( Jerlstr\u00f6m Hultqvist et al . , 2018 ) but using a linear buffer gradient over seven column volumes . For TLC experiments , reactions containing 2 mM SAM and 0 . 20 \u03bcM Svi3-3 , 0 . 20 \u03bcM Orf1 , or 0 . 25 \u03bcM T3 SAMase in 50 mM NaPi pH 7 . 4 were incubated for\u00a020 min at 25\u00b0C . MTA product formation of\u00a0>70% was verified using ion exchange chromatography . 5 \u00d7 2 \u03bcl reaction was loaded on a TLC Silica gel 60 F254 plate and developed using a mobile phase of 55% n-butanol , 30% H2O , 15% acetic acid . The plate was treated with BME followed by ninhydrin staining ( Basak et al . , 2005 ) . Briefly , the dried plate was sprayed with 1% BME in acetone , heated with a hair dryer , sprayed with 0 . 25% ninhydrin in acetone , and heated again until spots were clearly visible . To analyze\u00a0the reaction products by NMR spectroscopy , a 700 \u03bcl reaction mixture was prepared containing 4 mM SAM and 500 nM Svi3-3 d19 in 100 mM Na phosphate buffer pH 7 . 4% and 90% D2O . The pH of the sample was adjusted to 7 . 4 after addition of SAM with 5M NaOH . The reaction was incubated for 20 min at 25\u00b0C and shock-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until measurement . Turnover of\u00a0>90% of substrate was verified by ion exchange chromatography . 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 600 . 18 MHz on a Bruker Avance Neo spectrometer equipped with a TCI ( CRPHe TR-1H and 19F/13C/15N 5mm-EZ ) cryogenic probe for samples in aqueous sodium phosphate buffer ( NaPi , 100 mM , pH 7 . 4 , solvent D2O ) at 25\u00b0C . Typically 64\u2013128 scans were accumulated with a relaxation delay of 0 . 7 s and an acquisition time of 2 . 75 s , using the zg30 pulse sequence . Spectra were obtained by zero filling the recorded 32 k data points to 128 k , followed by multiplication with an exponential weighting function and Fourier transformation . The formation of homoserine lactone in the enzymatic reaction was confirmed by comparison with the 1H NMR spectrum of an authentic sample ( from Sigma ) dissolved in the same buffer , and by comparison with literature data ( Helms et al . , 1988 ) . Homoserine lactone spectra were also recorded for various concentrations ( 70 mM , 17 . 5 mM , 4 . 4 mM , 1 . 1 mM , and\u00a00 . 3 mM ) and for various times after sample preparation ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . The spectra indicated a gradual hydrolysis of the lactone to homoserine that was identified by comparison with literature 1H NMR data ( Jamieson et al . , 2009 ) and an authentic homoserine sample ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2 ) ."}

The immune system makes antiviral proteins , called restriction factors , which can stop the virus from replicating . In response , viruses evolve to evade the effects of restriction factors . To counter this , restriction factors evolve too , and the cycle continues . The challenge for the immune system is that mammals do not evolve as fast as viruses . How then , in the face of this disadvantage , can the immune system hope to keep pace with viral evolution ? One human antiviral protein that seems to have struggled to keep up is TRIM5\u03b1 . In rhesus macaques , it is very effective at stopping the replication of HIV-1 and related viruses . But in humans , it is not effective at all . But why ? Protein evolution happens due to small genetic mutations , but not every mutation makes a protein better . If a protein is resilient , it can tolerate lots of neutral or negative mutations without breaking , until it mutates in a way that makes it better . But , if a protein is fragile , even small changes can render it completely unable to do its job . It is possible that restriction factors , like TRIM5\u03b1 , are evolutionarily 'fragile' , and therefore easy to break . But it is difficult to test whether this is the case , because existing mutations have already passed the test of natural selection . This means that either the mutation is somehow useful for the protein , or that it is not harmful enough to be removed . Tenthorey et al . devised a way to introduce all possible changes to the part of TRIM5\u03b1 that binds to viruses . This revealed that TRIM5\u03b1 is not fragile; most random mutations increased , rather than decreased , the protein\u2019s ability to prevent viral infection . In fact , it appears it would only take a single mutation to make TRIM5\u03b1 better at blocking HIV-1 in humans , and there are many possible single mutations that would work . Thus , it would appear that human TRIM5\u03b1 can easily gain the ability to block HIV-1 . The next step was to find out whether these gains in antiviral activity are just as easily lost . To do this , Tenthorey et al . performed the same tests on TRIM5\u03b1 from rhesus macaques and an HIV-blocking mutant version of human TRIM5\u03b1 . This showed that the majority of random mutations do not break TRIM5\u03b1\u2019s virus-blocking ability . Thus , TRIM5\u03b1 can readily gain antiviral activity and , once gained , does not lose it easily during subsequent mutation . Antiviral proteins like TRIM5\u03b1 engage in uneven evolutionary battles with fast-evolving viruses . But , although they are resilient and able to evolve , they are not always able to find the right mutations on their own . Experiments like these suggest that it might be possible to give them a helping hand . Identifying mutations that help human TRIM5\u03b1 to strongly block HIV-1 could pave the way for future gene therapy . This step would demand significant advances in gene therapy efficacy and safety , but it could offer a new way to block virus infection in the future .", "source": "Host antiviral proteins engage in evolutionary arms races with viruses , in which both sides rapidly evolve at interaction interfaces to gain or evade immune defense . For example , primate TRIM5\u03b1 uses its rapidly evolving \u2018v1\u2019 loop to bind retroviral capsids , and single mutations in this loop can dramatically improve retroviral restriction . However , it is unknown whether such gains of viral restriction are rare , or if they incur loss of pre-existing function against other viruses . Using deep mutational scanning , we comprehensively measured how single mutations in the TRIM5\u03b1 v1 loop affect restriction of divergent retroviruses . Unexpectedly , we found that the majority of mutations increase weak antiviral function . Moreover , most random mutations do not disrupt potent viral restriction , even when it is newly acquired via a single adaptive substitution . Our results indicate that TRIM5\u03b1\u2019s adaptive landscape is remarkably broad and mutationally resilient , maximizing its chances of success in evolutionary arms races with retroviruses . \n Mammalian genomes combat the persistent threat of viruses by encoding a battery of cell-intrinsic antiviral proteins , termed restriction factors , that recognize and inhibit viral replication within host cells . The potency of restriction factors places selective pressure on viruses to evade recognition in order to complete replication ( Duggal and Emerman , 2012 ) . In turn , viral escape spurs adaptation of restriction factors , by selecting for variants that re-establish viral recognition and thereby restriction ( McCarthy et al . , 2015 ) . Mutual antagonism between viruses and their hosts thus drives cycles of recurrent adaptation , in prey-predator-like genetic arms races ( Van Valen , 1973 ) . These arms races result in the rapid evolution of restriction factors , which accumulate amino acid mutations at their virus-binding interfaces at a higher than expected rate ( Daugherty and Malik , 2012 ) . Numerous restriction factors , including TRIM5\u03b1 ( Sawyer et al . , 2005 ) , APOBEC3G ( Sawyer et al . , 2004 ) , and MxA ( Mitchell et al . , 2012 ) , evolve rapidly as a result of arms races with target viruses . The resulting divergence between restriction factor orthologs can result in cross-species barriers to viral infection ( Compton and Emerman , 2013; Kirmaier et al . , 2010 ) . Such barriers led to the initial identification of TRIM5\u03b1 , during a screen for proteins that prevented HIV-1 ( human immunodeficiency virus ) from efficiently replicating in rhesus macaque cells ( Stremlau et al . , 2004 ) . Rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 could potently restrict HIV-1 , whereas the virus almost completely escapes TRIM5\u03b1-mediated inhibition in its human host . Subsequent studies revealed that restriction of SIVs ( simian immunodeficiency viruses ) also varies across TRIM5\u03b1 orthologs and that SIVs likely drove the rapid evolution of TRIM5\u03b1 in Old World monkeys ( McCarthy et al . , 2015; Wu et al . , 2013 ) . TRIM5\u03b1 disrupts retroviral replication early in infection by binding to the capsid core of retroviruses entering the cell ( Li et al . , 2016; Maillard et al . , 2007; Owens et al . , 2003 ) . Its binding causes the premature uncoating of the viral core ( Stremlau et al . , 2006 ) , preventing delivery of the viral genome to the nucleus for integration . TRIM5\u03b1 binds to the capsid via the unstructured v1 loop within its B30 . 2 domain ( Biris et al . , 2012; Sebastian and Luban , 2005 ) . Experiments swapping the v1 loop between TRIM5\u03b1 orthologs indicated that it is critical for recognition of capsid from many retroviruses ( Ohkura et al . , 2006; Perron et al . , 2006; Sawyer et al . , 2005 ) . In Old World monkeys and hominoids , rapid evolution of TRIM5\u03b1 is concentrated within this v1 loop ( Sawyer et al . , 2005;\u00a0Figure 1A ) . Single amino acid mutations at these rapidly evolving sites can cause dramatic gains of restriction against HIV-1 and other retroviruses ( Li et al . , 2006; Maillard et al . , 2007; Yap et al . , 2005 ) . However , it remains unclear whether such adaptive mutations are rare among all single mutational steps that might be randomly sampled during TRIM5\u03b1\u2019s natural evolution . The functional consequence of all single mutations from a given protein sequence can be visualized as an evolutionary landscape ( Smith , 1970 ) , in which mutations are either beneficial ( fitness peak ) , detrimental ( fitness valley ) , or neutral . The topology of this evolutionary landscape , in terms of numbers of peaks and valleys and their connections , represents the adaptive potential of restriction factors in their evolutionary arms race with viruses . Previous studies that have empirically mapped evolutionary landscapes of conserved enzymes and transcription factors revealed that ligand-binding residues are highly intolerant to substitutions ( Fowler et al . , 2010; Guo et al . , 2004; McLaughlin et al . , 2012; Suckow et al . , 1996 ) . Moreover , mutations that allowed proteins to gain novel ligand specificity , even for closely related ligands , were rare among all possible substitutions ( McLaughlin et al . , 2012; Starr et al . , 2017; Stiffler et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , TRIM5\u03b1 and other restriction factors can dramatically change antiviral potency via single mutations at viral interaction interfaces ( Daugherty and Malik , 2012; Mitchell et al . , 2012 ) . However , since the frequency of such gain-of-function mutations is unknown , it is unclear whether virus-binding surfaces in rapidly evolving antiviral factors are subject to the same evolutionary constraints as previously mapped for other proteins . Here , we investigated the adaptive landscape of antiviral specificity conferred by the rapidly evolving , capsid-binding v1 loop of TRIM5\u03b1 . To our surprise , we found that , rather than the evolutionary landscape of TRIM5\u03b1 being narrowly constrained among all possible amino acid substitutions , the majority of random mutations in the v1 loop resulted in gains of antiviral restriction . We found that the primary v1 loop determinant for TRIM5\u03b1\u2019s restriction of HIV-1 and other lentiviruses is its net electrostatic charge . Furthermore , both rhesus and human TRIM5\u03b1 proteins are highly resilient to mutation , in that they withstand more than half of all possible single amino acid mutations in the v1 loop without compromising their antiviral restriction abilities . This unexpectedly permissive landscape allows TRIM5\u03b1 to sample a wide variety of mutations to maximize its chances of success in arms races with retroviruses . \n Despite their rapid evolution , primate TRIM5\u03b1 orthologs have sampled relatively limited amino acid diversity at rapidly evolving positions within the capsid-binding v1 loop ( Figure 1A ) . For example , although single amino acid changes at residue 332 are responsible for dramatic differences in antiviral restriction ( Li et al . , 2006 ) , this residue repeatedly toggles between just three amino acids . The limited diversity is not due to evolutionary inaccessibility , since most amino acids that can be sampled with single nucleotide changes are not observed among primate TRIM5\u03b1 orthologs ( Figure 1B ) . There are two alternative explanations for this restricted diversity . First , it might suggest that adaptive gain-of-function mutations in TRIM5\u03b1 are rare , with TRIM5\u03b1\u2019s evolutionary landscape mainly consisting of fitness valleys with only a few mutational avenues to reach fitness peaks ( Figure 1C ) . Conversely , the limited diversity might be a consequence of epistatic interactions with other sites that constrain amino acid sampling , or even simple chance . Under this scenario , TRIM5\u03b1\u2019s evolutionary landscape may consist of numerous , wide peaks that tolerate substantial mutational variation ( Figure 1D ) . We sought to differentiate between these possibilities by experimentally defining the evolutionary landscape of antiviral restriction over all possible single mutational steps in the v1 loop of both human and rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 . We took a deep mutational scanning ( DMS ) approach ( Fowler et al . , 2010 ) to measure the effect on antiviral restriction of all v1 loop single mutations in a pooled assay . We first generated a library of all single amino acid variants ( including stop codons ) within the rapidly evolving portion of the v1 loop ( amino acids 330 to 340 , Figure 1A ) , with a library diversity of 231 amino acid ( 352 nucleotide ) variants ( Figure 2A ) . The resulting TRIM5\u03b1 variants were stably expressed via transduction into CRFK ( cat renal fibroblast ) cells , which naturally lack TRIM5\u03b1 ( McEwan et al . , 2009 ) . We transduced CRFK cells at a low dose to limit the integration of multiple variants into individual cells , thus generating a pool of cells each expressing a single TRIM5\u03b1 point mutant . Libraries were represented with at least 500-fold coverage through all experimental steps to avoid bottlenecking library diversity . Human TRIM5\u03b1 only weakly restricts HIV-1 ( Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al . , 2019; OhAinle et al . , 2018 ) . However , single amino acid mutations in the v1 loop can substantially increase restriction activity ( Li et al . , 2006; Pham et al . , 2010; Pham et al . , 2013 ) . To comprehensively assess how many single mutation variants of human TRIM5\u03b1 had increased activity against HIV-1 , we first performed a gain-of-function screen . We challenged the library of human TRIM5\u03b1 variant-expressing cells with HIV-1 bearing a GFP reporter , at a dose infecting 98% of cells ( Figure 2B ) . Because GFP expression becomes detectable only after integration of the HIV-1 proviral genome , cells expressing TRIM5\u03b1 variants that restrict HIV-1 infection remain GFP-negative . However , ~2% of cells that were uninfected by chance would also be GFP-negative . Therefore , to enrich for cells expressing bona fide restrictive TRIM5\u03b1 variants , we sorted the GFP-negative cells from the first round of infection and subjected them to a second round of HIV-1-GFP infection and sorting . Following this second round of selection , we deep sequenced the TRIM5\u03b1 variants in the GFP-negative cell population . We normalized the count of each variant to its representation in the pre-selection cell population to determine its enrichment score , which should reflect the relative antiviral function of each TRIM5\u03b1 variant . Enrichment scores were highly correlated between two independent biological replicates ( Figure 2C , Spearman r\u00a0=\u00a00 . 97 ) . Furthermore , mutants bearing premature stop codons , which should be non-functional and depleted from the restrictor pool , were all among the most depleted variants ( Figure 2D , red ) . Despite the weak ( ~2 fold ) restriction of HIV-1 by wildtype ( WT ) human TRIM5\u03b1 , variants containing synonymous nucleotide changes ( no amino acid changes compared to WT , blue ) had significantly higher enrichment scores than those containing stop codons ( p<0 . 0001 , student\u2019s unpaired t-test with Welch\u2019s correction ) , confirming that the assay worked as expected . To investigate whether enrichment scores were truly representative of increased antiviral function , and to validate some of the novel amino acid changes that appeared to result in increased restriction , we made 16 targeted missense mutants from across the enrichment spectrum and challenged them individually with HIV-1-GFP . We determined their fold-restriction by determining the relative viral dose required to infect 10% of cells ( ID10 ) expressing a TRIM5\u03b1 variant compared to an empty vector control; a larger viral dose is required to overcome TRIM5\u03b1-mediated restriction ( Figure 2E ) . We confirmed that several previously described gain-of-function variants ( Li et al . , 2006; Pham et al . , 2010; Pham et al . , 2013 ) had increased antiviral activity and were highly enriched ( Figure 2F: G330E , R332P , R332E , R335E ) . Moreover , we identified novel amino acid mutations that significantly increased antiviral activity , such as R335A and G333D , whereas moderately enriched variants ( e . g . G333Y , Q337N ) had correspondingly modest gains in HIV-1 restriction . Indeed , enrichment scores and fold-restriction were highly correlated across all mutants tested ( Spearman r\u00a0=\u00a00 . 90 ) . Thus , enrichment scores accurately reflect antiviral activity , validating our approach to simultaneously identify all single mutants with increased HIV-1 restriction . Therefore , in subsequent analyses , we use enrichment scores as a proxy for the antiviral restriction activity of TRIM5\u03b1 mutants . Based on the limited amino acid diversity among primate TRIM5\u03b1 v1 loops ( Figure 1A\u2013B ) , we expected that our DMS assay would reveal only a few beneficial mutations that improve human TRIM5\u03b1 restriction of HIV-1 . Contrary to this expectation , we found that more than half of all missense variants ( 115 , 57% ) had enrichment scores that fell more than two standard deviations above WT TRIM5\u03b1 ( Figure 2D ) . Even if we limited our analysis to amino acid variants that are evolutionarily accessible via single-nucleotide changes from the WT TRIM5\u03b1 sequence , this ratio did not change substantially ( 32 , 54% ) . These enrichment scores represent dramatic gains in HIV-1 restriction , with the most potent variants ( R332P and R335A ) improving HIV-1 restriction\u00a0~15 fold relative to WT ( 33- and 39-fold restriction , respectively ) . Our findings indicate that the fitness landscape of the v1 loop is not narrowly constrained , but rather is remarkably permissive ( Figure 1D ) , in that most single amino acid changes not seen in natural sequences enhance the ability of human TRIM5\u03b1 to restrict HIV-1 . Thus , TRIM5\u03b1 has the capacity to readily evolve antiviral potency against HIV-1 via single mutations . We analyzed whether a common biochemical mechanism could explain the unexpectedly high fraction of restrictive TRIM5\u03b1 variants . We found that increased expression levels could explain some of the improvement in HIV-1 restriction , although several mutations ( G333D , G333Y ) improved restriction without increasing expression ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B ) . In contrast , most gains in HIV-1 restriction could be completely accounted for by a reduction in the electrostatic charge of the v1 loop ( Figure 3A ) , regardless of expression level . Indeed , reducing the electrostatic charge always improved HIV-1 restriction , but did not always increase TRIM5\u03b1 expression level ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D ) . Among all variants tested , mutation of the positively-charged residues 332 or 335 from the WT arginine ( R ) to any amino acid except lysine ( K ) significantly improved HIV-1 restriction ( Figure 3A\u2013B ) , consistent with previous reports on R332 variants ( Li et al . , 2006 ) . Mutation of uncharged sites to K or R decreased TRIM5\u03b1 restriction of HIV-1 , whereas introducing a negatively\u00a0charged aspartic acid ( D ) or glutamic acid ( E ) significantly increased HIV-1 restriction ( Figure 3C ) . Since our DMS assay tests only one mutation at a time , all mutations to D or E occur in the context of at least one proximal positively\u00a0charged residue . Therefore , we infer that the position-independent benefit of introducing D or E derives from offsetting pre-existing positive charge in the v1 loop that is detrimental to HIV-1 restriction . Indeed , reducing the net charge of the v1 loop explains all the highest enrichment scores ( Figure 3D ) . Thus , we conclude that positive charge in the v1 loop is the dominant impediment to HIV-1 restriction by human TRIM5\u03b1 . Removal of positive charge , however , could not explain all of the improved HIV-1 restriction we observed . For example , despite its strict conservation in primate TRIM5\u03b1 ( Figure 1A ) , a glycine ( G ) at residue 333 compromises HIV-1 restriction . Mutation of G333 to most other amino acids significantly improves TRIM5\u03b1 activity ( Figure 3B ) . We confirmed this finding for several individual variants ( Figure 2F: G333Y , G333D ) . We found a similar pattern for residue F339 , which is disfavored for HIV-1 restriction , albeit not to the same extent as G333 . Contrary to our initial expectations , there is only a weak association between rapidly evolving residues and residues whose mutation can significantly improve HIV-1 restriction: missense mutations in three of six rapidly evolving sites , versus one of five conserved sites , significantly improve HIV-1 restriction ( Figure 3B ) . This result suggests that conserved positions in the vicinity of rapidly evolving sites possess unexpected potential to improve antiviral potency . We also tested whether beneficial mutations might have additive effects on HIV-1 restriction by human TRIM5\u03b1 . We combined several gain-of-function variants with the R332P mutation , previously described to potently restrict HIV-1 ( Yap et al . , 2005 ) . However , we found that no double mutants tested increased HIV-1 restriction beyond that of R332P alone ( Figure 3E ) . Instead , combination of one gain-of-function variant ( R335E ) with R332P resulted in loss of protein expression and HIV-1 restriction . Previous reports also found that most beneficial mutations are either non-additive or interfering , identifying only one combination ( R332G with R335G ) that was partially additive ( Li et al . , 2006; Pham et al . , 2010; Pham et al . , 2013 ) . Given that R332P is one of the strongest gain-of-function variants we identified , it remains possible that other , more modest gain-of-function variants might additively improve HIV-1 restriction . Nevertheless , these results suggest that single gain-of-function mutations , such as R332P , can confer most or all the increased HIV-1 restriction potential onto human TRIM5\u03b1 . Thus , remarkably , human TRIM5\u03b1 appears to be located only one mutational step away from fitness peaks in its evolutionary landscape of potential adaptation against HIV-1 . Finally , we investigated whether gain-of-function mutations for HIV-1 restriction also conferred protection against other lentiviruses . We focused on lentiviruses whose\u00a0restriction\u00a0is v1 loop-dependent: either the entire v1 loop ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) or the R332P mutation from rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 ( Stremlau et al . , 2005 ) could confer human TRIM5\u03b1 with substantial antiviral function . In each case , WT human TRIM5\u03b1 only weakly restricts these lentiviruses ( Figure 4A ) . However , the charge-altering mutations R332P and R335A increased restriction of all lentiviruses we tested , including HIV-2 , SIVcpz ( SIV infecting chimpanzees ) , and SIVmac ( SIV infecting rhesus macaques ) . Introduction of negative charge ( R332E , R335E , G330E , G333D , and G337D ) also selectively improved restriction of HIV-1 , SIVcpz , and HIV-2 but not SIVmac . Thus , positive charge at positions 332 and 335 appears to be generally detrimental for lentiviral restriction . Furthermore , although TRIM5\u03b1 fitness landscapes are lentivirus-specific , many of the mutations we tested increased restriction against other lentiviruses . These data suggest that the evolutionary landscape for lentiviral restriction by TRIM5\u03b1 is likely to be generally permissive , as it is for HIV-1 . Our data show that novel antiviral potency is readily attainable by single amino acid changes in human TRIM5\u03b1 ( Figures 2D and 4A ) . However , these gains might be just as easily lost through further mutation , since rapidly evolving antiviral proteins like TRIM5\u03b1 continually adapt in their arms race with viruses . Therefore , in order to test whether newly acquired antiviral potency is fragile or resistant to mutation , we investigated the mutational resilience of the R332P variant of human TRIM5\u03b1 , which inhibits HIV-1\u00a0~15 fold more than WT ( Figure 2F ) . To do so , we generated a v1 DMS library of human TRIM5\u03b1 with R332P fixed in all variants . We challenged this pooled cell library with HIV-1-GFP , at a viral titer which human TRIM5\u03b1-R332P restricts to\u00a0~1% infection . In this case , we sorted and deep sequenced GFP-positive cells , so that enrichment ( relative to initial representation ) now reflects the degree to which each TRIM5\u03b1-R332P variant lost its antiviral function against HIV-1 ( Figure 4B ) . As expected , we observed strong enrichment of stop codons in the non-restrictor pool and good correlation between biological replicates ( Figure 4C ) . Addition of positive charge by mutations to K or R at most positions in the v1 loop reduced HIV-1 restriction ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B ) . This preference against positive charge mirrors that of WT human TRIM5\u03b1 , for which removal of positive charge increased HIV-1 restriction ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . However , we found no other consistent biochemical constraints for HIV-1 restriction by TRIM5\u03b1-R332P ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B ) . Indeed , we found that the majority of missense variants ( 65% ) did not weaken HIV-1 restriction by the R332P variant of human TRIM5\u03b1 ( Figure 4C ) . Thus , WT human TRIM5\u03b1 is only one mutational step away from a fitness peak ( Figure 3 ) that , once achieved , also exhibits a surprising degree of resilience to mutation . This implies that gains of restriction by TRIM5\u03b1 are not likely to be compromised by its continued adaptation . To determine if HIV-1 restriction is also resilient to mutation in a naturally\u00a0occurring TRIM5\u03b1 variant , we next assessed the likelihood that random mutations disrupt viral restriction by WT rhesus macaque TRIM5\u03b1 , which strongly restricts HIV-1 in a manner that strictly requires the v1 loop ( Sawyer et al . , 2005 ) . Like with human TRIM5\u03b1 , we constructed a library of cells each expressing a single rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 variant , with each variant containing a single mutation in the v1 loop ( note that the v1 loop is slightly longer in macaques compared to humans , Figure 1A ) . We then challenged this pool of cells with HIV-1-GFP and sorted GFP-positive cells for subsequent deep sequencing . Rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 variants containing premature stop codons were strongly enriched in the non-restrictor pool , whereas WT variants were significantly depleted ( Figure 5A ) . In contrast , half of all missense mutations ( 125 , 51% ) fell within two standard deviations of WT . Even missense mutations accessible by single-nucleotide changes reflected this pattern ( 40 , 55% ) . By re-testing individual variants , we confirmed that enrichment scores negatively correlate with antiviral potency ( Figure 5B ) . We tested seven variants enriched for loss-of-restriction ( more than two standard deviations above WT ) and found that six lost HIV-1 restriction . The seventh variant ( L337N ) was only slightly outside the two standard-deviation cut-off for enrichment and correspondingly only slightly worse than WT in terms of HIV-1 inhibition . Thus , enrichment in the non-restrictor pool represents bona fide loss of restriction . All the rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 variants we report here represent novel loss-of-function mutations . Their loss of HIV-1 restriction cannot be explained by loss of expression or protein stability ( Figure 5C ) . For example , the F340D , P341I , and P341G variants were all expressed at WT levels but lost HIV-1 restriction . Moreover , the T344E variant retained restriction despite reduced expression levels . We also re-tested ten rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 variants not significantly enriched for loss-of-restriction ( Figure 5B ) . Two variants ( P334M , G335I ) enriched one standard deviation above WT correspondingly retained only partial HIV-1 restriction relative to WT rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 . The eight remaining variants retained HIV-1 inhibition , consistent with their lack of enrichment relative to WT . Based on this validation , we conclude that roughly half of all v1 loop single point mutations do not significantly reduce HIV-1 restriction by rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 . Thus , a natural rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 antiviral variant , much like the human TRIM5\u03b1-R332P variant , displays considerable mutational resilience . We expected that conserved residues should be less tolerant of changes than rapidly evolving sites . However , we found that mutations in only three of seven conserved sites , versus two of six rapidly evolving sites , led to significant loss of function ( Figure 5D ) . Collectively , these results indicate that rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 restriction of HIV-1 is highly robust to changes within the critical v1 loop at both rapidly evolving and conserved sites . The biochemical preferences for HIV-1 restriction are similar but not identical between rhesus and human TRIM5\u03b1 . In both cases , the introduction of positive charge , particularly R , weakened HIV-1 inhibition ( Figure 5D , compare to Figure 3C ) . In contrast , the introduction of bulky hydrophobic residues , including leucine ( L ) , phenylalanine ( F ) , and tryptophan ( W ) , significantly impaired HIV-1 restriction by rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 but did not affect the potency of human TRIM5\u03b1 . These data suggest that both universal as well as lineage-specific requirements for the v1 loop shape TRIM5\u03b1 restriction of HIV-1 . Our findings with TRIM5\u03b1 restriction of HIV-1 suggest that single mutations can readily achieve gain-of-function . In contrast , loss-of-function mutations are not so abundant as to make adaptation unlikely . Thus , the evolutionary landscape of TRIM5\u03b1 appears to resemble 'rolling hills' ( Figure 1D ) rather than rare , sharp peaks ( Figure 1C ) . Our DMS analyses of human TRIM5\u03b1 revealed unexpected ease of gaining antiviral potency against HIV-1 and potentially other lentiviruses . However , gains in potency against one virus might be offset by a concomitant loss of function against other viruses , as previously seen for the antiviral protein MxA ( Col\u00f3n-Thillet et al . , 2019 ) . Such functional tradeoffs might partially explain the evolutionary constraints acting on primate TRIM5\u03b1 sequences . To explore this possibility , we investigated the mutational resilience of N-tropic murine leukemia virus ( N-MLV ) restriction by TRIM5\u03b1 . N-MLV is strongly inhibited by both rhesus and human TRIM5\u03b1 , and this activity is at least partly dependent on the v1 loop ( Ohkura et al . , 2006; Perron et al . , 2006 ) . We infected cells expressing either the rhesus ( Figure 6A ) or WT human TRIM5\u03b1 ( Figure 6B ) v1 DMS libraries with GFP-marked N-MLV , sorted GFP-positive cells , and sequenced the non-restrictor variants . For both selections , stop codon variants were significantly more enriched than WT variants in the non-restrictor pool . Similar to HIV-1 restriction , we found that most missense mutations ( 143 , 58% ) in rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 were tolerated for N-MLV restriction ( Figure 6A ) . However , some missense mutations dramatically reduced N-MLV restriction , affirming that the v1 loop is indeed critical for inhibition of N-MLV ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C ) . In particular , hydrophobic and especially aromatic residues at most positions in the v1 loop significantly decreased N-MLV restriction . This preference against aromatic residues is similar between HIV-1 and N-MLV restriction . However , N-MLV restriction is insensitive to the introduction of positively charged residues , which disrupt HIV-1 inhibition ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . These results indicate that the evolutionary landscape for rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 against N-MLV is distinct from that of HIV-1 . Nevertheless , the overall degree of mutational resilience against both viruses is remarkably similar: less than half of all missense mutations disrupt restriction of either virus . Human TRIM5\u03b1 restriction of N-MLV was even more resilient to mutation than rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 . Almost all variants ( 187 , 92% ) had no effect on N-MLV restriction ( Figure 6B , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Indeed , our selection for non-restrictive variants only strongly enriched for stop codons . This extreme mutational resilience may reflect the massive potency ( >250 fold restriction , data not shown ) of human TRIM5\u03b1 against N-MLV , and/or a decreased reliance on the v1 loop for N-MLV recognition by human TRIM5\u03b1 ( Perron et al . , 2006 ) . We validated several human TRIM5\u03b1 mutants as retaining nearly WT levels of N-MLV restriction ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . Thus , both rhesus and human TRIM5\u03b1 inhibition of N-MLV is highly resistant to mutations , allowing mutational flexibility without loss of pre-existing antiviral restriction . These results , in conjunction with the substitution tolerance of HIV-1 restriction by human R332P and WT rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 , indicate that mutational resilience is a general property of TRIM5\u03b1\u2019s rapidly evolving v1 loop . \n Antiviral restriction factors are locked in high-stakes tit-for-tat evolutionary arms races with target viruses . However , viruses would appear to have the upper hand in these battles because of their higher mutation rates , shorter generation times , and larger population sizes . Although host genomes have the advantage of encoding a diverse , polygenic immune response , evolutionary constraints acting on innate immune genes could curtail their adaptive potential . Here , using deep-mutational scanning approaches combined with viral infection assays , we investigated the evolutionary landscape of adaptation of the most rapidly evolving segment , the disordered v1 loop , of the retroviral restriction factor TRIM5\u03b1 . We focused on this loop because of its critical role in adapting to changing viral repertoires . We found two attributes of this evolutionary landscape that favor host immune evolution . First , human TRIM5\u03b1 readily gains significant HIV-1 restriction: roughly half of all single missense mutations allow human TRIM5\u03b1 to better restrict HIV-1 ( Figures 2\u20133 ) . Based on our results , we infer that positive charge is the dominant impediment to HIV-1 inhibition in human TRIM5\u03b1 ( Figure 3D ) . Removal of this positive charge improved human TRIM5\u03b1 restriction not only of HIV-1 but also of multiple lentiviruses ( Figure 4A ) . Recent findings revealed that cyclophilin A ( CypA ) protects the HIV-1 capsid from TRIM5\u03b1 recognition ( Kim et al . , 2019; Selyutina et al . , 2020; Veillette et al . , 2013 ) . Although structural studies currently lack sufficient resolution to observe the molecular details of the TRIM5\u03b1\u2013capsid interaction , we speculate that positive charge in the v1 loop impairs an interaction between TRIM5\u03b1 and the capsid\u2019s CypA-binding site via electrostatic repulsion . Alternatively , the detrimental effect of positive charge might largely be accounted for by lowering TRIM5\u03b1 expression level ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D ) . Increasing human TRIM5\u03b1 expression has been shown to improve HIV-1 restriction ( Richardson et al . , 2014 ) , although we identified at least one mutation ( V340H ) that improved expression without increasing activity against HIV-1 and at least one mutation ( G333D ) that reduced positive charge and improved HIV-1 restriction without increasing expression level ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Surprisingly , our comprehensive DMS analyses also revealed that both rapidly evolving and conserved residues can contribute to antiviral adaptation ( Figure 3B ) . For instance , many variants at position 333 of human TRIM5\u03b1 led to increased restriction of HIV-1 and other lentiviruses ( Figures 3A and 4A ) . Thus , it is unclear why simian primates have retained a glycine at this position ( 333 in human , 335 in macaques ) . One possibility is that changes in this residue might be generally deleterious for TRIM5\u03b1 function , yet subsequent analyses revealed little or no impairment of TRIM5\u03b1 antiviral functions ( Figure 5D , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . More broadly , we identified many v1 loop mutations that improved human TRIM5\u03b1 restriction of HIV-1 , and even other lentiviruses , without impairing N-MLV antiviral function ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2D ) . This permissivity stands in stark contrast to the natural evolution of TRIM5\u03b1 , which has sampled relatively limited amino acid diversity ( Figure 1B ) . The discrepancy might be explained by recurrent selection by a viral lineage distinct from the viruses we tested here ( HIV-1 and N-MLV ) . For example , since the critical R332 was fixed at the common ancestor of humans , chimps , and bonobos\u00a0~7 million years ago , it is possible that R332 improved restriction of a paleovirus that has since gone extinct . Alternatively , TRIM5\u03b1\u2019s constrained natural evolution could reflect a cellular function independent of viral capsid recognition . For example , TRIM5\u03b1 has been shown to induce some innate immune signaling even in the absence of infection ( Lascano et al . , 2016; Pertel et al . , 2011; Tareen and Emerman , 2011 ) . Many gain-of-antiviral-function mutations increased TRIM5\u03b1 expression levels ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , and this increased expression might increase aberrant signaling by TRIM5\u03b1 , driving chronic immune activation that can be costly for the host ( Ashley et al . , 2012; Okin and Medzhitov , 2012 ) . Our analyses uncovered a second unexpected , advantageous aspect of TRIM5\u03b1\u2019s evolutionary landscape: its antiviral restriction displays remarkable mutational resilience across multiple orthologs and against two divergent retroviruses . 51\u201392% of all possible missense variants retain antiviral activity ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . This resilience is manifest even when potent antiviral activity is newly acquired via a single mutation , as with the R332P variant of human TRIM5\u03b1 against HIV-1 . Therefore , we conclude that the fitness landscape of TRIM5\u03b1's rapidly evolving v1 loop resembles 'rolling hills' ( Figure 1D ) , in which valleys are infrequent and only one evolutionary step removed from mutationally\u00a0tolerant plateaus . TRIM5\u03b1's permissive landscape contrasts with the relative inflexibility of ligand-binding domains in the core of evolutionarily conserved proteins ( Guo et al . , 2004; McLaughlin et al . , 2012; Suckow et al . , 1996 ) . However , these studies found increased mutational tolerance in peripheral , disordered loops not involved in critical functions like ligand recognition , where mutations are less likely to disrupt protein structure . The use of flexible loops for viral ligand binding by TRIM5\u03b1 , as well as MxA ( Mitchell et al . , 2012 ) , thus grants rapidly evolving restriction factors mutational flexibility without significant risk of disrupting core protein structure . Nevertheless , the degree of mutational plasticity in TRIM5\u03b1's v1 loop is remarkable given that this loop is essential for ligand binding , suggesting that even functional constraints do not narrow its evolutionary landscape . Intriguingly , TRIM5\u03b1's reliance on the v1 loop for specificity mirrors that of antibodies' dependence on complementarity-defining loops for antigen recognition . Indeed , a high degree of mutational tolerance within complementarity-defining loops allows somatic hypermutation to significantly increase antibody-antigen affinity ( Daugherty et al . , 2000; NISC Comparative Sequencing Program et al . , 2017 ) . Overall , our analyses reveal not only many paths for TRIM5\u03b1 to gain antiviral function but also an unexpectedly low probability of losing antiviral function via single mutations . Such landscapes should be highly advantageous to host genomes in evolutionary arms races with viruses . Mutational tolerance allows the accumulation of neutral variants that do not compromise antiviral function among antiviral genes in a population . Many of these novel variants may carry the capacity to restrict additional viruses , whether these result from cross-species transmissions or mutations that allow species-matched viruses to evade recognition by the dominant antiviral allele . Indeed , mutational tolerance has been shown to facilitate the evolution of de novo functions through the accumulation of neutral mutations ( Draghi et al . , 2010; Hayden et al . , 2011 ) . Although rare in human populations ( Clarke et al . , 2017 ) , extensive polymorphism within the v1 loop of TRIM5\u03b1 in Old World monkeys results in diverse antiviral repertoires that have been maintained by balancing selection ( Newman et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , TRIM5\u03b1 appears to evolve with low-cost , high-gain fitness landscapes that favor its success in co-evolutionary battles with rapidly evolving retroviruses . \n All virus-like particles ( VLPs ) were generated using three plasmids to ensure a single round of infectivity: a pseudotyping plasmid for transient expression of the VSV-G envelope protein ( pMD2 . G , Addgene plasmid #12259 , gift from Didier Trono ) , a plasmid for transient expression of the viral gag/pol , and a transfer vector encoding a green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) integration reporter between the corresponding viral LTRs . HIV-1 VLPs were made with the transfer vector pHIV-ZsGreen ( Welm et al . , 2008 ) ; HIV-2 and SIV VLPs used the pALPS-eGFP transfer vector ( McCauley et al . , 2018 ) ; and N-MLV was made with pQCXIP-eGFP , encoding GFP between the EcoRI and ClaI sites of pQCXIP ( P . S . Mitchell , unpublished ) . HIV-1 VLPs were made with p8 . 9NdSB bGH BlpI BstEII , encoding the NL4 . 3 HIV-1 gag/pol ( Berthoux et al . , 2004 ) . HIV-2 VLPs used a chimeric gag/pol , in which the HIV-1 CA sequence ( residues 1\u2013202 ) was replaced by HIV-2ROD ( p8 . 9NdSB bGH BlpI BstEII HIV-2 CA ) ( Pizzato et al . , 2015 ) . For SIV VLPs , pCRV1-based gag/pol chimeric vectors replaced the HIV-1 CA-NTD ( residues 1\u2013146 ) with the corresponding residues of either SIVmac239 , a virus passaged in rhesus macaques , here SIVmac ( pHIV-MAC , containing an A77V mutation ) ; or SIVcpzGab2 , a natural isolate from chimpanzee , here SIVcpz ( pHIV-Gb2 ) ( Kratovac et al . , 2008 ) . N-MLV VLPs were generated using pCIG3N , encoding the N-MLV gag/pol ( Bock et al . , 2000 ) . For stable expression of TRIM5\u03b1 constructs from pQCXIP , the MLV gag/pol was transiently expressed from JK3; the pseudotyping envelope protein was transiently expressed from the L-VSV-G plasmid and driven by expression of Tat from the CMV-Tat plasmid . C-terminally HA-tagged human , human with the rhesus macaque v1 loop , and rhesus macaque TRIM5\u03b1 ( Sawyer et al . , 2005 ) were amplified and cloned into pQCXIP ( Takara Bio , Kusatsu , Shiga , Japan ) , just upstream of the IRES\u2013puromycin resistance cassette , between the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites . Targeted TRIM5\u03b1 mutations were generated by Quikchange PCR using primers containing the desired point mutation flanked by 17\u201325 nucleotides of homology on each side of the mutation . Primestar polymerase ( Takara Bio ) was used to minimize errors during full-plasmid amplification , followed by DpnI digestion of unmodified parent DNA . All plasmids were cloned into high-efficiency chemically competent DH5\u03b1 ( NEB , Ipswich , MA ) . Plasmids were purified using PureYield miniprep kits ( Promega , Madison , WI ) , and coding sequences were verified by complete sequencing . See Table 1 for all primers used in cloning and sequencing . Deep mutational scanning libraries were generated using degenerate primers to amplify TRIM5\u03b1-HA in pQCXIP using high-fidelity Q5 polymerase ( NEB ) . Degenerate primers contained a single NNS codon ( N\u00a0=\u00a0A/T/C/G , S\u00a0=\u00a0C/G ) , which encodes all 20 amino acids with only one stop codon among 32 possibilities . For each of the 11 or 13 codons in the v1 loop of human or rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 , respectively , the two halves of TRIM5\u03b1 ( on either side of randomized codon ) were amplified separately with shared flanking primers and unique internal primers for each codon ( Table 1 ) . For the human TRIM5\u03b1 library in which R332P was fixed , internal primers matched the R332P variant of TRIM5\u03b1 and codon 332 was not randomized . Internal primers encoded NNS at the designated codon flanked by 17\u201325 nucleotides of homology on each side; the forward and reverse internal primers shared 17\u201325 nucleotides of homology with each other to promote hybridization between the N- and C-terminal PCR fragments . The codon-matched N- and C-terminal fragments were combined and amplified into a single fragment using the same flanking primers as in the first amplification . PCR products were gel purified and cloned via Gibson assembly ( NEB ) into pQCXIP-TRIM5\u03b1-HA of the matching species , which had been digested with NotI and BamHI and gel purified . Gibson assembly products were transformed into high-efficiency chemically competent DH5\u03b1 ( NEB ) with 30 min of heat shock recovery . Serial dilutions were plated to count the number of unique colonies , and transformations were repeated until at least 100x library coverage was achieved ( human: 32 \u00d7 11\u00d7100=3 . 52\u00d7104 colonies; rhesus: 32 \u00d7 13\u00d7100=4 . 16\u00d7104 colonies ) . To ensure library quality , 40 random colonies were sequenced from each library . Clones were verified to have insert by analytical restriction digest , and the coding sequence was fully sequenced to ensure that ( 1 ) each clone had only one mutation , ( 2 ) there were no mutations outside the v1 loop , and ( 3 ) the number of sites mutated once , twice , etc . among these 40 clones approximated a Poisson distribution . When libraries met these criteria , colonies were scraped from all transformation plates and plasmids were directly purified , without further growth to avoid amplification bias , using NucleoBond Xtra midiprep kits ( Takara Bio ) . HEK-293T/17 ( RRID:CVCL_1926 ) and CRFK ( RRID:CVCL_2426 ) cells were purchased from ATCC ( Manassas , VA ) and not further authenticated; cells were confirmed to be mycoplasma free by MycoProbe kit ( R and D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) . Cells were grown on tissue-culture treated plates in high-glucose and L-glutamine containing DMEM ( Thermo Fisher , Waltham , MA ) supplemented with 1x penicillin/streptomycin ( Thermo Fisher ) and 10% fetal bovine serum ( Thermo Fisher ) . Cells were grown at 37\u00b0C , 5% CO2 in humidified incubators and passaged by digestion with 0 . 05% trypsin-EDTA ( Thermo Fisher ) . Cell counting was performed using a TC20 automated cell counter ( BioRad , Hercules , CA ) . HEK-293T/17 were seeded at 5 \u00d7 105 cells/well in 6-well plates the day prior to transfection . Transfections were performed with Trans-IT 293T transfection reagent ( Mirus Bio , Madison , WI ) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions , using 3 \u00b5L reagent per \u00b5g DNA . All transfected DNA was purified using PureYield mini or NuceloBond midi kits to minimize LPS contamination and quantified by NanoDrop ( Thermo Fisher ) A260 . To produce HIV-1 , each well was transfected with 1 \u00b5g of p8 . 9NdSB , 667 ng of pHIV-ZsGreen , and 333 ng of pMD2 . G . N-MLV transfections contained 1 \u00b5g of pQCXIP-eGFP , 667 ng of pCIG3N , and 333 ng of pMD2 . G . HIV-2 , SIVcpz , and SIVmac transfections contained 1 \u00b5g of pALPS-eGFP , 333 ng of pMD2 . G , and 667 ng of either p8 . 9NdSB HIV-2 CA , pHIV-Gb2 , or pHIV-MAC , respectively . TRIM5\u03b1-transducing virus was produced using 1 \u00b5g of the appropriate TRIM5\u03b1 construct , 600 ng of JK3 , 300 ng of L-VSV-G , and 100 ng of CMV-Tat . After 24 hr , media was replaced with 1 mL of fresh media . Virus was harvested at 48 hr post-transfection . To harvest , cells were pelleted from virus-containing media at 500 x g , and supernatant was removed , aliquoted , and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen . To increase titers for HIV-2 and N-MLV , and in some cases HIV-1 , virus was concentrated prior to freezing . To concentrate , virus was pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion at 23 , 000 rpm ( ~70 , 000 x g ) for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C . Pellets were air dried for 5 min , and then resuspended in fresh media for 24 hr with periodic gentle vortexing . All viruses were titered under conditions most closely mimicking their large-scale use . CRFK cells were seeded at 1 \u00d7 105 cells/mL the day prior to transduction . Freshly thawed viruses were serially diluted and replaced cellular media at \u00bd x volume . No transducing reagent was used for GFP-marked retroviral VLPs; TRIM5\u03b1-transducing VLPs were supplemented with 10 \u00b5g/mL polybrene . Plates were centrifuged at 1100 x g for 30 min and then incubated at 37\u00b0C . The following day , virus was removed and cells were fed fresh media , which contained 6 \u00b5g/mL puromycin for TRIM5\u03b1-transducing VLPs only . For GFP-marked retroviral VLPs , transduction efficiency was monitored by flow cytometry 72 hr after transduction . For TRIM5\u03b1-transducing VLPs , cell survival was monitored daily by estimating cell confluence , until untransduced cells were completely dead ( no surface-adhered cells ) . Media was replaced with fresh puromycin-containing media every 2\u20133 days , and cells were passaged into larger well format as needed . Multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) for serial dilutions was estimated by Poisson distribution; for example , ~63% of cells are expected to be transduced at least once and thus survive selection with an MOI of 1 . To stably transduce TRIM5\u03b1 variants , we chose an MOI of\u00a0~0 . 33 ( 25\u201330% survival during titering ) to minimize multiple transductions per cell ( <5% probability ) . CRFK cells were seeded in six-well plates at 2 \u00d7 105 cells/well the day prior to transduction; for deep mutational scanning libraries , sufficient cells were seeded to generate at least 500x independent transductions for each nucleotide variant ( 32 codons x 13 sites x 500 \u00f7 25% survival\u00a0=\u00a08 . 3\u00d7105 cells ) . Cells were transduced at the appropriate MOI with 10 \u00b5g/mL polybrene and spinoculation ( 1100 x g , 30 min ) , then underwent 6 \u00b5g/mL puromycin selection starting at 24 hr post-transduction and continuing until untransduced controls were completely dead ( usually\u00a0~7 days ) . Upon completion of selection , surviving cells were pooled and maintained in 2 \u00b5g/mL puromycin . Passages always maintained at least 5 \u00d7 105 cells ( 1000x library coverage ) to avoid bottlenecking library diversity . CRFK cells expressing a TRIM5\u03b1 deep mutational scanning library were seeded in 12-well plates at 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well the day prior to viral infection . Sufficient wells were seeded for at least 1000x library coverage among target cells to be sorted 4 days later ( assuming at least two doublings in that time , with sorting frequency typically\u00a0~5% of cells as estimated beforehand by viral titering against DMS library-expressing cells ) . Thus , each biological replicate began with at least 2 . 4 \u00d7 106 cells ( 32\u00a0codons x 13 sites x 1000 \u00f7 5% \u00f7 4 ) seeded from the same CRFK library . Libraries were infected with HIV-1-GFP or N-MLV-GFP the following day . For loss-of-restriction experiments ( Figures 4\u20136 ) , we chose viral doses that were restricted by WT TRIM5\u03b1 to\u00a0<1% , as determined during preliminary titering experiments . For gain-of-HIV-1-restriction by human TRIM5\u03b1 , we chose a viral dose in which WT TRIM5\u03b1 was infected to\u00a0~98% , in order to minimize uninfected GFP-negative cells . Infection efficiency was monitored by parallel infection of controls ( empty vector , WT TRIM5\u03b1 , uninfected negative control ) . Cells were infected by spinoculation ( 1100 x g , 30 min ) and media was replaced 24 hr post-infection . Infected cells were incubated an additional 48 hr to increase GFP expression levels . Cells were harvested by trypsinization , pelleted , and vigorously resuspended as well as filtered ( 0 . 7 \u00b5m ) to minimize aggregation . Cells were FACS sorted , with stringent gating on size , single cells , and presence or absence of GFP ( for loss- or gain-of-restriction , respectively ) . At least 4 \u00d7 105 cells ( 1000x library coverage ) were sorted for each biological replicate . For gain-of-HIV-1-restriction by human TRIM5\u03b1 , sorted GFP-negative cells were pelleted and re-seeded at 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well for a second round of infection , at the same dose , the following day , in order to enrich true restrictors and deplete cells uninfected by chance . Infection , harvest , and FACS sorting were all performed identically , except that apparent HIV-1 restriction by pooled variants was improved in the second round of enrichment ( ~50% GFP-negative compared to\u00a0~10% in the first round of infection ) . Sorted cells were pelleted , resuspended in PBS , and genomic DNA was harvested using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kits ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . Input samples were harvested from infected but unsorted cells for each replicate . Illumina libraries were constructed from genomic DNA by 2-step PCR amplification using Q5 polymerase . The first PCR amplified the v1 loop of TRIM5\u03b1 and added adapters; the second set of PCR primers annealed to these adapters and added a unique 8 bp i7 Nextera barcode as well as P5 and P7 adapters for flow cell binding ( see Table 1 ) . Genomic DNA from each sample ( two input replicates , two sorted replicates for each experiment ) was amplified in three separate PCR tubes , with 500 ng of genomic DNA per tube , to offset random PCR jackpotting . This sampled a total of 1 . 5 \u00b5g of DNA , which represents\u00a0~500 x library coverage , assuming 6 . 6 pg gDNA/cell and a single TRIM5\u03b1 integration/cell . After 15 cycles of amplification , samples were digested for 15 min at 37\u00b0C with 5 \u00b5L of ExoI ( NEB ) to remove first round primers . PCR products were then pooled from triplicate tubes , purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit ( Qiagen ) , and the entire elution was divided between three separate PCR tubes for 18 cycles of second round amplification . Barcoded PCR products ( 234 bp ) were pooled from triplicate tubes and purified by double-sided size selection using Ampure beads ( Beckman Coulter , Pasadena , CA ) . In brief , large DNA was removed by incubation with 0 . 8x bead volume and magnetization; PCR products were bound from the supernatant with 1 . 5x bead volume , washed with 80% ethanol , and eluted in water . PCR product purity was confirmed by gel electrophoresis . Samples were then pooled at equimolar ratios and Illumina sequenced ( MiSeq-v2 ) with single-end reads . Estimated read depth ( equally distributed between libraries ) always exceeded 1 million counts per library to ensure\u00a0>1000 x coverage , on average , per nucleotide sequence . One read was generated using the i7 index primer for the 8 bp barcode , and a second read used a custom sequencing primer , which annealed immediately adjacent to the v1 loop ( 33 bp read for human , 39 bp for rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 ) . PhiX was included at 15% in sequencing runs to increase per-bp-diversity , since the majority ( 10/11 for human or 12/13 for rhesus ) of reads should not randomize any given codon . Reads counts for each unique nucleotide sequence from all four samples in an experiment were compiled into a single tsv file . Sequences that differed from WT by more than one codon , or sequences in which codons did not end in C or G , were filtered from the dataset; these largely had only a few reads per sample and represented sequencing errors . Reads counts were normalized to total counts per million ( cpm ) within each barcoded sample . Sequences with low read counts ( <50 cpm ) were excluded as they were found to introduce noise ( poor correlation between replicates and across codons ) . Enrichment was calculated as the ratio of sorted to input cpm . The average and standard deviation of enrichment was calculated across both replicates of all synonymous codons to determine statistics at the amino acid level , except for WT variants , where we show each synonymous variant separately ( averaged across replicates ) to better visualize WT variance . Amino acid enrichment values were plotted in waterfall plots ( descending order of enrichment ) , scatter plots ( comparing replicates ) , and double-gradient heat maps ( comparing amino acid variants at each position , with baseline value [white] set to the average for WT enrichment ) using GraphPad Prism . R scripts for data analysis , including all filtering , normalization , and calculations , as well as raw sequence reads have been uploaded to Github: https://github . com/jtenthor/T5DMS_data_analysis ( copy archived at https://github . com/jtenthor/T5DMS_data_analysis;\u00a0Tenthorey , 2020 ) . Viral inhibition by TRIM5\u03b1 constructs was always compared to CRFK cells transduced with empty vector . CRFK lines were seeded in 96-well plates at 1 \u00d7 104 cells/well the day prior to transduction . Media was removed and replaced with serial 3-fold dilutions of the appropriate GFP-marked retrovirus . Serial dilutions were started at titers that yielded\u00a0~95% infection in untransduced CRFK . Plates were centrifuged at 1100 x g for 30 min and then incubated at 37\u00b0C . The following day , virus was removed and cells were fed fresh media . Cells were harvested by trypsinization 72 hr after transduction and analyzed by flow cytometry for GFP fluorescence . Cells were gated on size ( FSC vs . SSC ) , single cells ( FSC height vs . area ) , and GFP-positive as compared to negative control ( FITC vs . PE empty channel ) . Fold inhibition was calculated by comparing ID10 , the amount of virus required to infect 10% of cells , between TRIM5\u03b1 and empty vector . Infection ( % GFP-positive ) was plotted against viral dose , both on logarithmic scale , as in Figure 2E . Infection points\u00a0<\u00a00 . 5% or\u00a0>\u00a050% GFP-positive were excluded due to increased noise or curve saturation , respectively , yielding a simple linear relationship between viral dose and % GFP-positive; infections without at least three data points in this range were excluded from further analysis . A linear regression ( against log-transformed data ) was then used to calculate the viral dose corresponding to 10% infection ( back-calculated to linear scale ) , and the dose for TRIM5\u03b1 was divided by that for empty vector . This method was used to calculate fold inhibition for all viruses except human TRIM5\u03b1 against N-MLV , as we could not consistently achieve infection greater than 1% for WT human TRIM5\u03b1; we therefore report raw infection data . All fold inhibitions were calculated from at least three independent experiments , which were performed either in biological singlicate or duplicate . CRFK cells stably expressing TRIM5\u03b1-HA variants were harvested by trypsinization , washed in PBS , and counted; 106 cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in 100 \u00b5L pre-chilled lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 1% Triton-X100 , 1x cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche , Basel , Switzerland] ) . Lysates were pelleted at 20 , 000 x g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C . Supernatants were quantified by Bradford protein assay ( BioRad ) and normalized to load equal protein across all samples ( usually 10\u201325 \u00b5g per lane ) . Samples were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli Sample Buffer ( BioRad ) supplemented with 5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and loaded onto Mini-PROTEAN TGX stain-free gels ( BioRad ) . Gels were run in Tris/Glycine/SDS buffer ( BioRad ) for 50 min at 150 V , then transferred semi-dry for 7 min at 1 . 3 mV using Trans-Blot Turbo 0 . 2 \u00b5m nitrocellulose transfer packs and the Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system ( BioRad ) . Blots were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer ( LI-COR , Lincoln , NE ) , then probed with mouse anti-HA at 1:1000 ( RRID:AB_2565335 , Biolegend , San Diego , CA ) and rabbit anti-\u03b2-actin at 1:5000 ( RRID:AB_2305186 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) . All antibodies were diluted in TBST with 5% bovine serum albumin ( Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . Blots were washed in TBST and probed with IRDye 680RD donkey anti-mouse ( RRID:AB_10953628 , LI-COR ) and IRDye 800CW donkey anti-rabbit ( RRID:AB_621848 , LI-COR ) , both diluted 1:10 , 000 . Blots were washed and scanned at 680 and 800 nm . HA intensities were quantified using ImageJ and normalized to actin , then compared to WT TRIM5\u03b1 to determine relative expression levels . A tBLASTn search of human TRIM5\u03b1 ( NP_149023 . 2 ) against primate genomes returned 29 unique simian primate orthologs of TRIM5\u03b1 . We excluded New World monkey sequences as they share a 9-amino acid deletion in the v1 loop . Open reading frames of the following sequences were translation aligned using MUSCLE: human ( Homo sapiens , NM_033034 . 2 ) , chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes , NM_001012650 . 1 ) , bonobo ( Pan paniscus , XM_003819046 . 3 ) , gorilla ( Gorilla gorilla , NM_001279549 . 1 ) , Sumatran orangutan ( Pongo abelii , NM_001131070 . 1 ) , Bornean orangutan ( Pongo pygmaeus , AY923179 . 2 ) , white-handed gibbon ( Hylobates lar , AY923180 . 1 ) , white-cheeked gibbon ( Nomascus leucogenys , NM_001280113 . 1 ) , crab-eating macaque ( Macaca fascicularis , NM_001283295 . 1 ) , rhesus macaque ( Macaca mulatta , NM_001032910 . 1 ) , olive baboon ( Papio anubis , NM_001112632 . 1 ) , collared mangabey ( Cercocebus torquatus , KP743974 . 1 ) , sooty mangabey ( Cercocebus atys , NM_001305964 . 1 ) , drill ( Mandrillus leucophaeus , XM_011971974 . 1 ) , Wolf\u2019s guenon ( Cercopithecus wolfi , KP743973 . 1 ) , red guenon ( Erythrocebus patas , AY740619 . 1 ) , grivet ( Cercopithecus aethiops , AY669399 . 1 ) , tantalus monkey ( Chlorocebus tantalus , AY740613 . 1 ) , African green monkey ( Chlorocebus sabaeus , XM_008019877 . 1 ) , vervet monkey ( Chlorocebus pygerythrus , AY740612 . 1 ) , golden snub-nosed monkey ( Rhinopithecus roxellana , XM_010364548 . 1 ) , and Angola colobus ( Colobus angolensis , XM_011963593 . 1 ) . A PHYML tree was built using the HKY85 substitution model with 100 bootstraps and rooted on human TRIM6 ( NM_001003818 . 3 ) . The unrooted tree was used for site-specific PAML analysis ( Yang , 1997 ) using both F3 \u00d7 4 and F61 codon models to ensure robust results . We performed maximum likelihood ( ML ) tests comparing model 7 ( neutral selection beta distribution ) to model 8 ( beta distribution with positive selection allowed ) . In each case , the model allowing positive selection gave the best fit to the data ( p<0 . 0001 , chi-squared test on 2x \u2206ML with two df ) . Model eight also identified rapidly evolving sites with a Bayes Empirical Bayes posterior probability\u00a0>0 . 95 . We report residues that meet this threshold for rapid evolution under both the F3 \u00d7 4 and F61 codon models . Evolutionarily accessible amino acids were defined as one nucleotide substitution away from the wild-type sequence . For Figure 1B , we determined all amino acids that were accessible from any of the 22 aligned sequences , then determined the fraction of these amino acids that were represented in our alignment . Evolutionary landscapes for Figure 1C\u2013D were generated from hypothetical data with 3D surface plots using the Plotly R package . All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism . Correlations between replicates or across experiments were computed using non-log-transformed data , and using non-parametric Spearman correlations where data did not pass normality tests . Student\u2019s unpaired t-tests were used to compare differences in mean values for normally distributed data from two groups; where variances were determined to be significantly different , Welch\u2019s correction was applied . For comparisons of more than two groups , one-way ANOVA tests were used with Holm-Sidak\u2019s multiple comparison correction; where variances were determined to be unequal , the Geisser-Greenhouse correction was applied .

These structures , however , are not self-sufficient and instead rely on proteins and chemicals that are imported from elsewhere in the cell . Two layers of membrane enclose the mitochondria , and transporting proteins across the inner and outer membranes requires large molecular machines embedded within the membranes . One such complex , the TIM22 complex , organizes tunnel-like carrier proteins that in turn ferry chemicals across the inner membrane to fuel metabolism . The TIM22 complex is vitally important as it allows mitochondria to adapt their metabolism \u2013 that is , how and when they generate energy \u2013 to match the cell\u2019s needs during development . Yet , while the TIM22 complex has been studied extensively in yeast , less is known about how it works in human cells . Now , Kang et al . have identified a new piece of the human equivalent of the TIM22 machinery , a protein called Tim29 , which helps to assemble the TIM22 complex in human cells . Experiments reveal that Tim29 also creates a link between human TIM22 and the TOM complex , a complex that serves as the general entry point through the outer mitochondrial membrane . Sequence analysis revealed that Tim29 is found in other animals , such as chimpanzees and cows , but not in yeast . This suggests that the mitochondrial machinery has changed during evolution . Kang et al . plan to further investigate how human carrier proteins reach the mitochondria , and exactly how Tim29 helps human TIM22 to cooperate with TOM . Overall , the discovery of Tim29 highlights the importance of looking at mitochondrial machinery across different species in the hope of revealing new components and mechanisms . A future challenge will be to determine how relevant these machines are in human development and diseases .", "source": "The TIM22 complex mediates the import of hydrophobic carrier proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane . While the TIM22 machinery has been well characterised in yeast , the human complex remains poorly characterised . Here , we identify Tim29 ( C19orf52 ) as a novel , metazoan-specific subunit of the human TIM22 complex . The protein is integrated into the mitochondrial inner membrane with it\u2019s C-terminus exposed to the intermembrane space . Tim29 is required for the stability of the TIM22 complex and functions in the assembly of hTim22 . Furthermore , Tim29 contacts the Translocase of the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane , TOM complex , enabling a mechanism for transport of hydrophobic carrier substrates across the aqueous intermembrane space . Identification of Tim29 highlights the significance of analysing mitochondrial import systems across phylogenetic boundaries , which can reveal novel components and mechanisms in higher organisms . \n Mitochondria cannot be created de novo and pre-existing mitochondria are used as templates for mitochondrial biogenesis . This genesis requires the ~1500 different mitochondrial proteins to be imported via dynamic translocation machines to one of four subcompartments of the organelle \u2013 outer and inner membrane , intermembrane space and matrix ( Chacinska et al . , 2009; Stojanovski et al . , 2012; Dolezal et al . , 2006; Harbauer et al . , 2014; Neupert and Herrmann , 2007; Baker et al . , 2014 ) . The Translocase of the Outer Membrane ( TOM ) complex is described as the general entry gate to mitochondria and provides a passageway through which precursors can cross the outer membrane . The mitochondrial inner membrane contains two translocase machines that are responsible for the import of a large fraction of the mitochondrial proteome; the Translocase of the Inner Membrane 23 ( TIM23 ) complex and the Translocase of the Inner Membrane 22 ( TIM22 ) complex . The TIM23 complex typically transports proteins that possess a matrix-targeting N-terminal presequence ( Chacinska et al . , 2009; Neupert and Herrmann , 2007; Wagner et al . , 2009; Mokranjac and Neupert , 2010 ) , while the TIM22 complex mediates the inner membrane insertion of multi-transmembrane spanning proteins that contain internal targeting elements ( Chacinska et al . , 2009; Neupert and Herrmann , 2007; Rehling et al . , 2004; Koehler , 2004 ) . Substrates of the TIM22 complex include the mitochondrial carrier family , such as the ADP/ATP carrier ( AAC ) and the phosphate carrier ( PiC ) , and multispanning inner membrane proteins like , Tim17 and Tim23 ( subunits of the TIM23 complex ) and Tim22 itself ( pore forming unit of the TIM22 complex ) ( Chacinska et al . , 2009; Stojanovski et al . , 2012; Koehler , 2004; Sirrenberg et al . , 1996; K\u00e1ldi\u00a0et\u00a0al . , 1998 ) . In yeast cells , TIM22 is a 300-kDa complex , consisting of four membrane integral subunits , Tim22 , Tim54 , Tim18 and Sdh3 , and a peripheral chaperone complex consisting of the small TIM proteins , Tim9-Tim10-Tim12 ( Adam et al . , 1999; Gebert et al . , 2011; Jarosch et al . , 1997 , 1996; Kerscher et al . , 1997 , 2000; Koehler et al . , 2000 , 1998; Kovermann et al . , 2002 ) . The small TIM proteins are a family of intermembrane space chaperones that facilitate the passage of hydrophobic membrane proteins through this aqueous environment . Tim9 and Tim10 form a soluble hexameric complex , but a fraction also interacts with the TIM22 complex via assembly with Tim12 ( Adam et al . , 1999; Gebert et al . , 2008; Baud et al . , 2007 ) . Like yeast , the human TIM22 complex consists of the channel-forming hTim22 protein , along with subunits of the small TIM family , hTim9 , hTim10a , and hTim10b ( M\u00fchlenbein et al . , 2004 ) , with hTim10b being the functional homologue of yeast Tim12 ( Koehler et al . , 1998; Baud et al . , 2007; M\u00fchlenbein et al . , 2004; Gentle et al . , 2007 ) . However , homologues of yeast Tim54 or Tim18 are absent in human cells and there is no evidence to indicate that the Sdh3 homologue , SDHC , interacts with the human TIM22 translocase . Thus , the true architecture of the human TIM22 complex remains an open question . Given the many elaborate functions of mitochondria in human cells , including , cell death , metabolism , tumorigenicity and neurodegenerative disorders , we reasoned the composition of the TIM22 complex in human cells is likely different to yeast . This led us to investigate the subunit composition of the human TIM22 complex . Here we report on the identification of C19orf52 as a novel subunit of the human TIM22 complex , and accordingly rename the protein as Tim29 . Tim29 functions in the assembly of hTim22 and consequently the stability of the TIM22 complex . Furthermore , we propose that Tim29 links the TIM22 complex to the general entry gate of mitochondria , the TOM complex . Our findings highlight the importance of analysing mitochondrial protein import across phylogenetic boundaries , since it can reveal novel facilitators of this essential cellular process , in addition to novel mechanisms . \n We sought to investigate the composition of the human TIM22 complex using affinity enrichment approaches . Exogenous expression of hTim22 in cells proved challenging , with the protein displaying a propensity to aggregate ( data not shown ) . However , this was not the case for hTim10b and we therefore generated a stable tetracycline-inducible HEK293T cell line expressing hTim10b3XFLAG . The FLAG-tagged protein was exclusively localised to mitochondria when assessed by fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 1A , upper panel ) . Blue Native ( BN ) -PAGE of isolated mitochondria revealed that hTim10b3XFLAG formed the same assemblies as the untagged hTim10b protein ( assessed by in vitro import of hTim10b into isolated mitochondria ) , including the hTim9-hTim10a-hTim10b hexamer and a higher molecular weight 450-kDa TIM22 complex ( Figure 1B and C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17463 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17463 . 004 We affinity-purified hTim10b3XFLAG and associated proteins using anti-FLAG resin ( Figure 1D ) and a stable cell line containing an empty vector was used as a negative control ( since we often observed leaky expression of hTim10b in un-induced cells ) . A single protein of the expected molecular weight was detected in the eluate fraction by western blotting with FLAG-specific antibodies ( Figure 1D , lane 7 , upper panel ) . Eluate fractions were then analysed by label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to reveal the interacting partners of hTim10b . Among proteins that co-purified specifically with hTim10b3XFLAG were known interacting partners hTim10a , hTim9 and hTim22 ( Figure 1E and Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) , which suggested the purification of functional TIM22 complexes . The uncharacterised protein , C19orf52 , also displayed significant enrichment in the hTim10b3XFLAG sample ( Figure 1E and Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . Sequence similarity searches for C19orf52 did not reveal homologs in lower eukaryotes . However , C19orf52 is conserved in metazoan species ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The previously uncharacterised protein is predicted to possess an N-terminal presequence at amino acids 1\u201316 , based on the MitoProt II bioinformatics program ( Claros , 1995; Claros and Vincens , 1996 ) and a single transmembrane domain spanning amino acids 61\u201379 ( Figure 2A ) . We first performed a\u00a0mitochondrial in vitro import assay to assess import of the protein into mitochondria . [35S]-C19orf52 was synthesised in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and imported into mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells . C19orf52 could be imported into a protease-protected location and in a time-dependent manner , but we did not observe proteolytic processing of the protein ( Figure 2B , upper panel ) , as observed for the presequence-containing , pre-ornithine transcarbamylase ( pOTC ) ( Figure 2B , lower panel ) . However , the import of C19orf52 was inhibited under conditions where the membrane potential ( \u0394\u03c8 ) had been dissipated ( Figure 2B , upper panel , lane 8 ) in a similar manner to pOTC ( Figure 2B , lower panel , lane 8 ) , suggesting import via a \u0394\u03c8-dependent import pathway . To confirm the mitochondrial localisation of C19orf52 and define the boundaries of the protein\u2019s targeting information , we expressed the following constructs in HeLa cells as C-terminal FLAG-tagged fusion proteins: ( i ) full length C19orf52 ( C19orf52WT ) ; ( ii ) C19orf52 lacking the 16 amino acids that make up the predicted presequence ( C19orf52\u039416 ) ; ( iii ) the N-terminal 89 amino acids of C19orf52 , which includes the predicted presequence and transmembrane domain ( aa 61\u201379 ) ( C19orf52aa1-89 ) ; ( iv ) the N-terminal 89 amino acids of C19orf52 , but lacking the predicted presequence ( C19orf52aa17-89 ) and ( v ) a N-terminal truncation of C19orf52 containing amino acids 80\u2013260 ( C19orf52aa80-260 ) . C19orf52 showed exclusive localisation to mitochondria ( Figure 2C , upper panel ) , confirming the protein is indeed mitochondrial . C19orf52\u039416 and C19orf52aa17-89 , which both lack the N-terminal 16 amino acids were both targeted to mitochondria , suggesting that residues 1\u201316 are dispensable for targeting to the organelle ( Figure 2C ) . Expression of C19orf52aa1-89 also displayed exclusive mitochondrial localisation , while C19orf52aa80-260 could not be targeted to mitochondria and was localised to the cytosol ( Figure 2C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17463 . 005Figure 2 .

Following import mitochondria were re-isolated and either left untreated ( lanes 1\u20134 ) or treated with Proteinase K ( lanes 5\u20138 ) .

Cells were immunostained with anti-FLAG and anti-NDUFAF2 ( mitochondria marker ) antibodies for visualisation using fluorescence microscopy . Scale bar: 10 \u00b5m . ( D ) Mitochondria were isolated from stable tetracycline-inducible HEK293T cells expressing C19orf523XFLAG . Intact mitochondria ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , mitoplasts ( generated by hypotonic swelling of the outer membrane , lanes 3 and 4 ) and solubilised mitochondria ( Triton X-100 , lanes 5 and 6 ) were incubated with or without Proteinase K ( 50 \u00b5g/ml ) and analysed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting using the indicated antibodies . ( E ) Mitochondria isolated from C19orf523XFLAG expressing cells were subjected to alkaline extraction using 100 mM Na2CO3 ( pH 11 and 12 ) .

C19orf52 lacking the N-terminal 16 amino acids is not sorted to the inner membrane . Mitochondria were isolated from cells transiently transfected with DNA encoding ( A ) C19orf52aa1-89 ( B ) C19orf52\u25b316 and ( C ) C19orf52aa17-89 as 3XFLAG fusions . Mitochondria ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , mitoplasts ( lanes 3 and 4 ) and solubilised mitochondrial membranes ( lanes 5 and 6 ) were left untreated ( lanes 1 , 3 and 5 ) or treated with Proteinase K ( lanes 2 , 4 and 6 ) . Intact mitochondria were also treated with sodium carbonate to separate mitochondrial proteins into membrane integrated ( pellet , P ) or peripheral ( supernatant , S ) proteins . Samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE and western-blotting . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17463 . 007 Next we addressed the sub-mitochondrial localisation of C19orf52 . We generated a stable tetracycline-inducible HEK293T cell line expressing C19orf523XFLAG . Hypo-osmotic swelling and carbonate extraction treatments were performed on the isolated mitochondria . C19orf523XFLAG was present in isolated mitochondria and only became accessible to external protease when the outer membrane was disrupted ( Figure 2D , compare lanes 2 and 4 ) , indicating the C-terminal FLAG tag is exposed to the intermembrane space . Outer membrane proteins Bak and Mfn2 , Opa1 that is exposed to the intermembrane-space and matrix-located NDUFAF2 served as controls . C19orf523XFLAG was resistant to carbonate treatment , like the membrane integrated Bak and Mfn2 , indicating that it is likely an integral membrane protein ( Figure 2E ) . In a similar manner , subfractionation and carbonate extraction of mitochondria isolated from cells expressing C19orf521-89 revealed that the truncated protein is also an integral membrane protein that exposes it\u2019s C-terminal FLAG tag to the intermembrane space ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . Taken together this data indicates that C19orf52 is an integral inner membrane protein with a C-terminal domain exposed to the intermembrane space . Surprisingly , upon subfractionation and carbonate extraction of mitochondria isolated from cells expressing C19orf52\u25b316 and C19orf5217-89 ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C and D ) we noticed that these proteins failed to sort properly to the inner membrane , but appeared trapped in the outer membrane , most likely in the TOM complex ( indicated by accessibility to protease and presence in both the pellet and supernatant fractions upon carbonate treatment ) . Thus , although the first 16 amino acids originally appeared to be dispensable for mitochondrial targeting , closer examination revealed that these residues are indeed crucial for subsequent sorting of C19orf52 to the inner membrane . Next we investigated the association of C19orf52 with the human TIM22 complex . Mitochondria from hTim10b3XFLAG and C19orf523XFLAG expressing cells were solubilised in digitonin-containing buffer prior to analysis by BN-PAGE and immunodecoration ( Figure 3A ) . C19orf52 specific antibodies revealed the presence of a high molecular weight complex of approximately 450-kDa , reminiscent of the TIM22 complex in both control ( Figure 3A , lane 1 ) and hTim10b3XFLAG mitochondria ( Figure 3A , lane 2 ) . We observed a slight delay in the migration of the C19orf52-containing complex in mitochondria isolated from hTim10b3XFLAG expressing cells ( Figure 3A , lane 2 and 4 ) . This suggested that C19orf52 is located within a hTim10b3XFLAG-containing complex and the presence of the FLAG-tag is causing the observed delay in mobility . To interrogate this observation further , we performed antibody-shift analysis of the human TIM22 complex . In this case , [35S]-hTim22 was imported into mitochondria isolated from control , hTim10b3XFLAG and C19orf523XFLAG expressing cells where it assembled into the mature TIM22 complex ( Figure 3B , lane 1 , 4 and 7 ) . Following import , mitochondria were isolated , solubilised in digitonin-containing buffer and incubated with anti-FLAG or anti-SDHA antibodies prior to BN-PAGE . As can be seen ( Figure 3B , lanes 2 , and 8 ) , the FLAG antibodies shifted [35S]-hTim22 ( hTIM22 complex ) in both hTim10b3XFLAG and C19orf523XFLAG containing mitochondria , suggesting the presence of all three proteins within the same complex . In an alternative approach C19orf523XFLAG was shown to specifically immunoprecipitate hTim22 ( Figure 3C ) , while C19orf52 could be co-immunoprecipitated with hTim10b3XFLAG ( Figure 3D ) . As a final source of confirmation immunoprecipitation of C19orf523XFLAG and subsequent quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis revealed the presence of all known TIM22 complex subunits , including hTim22 , hTim10b , hTim10a and hTim9 ( Figure 3\u2014source data 1 ) . These findings confirm that C19orf52 is a bona fide subunit of the human TIM22 complex , and represents a novel metazoan specific subunit of the translocation machine . Given that the molecular weight of the protein is 29\u2009kDa and the nomenclature of the mitochondrial protein import machinery ( Pfanner et al . , 1996 ) , we henceforth rename this protein as Tim29 and its gene as TIMM29 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17463 . 008Figure 3 .

Knockdown ( KD ) of Tim29 was assessed relative to cells transfected with a non-targeting control and we also performed KD of hTim22 , which allowed us to monitor the implications of shutting down the carrier pathway ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A and B ) . To address the global impact of Tim29 and hTim22 KD on cell health and viability we monitored the impact of Tim29 and hTim22 KD on mitochondrial respiration , cell proliferation and cell viability . We measured mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates in intact cells by high-resolution respirometry to determine if the KD of Tim29 and hTim22 affects mitochondrial metabolism . Knockdown of Tim29 significantly reduced basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption to 65% ( p<0 . 05 ) compared to cells transfected with a control scrambled siRNA ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . This reduction in basal oxygen consumption was similar to that observed in hTim22 KD cells ( 61% residual respiration , p<0 . 05 ) . Following addition of FCCP , the maximal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate was also significantly lower in Tim29 KD cells compared to control cells ( 88% residual respiration , p<0 . 05 ) and in hTim22 knockdown cells compared to the control ( 63% , p<0 . 05 ) . KD of both Tim29 and hTim22 did not have any significant impact on cell proliferation ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D ) , or cell viability ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . Next we assessed the impact of KD of Tim29 on TIM22 complex substrates at the steady state protein level . As can be seen , Tim29 ( Figure 4A ) and hTim22 ( Figure 4B ) were depleted from mitochondria while the control protein Mfn2 remained unaffected ( Figure 4A and B , bottom panels ) . Specific depletion of TIM22 complex substrates , including hTim23 , ANT3 and the glutamate carrier was observed in both Tim29 and hTim22 depleted mitochondria ( quantifications shown in Figure 4A and B , lower panels ) . The depletion of Tim29 also led to a significant reduction in the levels of hTim22 ( Figure 4A ) , while the lack of hTim22 had no obvious effect on the levels of Tim29 , indicating Tim29 is imported in a TIM22-independent manner ( Figure 4B ) . BN-PAGE analysis also revealed that depletion of Tim29 caused a reduction in the assembly of ANT3 and hTIM23 complexes ( Figure 4C ) , with the latter causing a reduction in the steady state level of TIM23 complex substrates ( COXIV , NDUFV2 and NDUFV1 ) ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A ) and import of [35S]-NDUFV1 and [35S]-NDUFV2 ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B and C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17463 . 010Figure 4 .

This observation and the decrease of endogenous TIM22 complex substrates in Tim29 KD cells , prompted us to address if this decrease was due to: ( i ) an active role of Tim29 in the import of substrates into the inner membrane , or ( ii ) a role of Tim29 in the biogenesis of the TIM22 complex itself . To address this , we investigated the in vitro\u00a0import and assembly of two well-established substrates of the TIM22 pathway , ANT1 and hTim23 . While the assembly of ANT1 was reduced in the absence of hTim22 at 60\u2009min ( Figure 5A; right panel ) , assembly of the protein proceeded like WT in the absence of Tim29 ( Figure 5A; left panel ) . In contrast , the assembly of hTim23 was mildly reduced in mitochondria depleted of either Tim29 or hTim22 ( Figure 5B ) . We next addressed the assembly of the TIM22 complex itself using the radiolabelled hTim22 . In mitochondria isolated from control cells , [35S]-hTim22 efficiently assembled into the 450-kDa TIM22 complex ( Figure 6A and B , lanes 1\u20134 ) , while there was a clear assembly defect into the TIM22 complex in mitochondria isolated from Tim29 KD cells ( Figure 6A , lanes 5\u20138 ) . The amount of assembled TIM22 complex in Tim29 KD mitochondria was lower than that in the control mitochondria by 53% , after a 60 min-import . To support this observation , we examined the difference in hTim22 protein assembly in control and Tim29 KD mitochondria using a two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test . We obtained a t[2]\u00a0= 6 . 02 ( p<0 . 05 ) , demonstrating a significant reduction in the assembly of hTim22 into the mature complex in Tim29 KD mitochondria . On the contrary , we consistently detected a moderate increase ( ~20% ) in assembled TIM22 complex in hTim22 KD mitochondria after a 60 min-import compared to control mitochondria ( t[2]\u00a0= \u22125 . 07 , p<0 . 05 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17463 . 013Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17463 . 014 In the absence of Tim29 we did observe a minor decrease in the import kinetics of [35S]-hTim22 by SDS-PAGE ( Figure 7 ) , however , following treatment of isolated mitochondria with sodium carbonate it was apparent that [35S]-hTim22 protein efficiently integrated into the inner membrane in mitochondria isolated from both Tim29 and hTim22 KD cells ( Figure 7C and D ) . Based on these observations , we conclude that Tim29 is required for the assembly of the hTim22 protein into the TIM22 complex . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17463 . 015Figure 7 . hTim22 is integrated into the inner membrane in the absence of Tim29 .

WB , indicates western blot . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17463 . 015 Coupling of the TOM and TIM23 complexes in yeast mitochondria is believed to enhance the import efficiency of presequence-containing precursors ( Chacinska et al . , 2005 , 2003; Waegemann et al . , 2015; Mokranjac et al . , 2009; Popov-\u010celeketi\u0107 et al . , 2008 ) . More recently , coupling between the TOM and SAM complexes of the outer membrane in yeast mitochondria has been shown to be important for the biogenesis of \u03b2-barrel proteins ( Wenz et al . , 2015; Qiu et al . , 2013 ) . Interestingly , no interaction has ever been reported between the TOM and TIM22 translocases in yeast mitochondria . Rather , the carrier pathway is described as a series of five stages , with stage 3 encompassing the transfer of substrates between the TOM and TIM22 complexes by the soluble intermembrane space Tim9-Tim10 complex ( Chacinska et al . , 2009; Rehling et al . , 2004; Ryan et al . , 1999 ) . Given that Tim29 exposes a domain into the intermembrane space , we reasoned it could have a role in linking the TIM22 complex to the TOM complex in mammalian mitochondria . Mitochondria were isolated from control and Tim293XFLAG expressing cells , solubilised in digitonin and incubated with anti-FLAG resin for immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged proteins and associated partners . As expected , we observed co-elution of hTim9 with Tim293XFLAG . Interestingly , we observed a fraction of both hTom40 and hTom22 co-eluting with Tim293XFLAG , suggesting a co-operation between Tim29 and the TOM complex ( Figure 8A ) . To confirm this interaction , we imported radiolabelled versions of hTom40 , hTom22 and hTim9 ( positive control ) into mitochondria isolated from control and Tim293XFLAG expressing cells and following import subjected the isolated mitochondria to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG resin ( Figure 8B ) . Indeed a fraction of both hTom40 and hTom22 were observed in the Tim29 elution fraction ( Figure 8B , middle and lower panels ) , like that of the control protein hTim9 ( Figure 8B , upper panel ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17463 . 016Figure 8 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17463 . 017 If the interaction we observed between TIM22 and TOM was authentic , it should be possible to perform the reverse experiment , i . e . copurification of the TIM22 complex with a tagged TOM complex . We generated an N-terminally-tagged variant of TOM22 , which localised to mitochondria and assembles into the TOM complex ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Upon solubilisation of the 3XFLAGhTom22 mitochondria and immunoprecipitation we observed co-purification of hTom40 and hTom70 ( Figure 8C ) as expected . We also observed a fraction of hTim9 , Tim29 and hTim22 co-purifying with the TOM complex , while numerous controls of the outer membrane ( hFis1 ) , intermembrane space ( cytochrome c ) , inner membrane ( OPA1 , hTim23 , Glutamate carrier , COXIV ) and matrix ( NDUFV1 , NDUFV2 ) did not co-elute with hTom22 ( Figure 8C ) . Given that the TIM22 complex was not purified in great amounts , the data suggest the interaction between TOM and TIM22 complexes is labile in the absence of precursor protein , or under the conditions employed for the immunoprecipitation . To explore the relationship between TOM and TIM22 further , we performed chemical cross-linking with dithiobis ( succinimidylpropionate ) ( DSP ) , an amino-group-specific homobifunctional crosslinker that is cleaved by reducing agents . Mitochondria isolated from control and Tim293XFLAG expressing cells were incubated with DSP , solubilised in SDS to dissociate non-covalent interactions and then incubated with anti-FLAG resin for purification of Tim293XFLAG-containing species . Eluate fractions were treated under reducing conditions in order to liberate cross-linked species . Interestingly , we found hTom40 cross-linked to Tim29 ( Figure 9A and B ) , but not hTom22 ( Figure 9B , third panel from top ) . We also observed crosslinks between Tim29 and hTim9 , but not hTim22 ( most likely due to the lack of primary amines in the predicted Tim29 transmembrane domain , which are essential for the amine-reactive crosslinker DSP ) ( Figure 9A ) . We next performed cross-linking using mitochondria isolated from cells expressing hTim10b3XFLAG and although we observed cross-links of hTim10b with both hTim9 and Tim29 we did not observe any crosslinks with hTom40 ( Figure 9C ) . Taken together , these results suggest that Tim29 acts as a bridge between the TIM22 and TOM complexes . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17463 . 018Figure 9 . Tim29 interacts with hTom40 .

While the yeast TIM22 complex and import pathway have been extensively characterised , the human TIM22 complex has remained ill defined . Conservation of members of the human TIM22 complex ( hTim22 and small TIM proteins ) based on sequence homology was originally published approximately 17 years ago ( Bauer et al . , 1999 ) . Advances and accessibility in techniques for purification of native complexes and mass spectrometry have now provided us with an opportunity to unravel the true subunit composition of the human complex . Our work brings the number of known subunits of the human TIM22 complex to five: hTim22 ( Sirrenberg et al . , 1996; Bauer et al . , 1999 ) , hTim9 , hTim10a , hTim10b ( M\u00fchlenbein et al . , 2004; Gentle et al . , 2007; Bauer et al . , 1999 ) and Tim29 ( this study ) . Interestingly , our immunoprecipitations and mass spectrometry data for both hTim10b3XFLAG and C19orf523XFLAG did not reveal the presence of SDHC , suggesting the human protein is not a subunit of the human TIM22 complex , at least under the conditions in which we perform the immunoprecipitation experiments . Gebert et al . ( 2011 ) showed that the assembly of yeast Sdh3 at both Complex II and TIM22 is influenced by the formation of different sub-complexes with the highly homologous Sdh4 and Tim18 . The Sdh3-Sdh4 and Sdh3-Tim18 subcomplexes subsequently deliver the protein to either Complex II or TIM22 , respectively . It is feasible to suggest that the lack of Tim18 in human mitochondria could prevent the association of SDHC to the hTIM22 complex . Tim29 was a previously uncharacterised protein , however the MitoCarta 2 . 0 inventory indicated the protein was a mitochondrial protein with a wide tissue distribution ( Calvo et al . , 2016 ) . Mitochondrial subfractionation and carbonate extraction confirmed that Tim29 is an integral protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane . Given that there is only one predicted transmembrane region , we propose Tim29 is inserted into the mitochondrial inner membrane via this single transmembrane segment , with its amino-terminus facing the matrix and carboxyl-terminus exposed to the intermembrane space . Interestingly , we confirmed that targeting and proper sorting of Tim29 to the inner membrane relies on the first 89 amino acids of the protein . Although fluorescence microscopy suggested that constructs lacking the first 16 amino acids ( Tim29\u25b316 and Tim29aa17-89 ) could be targeted to mitochondria , closer investigation using mitochondrial subfractionation and carbonate extraction reveals these proteins failed to sort to the inner membrane . Given this observation and that the knockdown of hTim22 did not influence the levels of Tim29 , the protein is most likely imported via the TIM23 complex , however this needs to be experimentally verified . Knockdown of Tim29 resulted in a reduction in the steady-state levels of ANT , but import and assembly kinetics of radiolabelled ANT were similar to control mitochondria . In contrast , hTim23 , which is also a substrate for the hTIM22 complex showed an assembly defect both in vitro and at the steady state level . Such a scenario has previously been reported for the yeast TIM22 complex , with deletion of Tim18 differentially affecting the import kinetics of the AAC and Tim23 ( Kerscher et al . , 2000; Koehler et al . , 2000 ) . It is possible that depletion of Tim29 affects the activity of the human TIM23 complex by a more direct mechanism , whereas the import of ANT only requires the TIM22 complex and the residual complex remaining following knockdown is enough to import and assemble the small amounts of radiolabelled protein used in the in vitro import assay . The depletion of Tim29 also caused a reduction in the levels of the TIM22 complex when assessed by BN-PAGE . Given that hTim22 is integrated into the membrane in mitochondria isolated from the Tim29 KD cells , we conclude that Tim29 is required for the assembly of hTim22 into the TIM22 complex . In addition to this role our data indicate that Tim29 facilitates cooperation between the TIM22 and TOM complexes , by directly interacting with hTom40 . Cooperation between the TOM and TIM23 complexes is well established in yeast cells ( Chacinska et al . , 2005 , 2003; Waegemann et al . , 2015; Mokranjac et al . , 2009; Popov-\u010celeketi\u0107 et al . , 2008; Chacinska et al . , 2010 ) , however a similar interaction between the TOM and TIM22 complex has not been reported thus far . We have captured an interaction between the TOM and TIM22 complexes in organello using both Tim29 and hTom22 as bait . Furthermore , using chemical crosslinking we narrowed down specific interactions between: ( i ) Tim29 and hTim9; ( ii ) Tim29 and hTim10b; hTim10b and hTim9; and Tim29 and hTom40 . We were puzzled to see an interaction between Tim29 and hTom40 , since in yeast TIM23 interacts with TOM via Tom22 , which exposes a domain into the intermembrane space ( Waegemann et al . , 2015; Chacinska et al . , 2010 ) . However , Shiota and colleagues ( 2015 ) recently showed that the intermembrane space chaperone , Tim10 interacts with an N-terminal region of Tom40 . This suggests that the N-terminal region of Tom40 extends through the \u03b2-barrel pore into the intermembrane space ( Shiota et al . , 2015 ) , and such a mechanism could be mediating the interaction between hTom40 and the intermembrane space localised region of Tim29 . In yeast the intermembrane space chaperones Tim9-Tim10 passage carrier precursors through the aqueous intermembrane space delivering them from TOM to TIM22 ( Chacinska et al . , 2009; Rehling et al . , 2004; Ryan et al . , 1999 ) . Why would a TOM-TIM22 interaction be necessary in human mitochondria ? The answer could lie with the nature of the small TIM chaperones within mammalian mitochondria . Early studies by M\u00fchlenbein and colleagues ( 2004 ) suggested that human mitochondria lack soluble Tim9-Tim10 complexes , but rather these proteins are more tightly associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane . Thus , even though the function of the small TIM proteins has been conserved through evolution , the import of carrier proteins into mammalian mitochondria is efficient even in the absence of soluble Tim9-Tim10 complexes . Therefore , it is likely that other mechanisms have evolved that serve to prevent the hydrophobic carrier proteins from aggregating in the intermembrane space . A close association between the TOM and TIM22 complexes could be one such mechanism . Our data represents a major conceptual advance and challenges the common dogma that carrier proteins are transported across the mitochondrial intermembrane space via soluble intermediates . Further investigation is necessary to tease out the precise role of the TOM-TIM22 interaction and how it is influenced by the presence of precursor protein . In summary , by assessing the subunit composition of the human TIM22 complex , we have identified Tim29 and uncovered a novel interaction between the TIM22 and TOM complexes . This suggests that novel mechanisms are overseeing the import of carrier proteins into human mitochondria . Interestingly , Tim29 ( C19orf52 ) was recently shown to be up-regulated in primary hepatocellular carcinoma cells ( Xing et al . , 2015a , 2015b ) . Indeed , numerous human pathologies have been linked to protein import dysfunction ( Sokol et al . , 2014; Xu et al . , 2010; Sinha et al . , 2014; Di Fonzo et al . , 2009; Koehler et al . , 1999; Roesch et al . , 2002; Sankala et al . , 2011; Davey et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , examining protein import machineries and pathways in human cells is essential and will pave the way to deeper understanding of how mitochondrial protein import influences cell viability , physiology and ultimately human pathologies . \n Cell lines used in this work were Flp-IN\u00a0T-REx\u00a0293 ( purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific\u00a0Australia; RRID:CVCL_U427 ) ; FreeStyle 293-F ( HEK293FS; purchased from ( Thermo Fisher Scientific; RRID:CVCL_D603 ) and HeLa cells ( RRID:CVCL_0030 ) ;\u00a0kindly provided by Prof .

Cells were incubated until individual colonies appeared and these were selected and expanded and screened for protein expression by the addition of tetracycline at 1 \u00b5g/ml . Cells were cultured in with 5\u201310% ( v/v ) tetracycline-reduced FBS ( Clontech ) . For ectopic expression and generation of stable cells Lipofectamine 2000 was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines ( Thermo Fischer Scientific ) . Custom siRNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Adrich . The following sequences and concentrations were utilised: Tim29 ( 5\u2019 GGCUCUUCGAUGAGAAGUA 3\u2019 , 10 nM ) and hTim22 ( 5\u2019 CCAUUGUGGGAGCCAUGUU 3\u2019 , 10 nM ) .

Cells were analysed after 72 or 96\u2009hr post-transfection for protein knock-down . For immunofluorescence , cells grown on coverslips were fixed by incubation with 4% ( w/v ) paraformaldehyde solution ( Sigma-Aldrich ) for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilised by incubation with PBS containing 0 . 2% ( v/v ) Triton X-100 . This was followed by incubation with the desired primary antibody made up in 3% ( w/v ) bovine serum albumin , 0 . 2% ( v/v ) Triton X-100 in PBS for 1\u2009hr . Following washing in 0 . 2% ( v/v ) TX-100 cells were incubated with secondary antibody anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 ( RRID:AB_2534069 ) or anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 ( RRID:AB_2534078; Molecular Probes ) . For nuclear staining , cells were incubated with 0 . 01 mg/ml Hoechst 33258 ( Sigma-Aldrich ) in PBS for 5 min following incubation with secondary antibodies . Cells were analysed using Deltavision DV Elite Imaging System ( Applied Precision ) and then deconvolved images were analysed using ImageJ . Isolation of mitochondria from tissue culture cells was performed by differential centrifugation as described previously ( Johnston et al . , 2002 ) . For mitochondrial sub-fractionation experiments mitochondrial pellets ( 50 \u00b5g of mitochondrial protein ) were resuspended in the\u00a0isolation buffer ( 20\u2009mM HEPES-KOH pH 7 . 4 , 70\u2009mM sucrose , 220\u2009mM Mannitol , 1\u2009mM EDTA ) , swelling buffer ( 10\u2009mM HEPES-KOH pH 7 . 4 ) or solubilisation buffer ( 0 . 5% [v/v] Triton-X-100 ) . Samples were split and either left untreated or treated with proteinase K ( 50 \u00b5g/ml ) for 10\u2009min on ice . For sodium carbonate extraction , mitochondrial pellets ( 50 \u00b5g ) were resuspended in freshly prepared Na2CO3 ( 100\u2009mM , pH 11 or pH 12 ) . Samples were incubated on ice for 30\u2009min with occasional mixing and subsequently centrifuged at 100 , 000\u2009g for 30\u2009min . Mitochondrial subfractionation and carbonate extraction samples were TCA precipitated and analysed by SDS- PAGE and immunoblotting . For crosslinking experiments , mitochondria ( 0 . 5\u20131 mg ) were resuspended in import buffer ( 20\u2009mM HEPES-KOH pH 7 . 4 , 250\u2009mM sucrose , 80\u2009mM KOAc , 5\u2009mM MgOAc , and 5\u2009mM ATP ) and incubated with the amino-group-specific homobifunctional and cleavable crosslinker , DSP; dithiobis ( succinimidylpropionate ) ( ThermoFisher ) at a final concentration of 0 . 2\u2009mM for 1\u2009hr at 4\u00b0C . Crosslinking reactions were quenched using 100\u2009mM Tris-Cl , pH 7 . 4 for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C . Mitochondria were reisolated and solubilised in lysis buffer ( 20\u2009mM Tris-Cl , pH 7 . 4 , 1\u2009mM EDTA , 1% ( w/v ) SDS ) and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 5\u2009min . Clarified samples were diluted with 1% Triton X-100-containing buffer ( 1% ( v/v ) Triton X-100 , 20\u2009mM Tris-Cl pH 7 . 4 , 150\u2009mM NaCl , 1X complete protease inhibitor ) and incubated with pre-equilibrated anti-FLAG resin for 1\u2009hr at 4\u00b0C . Following washing specifically bound proteins were eluted in 2X Laemmli buffer . Open reading frames ( ORF ) encoding mitochondrial precursor proteins were cloned into pGEM4Z ( Promega ) . The desired ORFs were amplified by PCR using vector specific primers ( M13_FORWARD and M13_REVERSE ) and applied to in vitro\u00a0transcription reactions using the mMessage SP6 transcription kit ( Ambion ) . mRNA was isolated by LiCl precipitation according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and applied to in vitro translation reactions using rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( Promega ) in the presence of [35S]-methionine/cysteine ( Perkin-Elmer ) .

Samples subjected to protease treatment were incubated on ice for 10\u2009min with 50\u2009\u03bcg/ml proteinase K ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , followed by the addition of 1\u2009mM PMSF and incubation for 10\u2009min on ice . For analysis of protein complexes by blue native electrophoresis and antibody-shift mitochondria were solubilised in 1% digitonin ( at 1\u00a0mg/mL ) and incubated with the desired antibody for 30\u2009min on ice , prior to clarification and subsequent analysis by BN-PAGE . Following in vitro import samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and BN-PAGE and radiolabelled proteins were detected by digital autoradiography . Protein import assays were performed in triplicate unless indicated otherwise . [35S]-proteins were visualised using Typhoon PhosphorImage ( GE healthcare ) and were analysed using ImageJ software ( RRID:SCR_003070 ) . The intensity of relevant bands was determined by subtracting the background signal to give the true relative amount of protein ( assembled complexes for BN-PAGE analysis and imported proteins for SDS-PAGE analysis ) . Each specific time point was normalised against the value in control mitochondria with the longest import time point and were computed as a\u00a0% of this control . Differences in the import of proteins between control ( scrambled siRNA ) and Tim29 or hTim22 knock-down mitochondria were examined using a paired two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test on 2 d . f . based on the three log ratios ( control/knockdown ) of imported or assembled protein . Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was measured by high-resolution respirometry with an Oxygraph-2K oxygen electrode ( Oroboros Instruments , Innsbruck , Austria ) as previously described ( Lim et al . , 2015 ) . Intact cells were incubated in 2\u2009mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM , high glucose , pyruvate , Glutamax ) ( ThermoFisher ) supplemented with 5% v/v fetal bovine serum and 1x penicillin/streptomycin at 37\u00b0C . Basal oxygen consumption rates were recorded , followed by the addition of 10\u2009\u03bcM carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone ( FCCP ) to obtain maximal oxygen consumption rates . Non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates were determined by the addition of 5\u2009\u03bcM antimycin A and subtracted from basal and maximal rates . Oxygen flux was calculated using DatLab software ( version 4 . 3 . 4 . 51 , Oroboros Instruments ) and expressed as pmol/s/mg of total cell protein . Each assay was performed in triplicate , with significant differences determined using a two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test . Proliferation of control ( scrambled siRNA ) , hTim22 and Tim29 siRNA transfected cells was examined using the bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) Cell Proliferation ELISA kit ( Abcam-ab126556 ) . BrdU reagent was added to cells 48\u2009hr post siRNA transfection and incubated with cells for 24\u2009hr . BrdU incorporation into newly synthesised DNA was measured by absorbance at 450 nm and 550 nm ( background ) using a\u00a0FLUOstar OPTIMA microplate reader ( BMG LABTECH ) . Assays were performed in triplicate . Cell viability was determined using propidium iodide staining . Briefly , cells were harvested and washed and resuspended in FACS buffer ( 0 . 1% BSA diluted in PBS , 2\u2009mM EDTA ) followed by incubation with 3 . 1 \u00b5g/mL of propidium iodide ( Sigma ) . Cells were screened by flow cytometry using Flowjo software ( RRID: SCR_008520 ) . Plots of the area of forward-scattered light ( FSC-A ) versus side-scattered light ( SSC-A ) were used as the cell gating strategy for identification of any changes in the scatter properties of the cells . Single cell events were identified using the height and width parameters in FSC and SSC . A dot plot using the area of propidium iodide ( PI-A ) was used to determine the relative proportion of viable and dead cells ( % ) . For Blue-native gel electrophoresis mitochondrial pellets were solubilised in ice-cold digitonin-containing buffer ( 1% [w/v] digitonin , 20\u2009mM Tris , pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 1\u2009mM EDTA , 50\u2009mM NaCl , 10% [w/v] glycerol ) at 1\u00a0mg/mL and incubated on ice for 15\u201320\u2009min . Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 16 , 000\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C , upon which sample buffer ( 1/10th the volume- 5% [w/v] Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 , 100\u2009mM Bis-Tris , pH 7 . 0 , 500\u2009mM \u03b5-amino-n-caproic acid ) was added . Samples were separated on 4\u201316% polyacrylamide gradient gels at 4\u00b0C . Thyroglobulin ( 669\u2009kDa ) , Ferritin ( 440\u2009kDa ) and Bovine Serum Albumin ( 132 and 66\u2009kDa ) were used as molecular weight markers . SDS-PAGE was performed using gradient Tris-tricine gels as previously described ( Sch\u00e4gger and von Jagow , 1987 ) . For western blot analysis , gels were transferred to PVDF membranes .

Antibodies against human Bak , human Tom22 , human Tom40 , Mfn2 , NDUFAF2 and NDUFA9 were kindly provided by Prof . Michael Ryan ( Monash University , Australia ) . Standard immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with 0 . 5\u20131 mg mitochondria and analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis . For mass spectrometry ( MS ) experiments , 5 mg of mitochondria were used . Briefly , isolated mitochondria from control cells ( empty vector ) and cells expressing FLAG tagged proteins were solubilised in digitonin-containing buffer ( described above ) supplemented with 1X complete protease ( Roche ) at 2 mg/mL end over end on a rotary wheel for 30\u201360\u2009min at 4\u00b0C . The mitochondrial lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16 , 000\u2009g at 4\u00b0C for 30\u2009min and diluted in solubilisation buffer ( 20\u2009mM Tris , pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 1\u2009mM EDTA , 50\u2009mM NaCl , 10% [w/v] glycerol , 1X complete protease inhibitor ) so that a final digitonin concentration of 0 . 1% was achieved . The cleared lysates were applied to pre-equilibrated anti-FLAG agarose ( Sigma-Aldrich ) and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 60\u2009min under mild agitation . Unbound material was collected and the anti-FLAG resin and bound proteins were washed X 3 in digitonin-containing buffer ( 0 . 1% digitonin [w/v] , 20\u2009mM Tris , pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 1\u2009mM EDTA , 50\u2009mM NaCl , 10% [w/v] glycerol , 1X complete protease inhibitor ) . Bound proteins were eluted with 0 . 2\u2009M glycine , pH 2 . 5 . Glycine eluted fractions were electrophoretically separated using SDS-PAGE and proteins were visualised by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain . Gel lanes were cut into 10 x 2\u2009mm bands using a scalpel blade and proteins were reduced , alkylated and trypsinised as described previously ( Keerthikumar et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , the gel bands were subjected to reduction by 10\u2009mM DTT ( Bio-Rad ) , alkylation by 25\u2009mM iodoacetamide ( Sigma ) , tryptic digestion overnight with 150 ng of trypsin ( Promega ) . Subsequently , the tryptic peptides were further extracted using acetonitrile ( 50% w/v ) and 0 . 1% trifluoroacetic acid ( 0 . 1% ) . Extracted tryptic peptides were concentrated to ~10\u2009\u03bcL by centrifugal lyophilisation and analysed by LC-MS/MS using LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer ( Thermo Scientific ) fitted with nanoflow reversed-phase-HPLC ( Model 1200 , Agilent ) . MGF files were generated using MSConvert using peak picking . The MGF files were searched against the NCBI RefSeq database ( RRID:AB_2085424 ) in a target decoy fashion using MASCOT ( RRID:AB_2085424\u00a0v2 . 4 , Matrix Science , UK ) . Search parameters used were: fixed modification ( carbamidomethylation of cysteine; +57 Da ) , variable modifications ( oxidation of methionine; +16 Da ) , three missed tryptic cleavages , 20 ppm peptide mass tolerance and 0 . 6 Da fragment ion mass tolerance . Peptide identifications with mascot ion score greater than the identity score were deemed significant . The relative protein abundance between the samples was obtained by estimating the ratio of normalised spectral counts ( RSc ) as previously described ( Keerthikumar et al . , 2015 ) ."}

As long as a cell is alive , it actively maintains a difference in electrical charge between its interior and exterior . This charge difference , or voltage , is called the membrane potential , and it is vital for our bodies to work properly . For example , fast changes in membrane potential control our heartbeat and underpin the electrical signals that brain cells use to communicate . Slower changes in membrane potential \u2013 ranging from minutes to days \u2013 may also play important roles in other organs . To understand how and why membrane potential is important in these contexts , we need methods to measure it accurately in individual cells . One way is to puncture cells with microscopic electrodes: this yields accurate results but damages the cells and can only measure one cell at a time . Alternative methods treat cells with special fluorescent dyes and then image them with a microscope . The dyes emit light in response to voltage variations: when the cells\u2019 membrane potential changes , the dyes glow brighter . The changes in light intensity give an estimate of the size of the change in membrane potential . This allows many cells to be analyzed without harming them , but it is less accurate . Fluorescence lifetime refers to how long fluorescent dyes take to finish emitting light , and this phenomenon has already helped researchers to record a variety of processes in the cell . Lazzari-Dean et al . therefore wanted to use fluorescence lifetime to develop a better way of recording membrane potential . This method , called VF-FLIM , relied on measuring how long certain dyes took to finish emitting light at specific voltages , rather than how bright they were . Experiments using mammalian cells grown in the laboratory showed that the membrane potentials measured with VF-FLIM were similar to those recorded with electrodes , which represent the highest standard of accuracy . The new method was at least eight times more accurate than other techniques using fluorescent dyes . VF-FLIM could also measure many thousands of cells within a few hours , a hundred times faster than electrode-based methods . Finally , tests on human cancer cells revealed that VF-FLIM could detect that these cells go through gradual changes in membrane potential in response to growth signals . VF-FLIM is a new , non-invasive tool that can measure changes in membrane potential more quickly and accurately . This will help to better understand the many roles membrane potential could play in healthy and diseased cells .", "source": "All cells maintain ionic gradients across their plasma membranes , producing transmembrane potentials ( Vmem ) . Mounting evidence suggests a relationship between resting Vmem and the physiology of non-excitable cells with implications in diverse areas , including cancer , cellular differentiation , and body patterning . A lack of non-invasive methods to record absolute Vmem limits our understanding of this fundamental signal . To address this need , we developed a fluorescence lifetime-based approach ( VF-FLIM ) to visualize and optically quantify Vmem with single-cell resolution in mammalian cell culture . Using VF-FLIM , we report Vmem distributions over thousands of cells , a 100-fold improvement relative to electrophysiological approaches . In human carcinoma cells , we visualize the voltage response to growth factor stimulation , stably recording a 10\u201315 mV hyperpolarization over minutes . Using pharmacological inhibitors , we identify the source of the hyperpolarization as the Ca2+-activated K+ channel KCa3 . 1 . The ability to optically quantify absolute Vmem with cellular resolution will allow a re-examination of its signaling roles . \n Membrane potential ( Vmem ) is an essential facet of cellular physiology . In electrically excitable cells , such as neurons and cardiomyocytes , voltage-gated ion channels enable rapid changes in membrane potential . These fast membrane potential changes , on the order of milliseconds to seconds , trigger release of neurotransmitters in neurons or contraction in myocytes . The resting membrane potentials of these cells , which change over longer timescales , affect their excitability . In non-electrically excitable cells , slower changes in Vmem\u2014on the order of seconds to hours\u2014are linked to a variety of fundamental cellular processes ( Abdul Kadir et al . , 2018 ) , including mitosis ( Cone and Cone , 1976 ) , cell cycle progression ( Huang and Jan , 2014 ) , and differentiation ( Tsuchiya and Okada , 1982 ) . Mounting lines of evidence point to the importance of electrochemical gradients in development , body patterning , and regeneration ( Levin , 2014 ) . Despite the importance of membrane potential to diverse processes over a range of time scales , the existing methods for recording Vmem are inadequate for characterizing distributions of Vmem states in a sample or studying gradual shifts in resting membrane potential ( Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . Patch clamp electrophysiology remains the gold standard for recording cellular electrical parameters , but it is low throughput , highly invasive , and difficult to implement over extended time periods . Where reduced invasiveness or higher throughput analyses of Vmem are required , optical methods for detecting events involving Vmem changes ( e . g . whether an action potential occurred ) are often employed ( Huang et al . , 2006; McKeithan et al . , 2017; Zhang et al . , 2016 ) . However , optical approaches generally use fluorescence intensity values as a readout , which cannot report either the value of Vmem in millivolts ( \u2018absolute Vmem\u2019 ) or the millivolt amount by which Vmem changed ( Peterka et al . , 2011 ) . Variations in dye environment ( Ross and Reichardt , 1979 ) , dye loading , illumination intensity , fluorophore bleaching , and/or cellular morphology complicate fluorescence intensity measurements , making calibration and determination of absolute membrane potential difficult or impossible . This limitation restricts optical analysis to detection of acute Vmem changes , which can be analyzed without comparisons of Vmem between cells or over long timescales . One strategy to address these fluorescence intensity artifacts and quantify cellular parameters optically is ratio-based imaging . For Vmem specifically , ratio-based signals can be accessed either with a two-component system or with an electrochromic voltage sensitive dye , but neither strategy has enabled accurate absolute Vmem recordings . Two-component FRET-oxonol systems , with independent chromophores for ratio-based calibration , have seen limited success ( Gonz\u00e1lez and Tsien , 1997 ) , and they confer significant capacitive load on the cell ( Briggman et al . , 2010 ) . Further , their performance hinges on carefully tuned loading procedures of multiple lipophilic indicators ( Adams and Levin , 2012 ) , which can be challenging to reproduce across different samples and days . On the other hand , electrochromic probes report voltage as changes in excitation and emission wavelengths of a single chromophore ( Loew et al . , 1979 ) . While they benefit from simpler loading procedures , signals from electrochromic styryl dyes require normalization with an electrode on each cell of interest to determine absolute Vmem accurately ( Montana et al . , 1989; Zhang et al . , 1998; Bullen and Saggau , 1999 ) . As a result , ratiometric Vmem sensors cannot be used to optically quantify slow signals in the resting Vmem , which may be on the order of tens of millivolts . Indeed , ratiometric Vmem probes are most commonly applied to detect - rather than quantify - fast changes in Vmem ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) , much like their single wavelength counterparts . An alternative approach to improved quantification in optical measurements is fluorescence lifetime ( \u03c4fl ) imaging ( FLIM ) , which measures the excited state lifetime of a population of fluorophores . Because fluorescence lifetime is an intrinsic property , FLIM can avoid many of the artifacts that confound extrinsic fluorescence intensity measurements , such as uneven dye loading , fluorophore bleaching , variations in illumination intensity , and detector sensitivity ( Berezin and Achilefu , 2010; Yellen and Mongeon , 2015 ) . If a fluorescent probe responds to the analyte of interest via changes in the lifetime of its excited state , there is the opportunity to use fluorescence lifetime to provide a more quantitative estimate of analyte parameters than can be achieved with fluorescence intensity alone . Although FLIM measurements can be affected by environmental factors such as temperature , ionic strength and local environment ( Berezin and Achilefu , 2010 ) , FLIM has been widely employed to record a number of biochemical and biophysical parameters , including intracellular Ca2+ concentration ( Zheng et al . , 2015 ) , viscosity ( Levitt et al . , 2009 ) , GTPase activity ( Harvey et al . , 2008 ) , kinase activity ( Lee et al . , 2009 ) , and redox state ( NADH/NAD+ ratio ) ( Blacker and Duchen , 2016 ) , among others ( Yellen and Mongeon , 2015 ) . Attempts to record absolute voltage with FLIM , however , have been limited in success ( Dumas and Stoltz , 2005; Hou et al . , 2014; Brinks et al . , 2015 ) . Previous work focused on genetically encoded voltage indicators ( GEVIs ) , which either possess complex relationships between \u03c4fl and voltage ( Hou et al . , 2014 ) or show low sensitivity to voltage in lifetime ( Brinks et al . , 2015 ) and require complex and technically challenging measurements of fast photochemical kinetics to estimate voltage ( Hou et al . , 2014 ) . Because of this poor voltage resolution , the fluorescence lifetimes of GEVIs cannot be used to detect most biologically relevant voltage changes , which are on the order of tens of millivolts . Fluorescent voltage indicators that use photoinduced electron transfer ( PeT ) as a voltage-sensing mechanism are promising candidates for a FLIM-based approach to optical Vmem quantification . Because PeT affects the nonradiative decay rate of the fluorophore excited state , it has been successfully translated from intensity to \u03c4fl imaging with a number of small molecule probes for Ca2+ ( Lakowicz et al . , 1992 ) . We previously established that VoltageFluor ( VF ) -type dyes transduce changes in cellular membrane potential to changes in fluorescence intensity and that the voltage response of VF dyes is consistent with a PeT-based response mechanism ( Miller et al . , 2012; Woodford et al . , 2015 ) . Changes in the transmembrane potential alter the rate of PeT ( Li , 2007; de Silva et al . , 1995 ) from an electron-rich aniline donor to a fluorescent reporter , thereby modulating the fluorescence intensity of VF dyes ( Miller et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 1A , B ) . VoltageFluors also display low toxicity and rapid , linear responses to voltage . Here , we develop fluorescence lifetime imaging of VoltageFluor dyes ( VF-FLIM ) as a quantitative , all-optical approach for recording absolute membrane potential with single cell resolution . Using patch-clamp electrophysiology as a standard , we demonstrate that VF-FLIM reports absolute membrane potential in single trials with 10 to 23 mV accuracy ( root mean square deviation , RMSD; 15 s acquisition ) , depending on the cell line . In all cases tested , VF-FLIM tracks membrane potential changes with better than 5 mV accuracy ( RMSD ) . We benchmark VF-FLIM against previously reported optical absolute Vmem recording approaches and demonstrate resolution improvements of 8-fold over ratiometric strategies and 19-fold over other lifetime-based strategies . To highlight the increased throughput relative to manual patch-clamp electrophysiology , we document resting membrane potentials of thousands of cells . To our knowledge , this work represents the first broad view of the distribution of resting membrane potentials present in situ . VF-FLIM is limited to acquisition speeds on the order of seconds , but it is well-suited for studying gradual Vmem dynamics . Using VF-FLIM , we quantify and track the evolution of a 10\u201315 mV Vmem hyperpolarization over minutes following epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) stimulation of human carcinoma cells . Through pharmacological perturbations , we conclude that the voltage changes following EGF stimulation arise from activation of the calcium-activated potassium channel KCa3 . 1 . Our results show that fluorescence lifetime of VF dyes is a generalizable and effective approach for studying resting membrane potential in a range of cell lines ( Lakowicz et al . , 1992 ) . \n To characterize how the photoinduced electron transfer process affects fluorescence lifetime , we compared the \u03c4fl of the voltage-sensitive dye VF2 . 1 . Cl with its voltage-insensitive counterpart VF2 . 0 . Cl ( Figure 1B ) . We recorded the \u03c4fl of bath-applied VF dyes in HEK293T cells using time-correlated single-photon counting ( TCSPC ) FLIM ( Figure 1C\u2013E , Scheme\u00a01 ) . VF2 . 1 . Cl is localized to the plasma membrane and exhibits a biexponential \u03c4fl decay with decay constants of approximately 0 . 9 and 2 . 6 ns ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . For all subsequent analysis of VF2 . 1 . Cl lifetime , we refer to the weighted average \u03c4fl , which is approximately 1 . 6 ns in HEK293T cell membranes at rest . VF2 . 0 . Cl ( Figure 1B ) , which lacks the aniline substitution and is therefore voltage-insensitive ( Woodford et al . , 2015 ) , shows a \u03c4fl of 3 . 5 ns in cell membranes , which is similar to the lifetime of an unsubstituted fluorescein ( Magde et al . , 1999 ) ( Figure 1\u2014source data 2 ) . We also examined VoltageFluor lifetimes at a variety of dye loading concentrations to test for concentration-dependent changes in dye lifetime , which have been reported for fluorescein derivatives ( Chen and Knutson , 1988 ) . Shortened VF lifetimes were observed at high dye concentrations ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) ; all subsequent VF-FLIM studies were conducted at dye concentrations low enough to avoid this concentration-dependent change in lifetime . To assess the voltage dependence of VoltageFluor \u03c4fl , we controlled the plasma membrane potential of HEK293T cells with whole-cell voltage-clamp electrophysiology while simultaneously measuring the \u03c4fl of VF2 . 1 . Cl ( Figure 1C ) . Single-cell recordings show a linear \u03c4fl response to applied voltage steps , and individual measurements deviate minimally from the linear fit ( Figure 1F\u2013H ) . VF2 . 1 . Cl \u03c4fl is reproducible across different cells at the same resting membrane potential , allowing determination of Vmem from \u03c4fl images taken without concurrent electrophysiology ( Figure 1I ) . Voltage-insensitive VF2 . 0 . Cl shows no \u03c4fl change in response to voltage ( Figure 1J , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) , consistent with a \u03c4fl change in VF2 . 1 . Cl arising from a voltage-dependent PeT process . In HEK293T cells , VF2 . 1 . Cl exhibits a sensitivity of 3 . 50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 08 ps/mV and a 0 mV lifetime of 1 . 77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 02 ns , corresponding to a fractional change in \u03c4fl ( \u0394\u03c4/\u03c4 ) of 22 . 4 \u00b1 0 . 4% per 100 mV . These values are in good agreement with the 27% \u0394F/F intensity change per 100 mV originally observed for VF2 . 1 . Cl ( Miller et al . , 2012; Woodford et al . , 2015 ) . Because %\u0394F/F is a fluorescence intensity-based metric , it cannot be used to measure absolute Vmem; however , agreement between %\u0394F/F and %\u0394\u03c4/\u03c4 is consistent with a PeT-based Vmem sensing mechanism in VFs . To estimate the voltage resolution of VF-FLIM , we analyzed the variability in successive measurements on the same cell ( intra-cell resolution ) and on different cells ( inter-cell resolution , see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . We estimate that the resolution for tracking and quantifying voltage changes in a single HEK293T cell is 3 . 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 4 mV ( intra-cell resolution , average RMSD from each electrophysiological calibration , Scheme 2 ) , whereas the resolution for single-trial determination of a particular HEK293T cell\u2019s absolute Vmem is 19 mV ( inter-cell resolution , RMSD of each calibration slope to the average calibration , Scheme 2 ) within a 15 s bandwidth . We compared the performance of VF-FLIM in HEK293T cells to that of two previously documented strategies for optical absolute Vmem determination . We first tested the voltage resolution of CAESR , the best previously reported GEVI for recording absolute Vmem with FLIM ( Brinks et al . , 2015 ) . Using simultaneous FLIM and voltage-clamp electrophysiology , we determined the relationship between \u03c4fl and Vmem for CAESR under one photon excitation ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . We recorded a sensitivity of \u22121 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 1 ps/mV and a 0 mV lifetime of 2 . 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 2 ns , which corresponds to a \u22126 . 1 \u00b1 0 . 8% \u0394\u03c4/\u03c4 per 100 mV ( mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM of 9 measurements ) , in agreement with the reported sensitivity of \u22120 . 9 ps/mV and 0 mV lifetime of 2 . 7 ns with 2 photon excitation ( Brinks et al . , 2015 ) . Relative to VF2 . 1 . Cl , CAESR displays 3-fold lower sensitivity ( \u22121 . 2 ps/mV vs 3 . 5 ps/mV in HEK293T cells ) and 7-fold higher voltage-independent variability in lifetime ( 0 . 46 ns vs 0 . 07 ns , standard deviation of the 0 mV lifetime measurement ) . For CAESR in HEK293T cells , we calculate a voltage resolution of 33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 mV for quantifying voltage changes on an individual cell ( intra-cell RMSD , compared to 3 . 5 mV for VF2 . 1 . Cl , see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) and resolution of 370 mV for determination of a particular cell\u2019s absolute Vmem ( inter-cell RMSD , compared to 19 mV for VF2 . 1 . Cl ) . We also measured the absolute voltage resolution of the ratio-based sensor di-8-ANEPPS , which reports membrane potential by the wavelength of its excitation and emission spectra ( Loew et al . , 1979 ) . Ratio-based imaging can be achieved by comparing the fluorescence emission at different excitation wavelengths ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) ; here , we used the ratio , R , of the blue-excited emission to the green-excited emission ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Via simultaneous ratio imaging and whole cell voltage clamp electrophysiology , we record a sensitivity of 0 . 0039\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 0004 R per mV , with a y-intercept ( 0 mV ) R value of 1 . 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 2 ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM of n\u00a0=\u00a016 HEK293T cells ) . R depends on the excitation and emission conditions used but should be relatively reproducible on a given microscope rig . To compare R from our system with previous work , we normalized all R values to the R value at 0 mV for each cell . Using the above data , we obtain a sensitivity of 0 . 0022\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 0002 normalized R per mV , with a 0 mV normalized R of 1 . 02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 02 , in good agreement with reported values ( 0 . 0015 normalized R per mV ) ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . For analysis of voltage resolution , we compare VF-FLIM to the non-normalized R , since normalization requires an electrode-based measurement for every recording and is thus not a truly optical strategy . From the non-normalized di-8-ANEPPS R , we obtain an intra-cell resolution ( RMSD ) of 18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 mV ( 5-fold less accurate than VF-FLIM ) and an inter-cell resolution ( RMSD ) of 150 mV ( 8-fold less accurate than VF-FLIM ) . The sensitivities and resolutions of VF-FLIM , CAESR , and di-8-ANEPPS in HEK293T are tabulated in Figure 1\u2014source data 3 . Because cellular resting membrane potentials and voltage changes ( e . g . action potentials ) are on the order of tens of millivolts , the resolution improvements achieved by VF-FLIM enable biologically relevant absolute Vmem recordings: impossible with previous approaches . To test the generalizability of VF-FLIM , we determined \u03c4fl-Vmem calibrations in four additional commonly used cell lines: A431 , CHO , MDA-MB-231 , and MCF-7 ( Figure 2 , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . We observe a linear \u03c4fl response in all cell lines tested . The slope ( voltage sensitivity ) and y-intercept ( 0 mV lifetime ) of the \u03c4fl-Vmem response varied slightly across cell lines , with average sensitivities of 3 . 1 to 3 . 7 ps/mV and average 0 mV lifetimes ranging from 1 . 74 to 1 . 87 ns . In all cell lines , we observed better voltage resolution for quantification of Vmem changes on a given cell versus comparisons of absolute Vmem between cells . Changes in voltage for a given cell could be quantified with resolutions at or better than 5 mV ( intra-cell resolution , Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . For absolute Vmem determination of a single cell , we observed voltage resolutions ranging from 10 to 23 mV ( inter-cell resolution , 15 s acquisition time , Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . Statistically significant differences among the cell lines tested were observed for cellular \u03c4fl-Vmem calibrations in both the slope ( One-way ANOVA with Welch\u2019s correction: F ( 4 , 23 . 07 ) =18 . 12 , p<0 . 0001 ) and average 0 mV lifetime ( One-way ANOVA: F ( 4 , 67 ) =14 . 43 , p<0 . 0001 ) . There were no statistically significant differences between A431 , CHO , and HEK293T cells ( p>0 . 05 , Games-Howell and Tukey-Kramer post hoc tests for the slope and 0 mV lifetime respectively ) . MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells showed statistically significant variability from other cell lines in slope and/or 0 mV lifetime . To verify that VF-FLIM was robust in groups of cells in addition to the isolated , single cells generally used for patch clamp electrophysiology , we determined lifetime-voltage relationships for small groups of A431 cells ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013E ) . We found that calibrations made in small groups of cells are nearly identical to those obtained on individual cells , indicating that VF-FLIM only needs to be calibrated once for a given type of cell . For pairs or groups of three cells we recorded a sensitivity of 3 . 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 2 ps/mV and a 0 mV lifetime of 1 . 78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 02 ns ( mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM of 7 cells ( 5 pairs and 2 groups of 3 ) ; values are for the entire group , not just the cell in contact with the electrode ) , which is similar to the sensitivity of 3 . 55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 08 ps/mV and 0 mV lifetime of 1 . 74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 02 ns we observe in single A431 cells . The slight reduction in sensitivity seen in cell groups is likely attributable to space clamp error , which prevents complete voltage clamp of the cell group ( Williams and Mitchell , 2008; Armstrong and Gilly , 1992 ) . Indeed , when we analyzed only the most responsive cell in the group ( in contact with the electrode ) , we obtained a slope of 3 . 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 1 ps/mV and 0 mV lifetime of 1 . 79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 02 ns , in good agreement with the single cell data . The space clamp error can be clearly visualized in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3E , where one cell in the group of 3 responded much less to the voltage command . To test whether VF-FLIM is also extensible to cells maintained with different culture conditions , we recorded lifetime-Vmem relationship in serum-starved A431 cells ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3F\u2013K ) , obtaining an average sensitivity of 3 . 6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 1 ps/mV and a 0 mV lifetime of 1 . 76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 01 ns ( n\u00a0=\u00a07; two single cells , two pairs , 3 groups of 3 cells; values are average lifetime across the whole cell group ) , in excellent agreement with the values obtained for non-serum starved cells . We also tested for concentration-dependent changes in VF lifetime in all five cell lines and in serum starvation conditions . Similar to VF2 . 1 . Cl lifetime in HEK293T cells ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , we observed shortening of VF2 . 1 . Cl lifetimes beginning between 200 and 500 nM dye in all cases ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . All subsequent experiments were carried out at VF2 . 1 . Cl concentrations well below the regime where VF concentration-dependent lifetime changes were observed . The throughput of VF-FLIM enables cataloging of resting membrane potentials of thousands of cells in only a few hours of the experimenter\u2019s time . We optically recorded resting membrane potential distributions for A431 , CHO , HEK293T , MCF-7 , and MDA-MB-231 cells using VF-FLIM ( Figure 3 , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . We report resting membrane potentials by cell group ( Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) because adjacent cells in these cultures are electrically coupled to some degree via gap junctions ( Me\u015fe et al . , 2007 ) . Each group of cells represents an independent sample for Vmem . In addition , the fluorescent signal originating from membranes of adjacent cells cannot be separated with a conventional optical microscope , so assignment of a region of membrane connecting multiple cells would be arbitrary . VF-FLIM images ( Figure 3 , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) contain spatially resolved voltage information , but caution should be employed in interpreting pixel to pixel differences in lifetime . Because VF-FLIM was calibrated here using the average plasma membrane \u03c4fl for each cell , optical Vmem should be interpreted per cell or cell group . Mean resting membrane potentials recorded by VF-FLIM range from \u221253 to \u221229 mV , depending on the cell line . These average Vmem values fall within the range reported in the literature for all of the cell lines we measured ( Figure 3\u2014source data 1 ) . We also recorded resting membrane potentials in a high K+ buffer ( 120 mM K+ , \u2018high K+ HBSS\u2019 ) , where we observed a depolarization of 15 to 41 mV , bringing the mean Vmem up to \u221226 mV to +4 mV , again depending on the cell line . Although 120 mM extracellular K+ should be strongly depolarizing , it will not necessarily produce a membrane potential of 0 mV . Because few literature reports of electrophysiological measurements in 120 mM K+ exist as a point of comparison , we obtained a rough estimate of Vmem in 6 mM extracellular K+ and 120 mM extracellular K+ using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz ( GHK ) equation ( Hodgkin and Katz , 1949 ) . Under our imaging conditions and with a broad range of possible ion permeabilities and intracellular ion concentrations , the GHK equation allows Vmem ranging from \u221291 to \u221227 mV in 6 mM extracellular K+ and \u221225 to +2 mV in 120 mM extracellular K+ ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Recorded VF-FLIM values fall well within this allowed range . Notably , although the GHK equation can determine ranges of reasonable Vmem values , GHK-based Vmem results are approximate at best because of the difficulty in obtaining accurate values of permeabilities and intracellular ion concentrations for specific cell lines . Direct measurement of Vmem , rather than theoretical calculation , is required to obtain accurate values . We thought VF-FLIM was a promising method for elucidating the roles of membrane potential in non-excitable cell signaling . Specifically , we wondered whether VF-FLIM might be well-suited to dissect conflicting reports surrounding changes in membrane potential during EGF/EGF receptor ( EGFR ) -mediated signaling . Receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) -mediated signaling is a canonical signaling paradigm for eukaryotic cells , transducing extracellular signals into changes in cellular state . Although the involvement of second messengers like Ca2+ , cyclic nucleotides , and lipids are well characterized , membrane potential dynamics and their associated roles in non-excitable cell signaling remain less well-defined . In particular , the activation of EGFR via EGF has variously been reported to be depolarizing ( Rothenberg et al . , 1982 ) , hyperpolarizing ( Pandiella et al . , 1989 ) , or electrically silent ( Moolenaar et al . , 1982; Moolenaar et al . , 1986 ) . We find that treatment of A431 cells with EGF results in a 15 mV hyperpolarization within 60\u201390 s in approximately 80% of cells ( Figure 4A\u2013C , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , followed by a slow return to baseline within 15 min ( Figure 4D\u2013F , Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 3 and 0 second acquisitions ) . The voltage response to EGF is dose-dependent , with an EC50 of 90 ng/mL ( 14 nM ) ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . Vehicle-treated cells show very little \u03c4fl change ( Figure 4A\u2013F ) . Identical experiments with voltage-insensitive VF2 . 0 . Cl ( Figure 4G\u2013H , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3 , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5 ) reveal little change in \u03c4fl upon EGF treatment , indicating the drop in \u03c4fl arises from membrane hyperpolarization . We observe the greatest hyperpolarization 1 to 3 min after treatment with EGF , which is abolished by inhibition of EGFR and ErbB2 tyrosine kinase activity with the covalent inhibitor canertinib ( Figure 4I\u2013J , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6 ) . Blockade of the EGFR kinase domain with gefitinib , a non-covalent inhibitor of EGFR , also results in a substantial decrease in the EGF-evoked hyperpolarization ( Figure 4I\u2013J , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6 ) . Together , these results indicate that A431 cells exhibit an EGF-induced hyperpolarization , which depends on the kinase activity of EGFR and persists on the timescale of minutes . Outward K+ currents could mediate EGF-induced hyperpolarization . Consistent with this hypothesis , dissipation of the K+ driving force by raising extracellular [K+] completely abolishes the typical hyperpolarizing response to EGF and instead results in a small depolarizing potential of approximately 3 mV ( Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Blockade of voltage-gated K+ channels ( Kv ) with 4-aminopyridine ( 4-AP ) prior to EGF treatment enhances the hyperpolarizing response to EGF ( Figure 5A and B , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . In contrast , blockade of Ca2+-activated K+ channels ( KCa ) with charybdotoxin ( CTX ) results in a depolarizing potential of approximately 4 mV after exposure to EGF , similar to that observed with high extracellular [K+] ( Figure 5A and B , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . TRAM-34 , a specific inhibitor of the intermediate-conductance Ca2+ activated potassium channel KCa3 . 1 ( Wulff et al . , 2000 ) , also abolishes EGF-induced hyperpolarization ( Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . CTX treatment has little effect on the resting membrane potential , while TRAM-34 or 4-AP depolarizes cells by approximately 5\u201310 mV ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . To explore the effects of other components of the EGFR pathway on EGF-induced hyperpolarization , we perturbed intra- and extracellular Ca2+ concentrations during EGF stimulation . Reduction of extracellular Ca2+ concentration did not substantially alter the EGF response ( Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F ) . However , sequestration of intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA-AM disrupts the hyperpolarization response . BAPTA-AM treated cells show a small , 4 mV depolarization in response to EGF treatment , similar to CTX-treated cells ( Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G ) . Perturbation of Ca2+ levels had little effect on the resting membrane potential ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Introduction of wortmannin ( 1 \u03bcM ) to block downstream kinase activity has no effect on the membrane potential response to EGF , while orthovanadate addition ( Na3VO4 , 100 \u03bcM ) to block phosphatase activity results in a small increase in the hyperpolarizing response ( Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1H\u2013I ) . These results support a model for EGF-EGFR mediated hyperpolarization in which RTK activity of EGFR causes release of internal Ca2+ stores to in turn open KCa channels and hyperpolarize the cell ( Figure 5C ) . \n The key advantage of VF-FLIM over previously reported optical approaches is its superior Vmem resolution . Resolution can be interpreted as stability of the \u03c4fl-Vmem calibration over time and between cells . Any factors other than Vmem that change \u03c4fl decrease resolution . VF-FLIM exhibits a 19-fold improvement in inter-cell Vmem resolution over FLIM with the GEVI CAESR ( Brinks et al . , 2015 ) and a 8-fold improvement over di-8-ANEPPS excitation ratios ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . Although all optical strategies , including VF-FLIM , have worse Vmem resolution than modern electrophysiology , the greater throughput , improved spatial resolution , and reduced invasiveness of optical strategies make them a powerful complement to electrode-based recordings . The sources of variability that reduce resolution of optical Vmem measurements are manifold , but two major contributors are membrane specificity of the stain and the complexity of the lipid environment . Nonspecific staining is fluorescence signal from anywhere other than the plasma membrane , such as contaminating intracellular staining from poorly trafficked ( CAESR ) or internalized ( ANEPPS ) sensor . In contrast , exogenously loaded VF2 . 1 . Cl exhibits little fluorescence contribution from regions other than the plasma membrane . Secondly , membrane composition and dipole potential can vary between cells and cell lines , changing the local environment of the fluorescent indicator ( Wang , 2012; Br\u00fcgger , 2014 ) . Styryl dyes like di-8-ANEPPS can respond to changes in dipole potential ( Zhang et al . , 1998; Gross et al . , 1994 ) , and VF dyes may be similarly sensitive to dipole potential . Additionally , fluorescence lifetime depends on certain environmental factors ( e . g . temperature , viscosity , ionic strength ) ( Berezin and Achilefu , 2010 ) , which may introduce variability . These parameters are usually determined by the biological system under study , and re-calibration is important if they change dramatically in an experiment . VF-FLIM , like all optical approaches , improves upon the spatial resolution of patch clamp electrophysiology . While VF-FLIM records the Vmem of an optically defined region of interest ( in this study a cell or cell group ) , electrophysiology records Vmem at an individual cell or part of a cell where the electrode makes contact , which may or may not reflect the Vmem of the entire cell or group . In this study , we interpret VF-FLIM at the whole cell level only , since that is the smallest unit in which the Vmem can be reliably calibrated by whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology . Intriguingly , there are differences in lifetime within some cells in VF-FLIM images at the pixel to pixel level . In small , mostly spherical cells under voltage clamp , one would expect uniform membrane potential ( Armstrong and Gilly , 1992 ) , so these subcellular differences are most likely noise in the measurement . We speculate that most of this pixel-to-pixel noise comes from variability in fitting the biexponential lifetime model . Lifetime estimates at each pixel are calculated from 20 to 100-fold fewer photons than the lifetime value for the entire ROI . These lower photon counts at the single pixel level produce Vmem estimates that are less precise than the Vmem estimate for the entire ROI . Collection of more photons at each pixel could likely reduce this noise but would require longer acquisition times . We also cannot fully rule out an alternative explanation that the observed subcellular variability is the result of local differences in membrane composition ( Gross et al . , 1994 ) . Vmem recordings in systems too large or too small for electrophysiological study could be an important application of VF-FLIM . Despite the improbability of Vmem compartmentalization in individual HEK293T cells , other cells with complex morphology and processes may display real , subcellular Vmem differences . In addition , delocalized Vmem patterns across tissues could in theory be stable ( Cervera et al . , 2016a ) and have been proposed to contribute to tissue development ( Levin , 2014 ) . One remaining challenge in expanding VF-FLIM to these areas is the requirement for an initial calibration with voltage clamp electrophysiology . Alternative ways to control Vmem , such as ionophores or optogenetic actuators ( Berndt et al . , 2009 ) , may prove useful in these systems . When applying VF-FLIM to tissues , the cellular specificity of the VF stain becomes a consideration , as the VF2 . 1 . Cl indicator used in this study labels all cell membranes efficiently . Looking ahead , recordings in tissue are an exciting area for future development of VF-FLIM , particularly in conjunction with cellular and sub-cellular strategies for targeting VF dyes ( Liu et al . , 2017; Grenier et al . , 2019 ) . To obtain absolute Vmem measurements with fluorescence lifetime , VF-FLIM sacrifices some of the temporal resolution of electrophysiology or intensity-based voltage imaging . VF-FLIM acquisition times are limited by the large numbers of photons needed per pixel in time-correlated single photon counting ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . As a result , VF-FLIM in its current implementation can track Vmem events lasting longer than a few seconds . For \u2018resting\u2019 membrane potential or Vmem dynamics associated with cell growth or differentiation , this temporal resolution is likely sufficient . Nevertheless , in the future , we envision allying VF-FLIM with recently developed , faster lifetime imaging technology to enable optical quantification of more rapid Vmem responses ( Raspe et al . , 2015; Gao et al . , 2014 ) . Using the improved Vmem resolution and throughput of VF-FLIM , we optically documented resting membrane potential distributions in cultured cells to characterize the membrane potential state ( s ) present . The presence and significance of distinct Vmem states in cell populations is mostly uncharacterized due to the throughput limitations of patch-clamp electrophysiology , but some reports suggest that distinct Vmem states arise during the various phases of the cell cycle ( Ouadid-Ahidouch et al . , 2001; Wonderlin et al . , 1995 ) . Vmem histograms presented in this work appear more or less unimodal , showing no clear sign of cell cycle-related Vmem states ( Figure 3A , D; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A , D , G ) . We considered the possibility that VF-FLIM does not detect cell-cycle-related Vmem states because we report average Vmem across cell groups in cases where cells are in contact ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This explanation is unlikely for two reasons . First , Vmem distributions for CHO cells appear unimodal , even though CHO cultures were mostly comprised of isolated cells under the conditions tested ( Figure 3D\u2013F ) . Second , theoretical work suggests that dramatically different Vmem states in adjacent cells are unlikely , as electrical coupling often leads to equilibration of Vmem across the cell group ( Cervera et al . , 2016a; Cervera et al . , 2016b ) . Although we cannot rule out the possibility of poorly separated Vmem populations ( i . e . with a mean difference in voltage below our resolution limit ) , VF-FLIM both prompts and enables a re-examination of the notion that bi- or multimodal Vmem distributions exist in cultured cells . Furthermore , VF-FLIM represents an exciting opportunity to experimentally visualize theorized Vmem patterns in culture and in more complex tissues . Studies towards this end are ongoing in our laboratory . In the present study , we use VF-FLIM to provide the first cell-resolved , direct visualization of voltage changes induced by growth factor signaling . For long term Vmem recordings during growth-related processes , an optical approach is more attractive than an electrode-based one . Electrophysiology becomes increasingly challenging as time scale lengthens , especially if cells migrate , and washout of the cytosol with pipette solution can change the very signals under study ( Horn and Korn , 1992; Malinow and Tsien , 1990 ) . Previous attempts to electrophysiologically record Vmem in EGF-stimulated A431 cells were unsuccessful due to these technical challenges ( Pandiella et al . , 1989 ) . Because whole cell voltage-clamp electrophysiology was intractable , the Vmem response in EGF-stimulated A431 cells was addressed indirectly through model cell lines expressing EGFR exogenously ( Pandiella et al . , 1989 ) , bulk measurements on trypsinized cells in suspension ( Magni et al . , 1991 ) , or cell-attached single channel recordings ( Peppelenbosch et al . , 1991; L\u00fcckhoff and Clapham , 1994; Mozhayeva et al . , 1989 ) . By stably recording Vmem during EGF stimulation , VF-FLIM enables direct study of Vmem signaling in otherwise inaccessible pathways . In conjunction with physiological manipulations and pharmacological perturbations , we explore the molecular mechanisms underlying EGF-induced hyperpolarization . We find that signaling along the EGF-EGFR axis results in a robust hyperpolarizing current carried by K+ ions , passed by the Ca2+-activated K+ channel KCa3 . 1 , and mediated by intracellular Ca2+ ( Figure 5C ) . We achieve a complete loss of the hyperpolarizing response to EGF by altering the K+ driving force ( \u2018High K+\u2019 Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B ) , blocking calcium-activated K+ currents directly ( \u2018CTX\u2019 and \u2018TRAM-34\u2019 , Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D , E ) , or intercepting cytosolic Ca2+ ( \u2018BAPTA-AM\u2019 , Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G ) . These results , combined with transcriptomic evidence that KCa3 . 1 is the major KCa channel in A431 cells ( Thul et al . , 2017 ) , indicate that KCa3 . 1 mediates the observed hyperpolarization . Interestingly , under some conditions where K+-mediated hyperpolarization is blocked ( \u2018CTX , \u2019 \u2018high K+' , \u2018BAPTA-AM\u2019 ) , VF-FLIM reveals a small , secondary depolarizing current not visible during normal EGF stimulation . This current likely arises from initial Ca2+ entry into the cell , as previously observed during EGF signaling ( Pandiella et al . , 1987; Marqu\u00e8ze-Pouey et al . , 2014 ) . Although we have obtained direct and conclusive evidence of EGF-induced hyperpolarization in A431 cells , the interactions between this voltage change and downstream targets of EGFR remain incompletely characterized . Enhancing EGF signaling by blockade of cellular tyrosine phosphatases with orthovanadate ( Reddy et al . , 2016 ) correspondingly increases EGF-mediated hyperpolarization ( \u2018Na3VO4\u2019 Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1H ) , but inhibition of downstream kinase activity appears to have little effect on hyperpolarization ( \u2018wortmannin\u2019 Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1I ) . In the context of RTK signaling , Vmem may serve to modulate the driving force for external Ca2+ entry ( Huang and Jan , 2014; Yang and Brackenbury , 2013 ) and thereby act as a regulator of this canonical signaling ion . Alternatively , Vmem may play a more subtle biophysical role , such as potentiating lipid reorganization in the plasma membrane ( Zhou et al . , 2015 ) . Small changes in Vmem likely affect signaling pathways in ways that are currently completely unknown , but high throughput discovery of Vmem targets remains challenging . Combination of electrophysiology with single cell transcriptomics has begun to uncover relationships between Vmem and other cellular pathways in excitable cells ( Cadwell et al . , 2016 ) ; such approaches could be coupled to higher throughput VF-FLIM methods to explore pathways that interact with Vmem in non-excitable contexts . VF-FLIM represents a novel and general approach for interrogating the roles of membrane potential in fundamental cellular physiology . Future improvements to the voltage resolution could be made by use of more sensitive indicators , which may exhibit larger changes in fluorescence lifetime ( Woodford et al . , 2015 ) . VF-FLIM can be further expanded to include the entire color palette of PeT-based voltage indicators ( Huang et al . , 2015; Deal et al . , 2016 ) , allied with targeting methods to probe absolute membrane potential in heterogeneous cellular populations ( Liu et al . , 2017; Grenier et al . , 2019 ) , and coupled to high-speed imaging techniques for optical quantification of fast voltage events ( Raspe et al . , 2015; Gao et al . , 2014 ) ."}

We would prefer eating a given taste if it did not cause any negative feelings after eating it for the first time; however , we would avoid eating that specific taste if it caused any digestive discomfort . This ability to connect sensory events that happen close in time is called associative learning . One longstanding theory of associative learning suggests that if the neurons that are activated by a taste fire at the same time as those that control nausea , the connections between the two groups of neurons are strengthened . This helps that particular taste to become associated with the feeling of illness . Animals can also link events that are separated in time \u2013 for example , they can become averse to a food even when its ill effects are felt several hours after eating it . An important question is how a new event ( such as a new food ) is internally represented and maintained for a certain time so that it associates with a response ( sickness ) that occurs much later . One method used to investigate associative learning is to feed rats a new food , and then later make them feel nauseous to measure how much this causes them to avoid the food in the future . The gustatory cortex is the part of the brain responsible for perceiving taste . Chinnakkaruppan and Rosenblum now use this experimental method to investigate the molecular mechanisms in the gustatory cortex that enable the internal representation ( or memory trace ) of a new taste to be associated with an unwell feeling that occurs much later . The results of the experiments show that rats will avoid food with a certain flavor if they feel unwell within eight hours of eating it . However , the response of the rats differs depending on when the rat becomes ill . Underpinning these behaviors is the formation of two parallel internal representations of the new taste: a short-term , robust trace that lasts for three hours; and a parallel , longer lasting , weaker trace that lasts for eight hours to associate the taste with its outcome . The weaker , longer-lasting memory trace only forms if the shorter , stronger trace also occurs . Chinnakkaruppan and Rosenblum found that forming the shorter , stronger memory requires the activity of a signaling pathway in the gustatory cortex that involves biochemical molecules called NMDAR-CaMKII-GluA1 . These molecules can increase the strength of signaling between neurons and are already implicated in learning and memory . The next challenge is to put this newly identified molecular mechanism within the relevant neural circuit in the gustatory cortex .", "source": "Events separated in time are associatively learned in trace conditioning , recruiting more neuronal circuits and molecular mechanisms than in delay conditioning . However , it remains unknown whether a given sensory memory trace is being maintained as a unitary item to associate . Here , we used conditioned taste aversion learning in the rat model , wherein animals associate a novel taste with visceral nausea , and demonstrate that there are two parallel memory traces of a novel taste: a short-duration robust trace , lasting approximately 3\u2009hr , and a parallel long-duration weak one , lasting up to 8\u2009hr , and dependent on the strong trace for its formation . Moreover , only the early robust trace is maintained by a NMDAR-dependent CaMKII- AMPAR pathway in the insular cortex . These findings suggest that a memory trace undergoes rapid modifications , and that the mechanisms underlying trace associative learning differ when items in the memory are experienced at different time points . \n Association between events in time and space is a major mechanism for all animals , including humans , to learn about the world , which can potentially change their behavior in future circumstances . The most influential books concerning learning theory published early in the 20th century were Animal Intelligence ( 1911 ) , wherein Thorndike proposed that the rate of learning diminishes as the interval between response and discomfort/satisfaction is increased ( Thorndike , 1911 ) , and Conditioned Reflexes ( 1927 ) , wherein Pavlov highlighted that a connection is formed in the nervous system , not between a conditioned stimulus ( CS ) and unconditioned stimulus ( US ) separated in time , but between the sensory aftereffects , i . e . , trace of the CS , and the US ( Pavlov , 1927 ) . Thus , in essence , these theories mention that temporal contiguity has a vital influence on associative learning . The prevailing dogma for cellular mechanisms underlying associative learning is based on modifications of Hebb\u2019s pioneering cell assembly theory ( 1949 ) which posits that \u2018cells which fire together , wire together' , and thus the firing cells epitomize the internal representations of the two sensory events related in time ( Hebb , 1949; Miltner et al . , 1999; Nabavi et al . , 2014; Yiu et al . , 2014; Johansen et al . , 2014 ) . Indeed , it has been shown that at least in certain cases , selective facilitation of densely connected neurocircuits through excitability and/or synaptic plasticity , as a result of an experience , constitutes the basis for learning and memory ( Nabavi et al . , 2014; Yiu et al . , 2014; Johansen et al . , 2014 ) . Most of these studies have examined the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying trace associative learning processes using classical conditioning paradigms in which the association takes place within the timescale of msec to sec ( Johansen et al . , 2014; Kitamura et al . , 2014; Beylin et al . , 2001 ) . However , evolution has produced other type ( s ) of associative learning , wherein the CS and US can be experienced several minutes to hours apart . For example , the inter-time-interval ( ITI ) between the CS ( novel taste ) and the US ( visceral information ) in the conditioned taste aversion ( CTA ) paradigm can last for hours ( Garcia et al . , 1955; 1985; Kalat and Rozin , 1971; 1973; Chambers , 1990; Rosenblum et al . , 1993; 1997; Yamamoto et al . , 1995; Hashikawa et al . , 2013; Adaikkan and Rosenblum , 2012; Stern et al . , 2013; Inberg et al . , 2013; Chinnakkaruppan et al . , 2014; Parkes et al . , 2014; Sano et al . , 2014 ) . Here , we attempted to understand the mechanisms that enable the taste memory trace to be associated with visceral information after such a long time . \n In order to evaluate the effect of the ITI between taste and malaise in CTA learning ( ITI-CTA ) quantitatively and qualitatively , we conducted a behavioral experiment , in which rats were presented with a novel taste ( 0 . 1% saccharin; CS ) and later were i . p . injected with lithium chloride ( 0 . 14\u00a0M LiCl; US ) at increasing time points ranging between 1\u2009hr and 20\u2009hr ( Figure 1A ) . In agreement with previous findings , we found that CTA was acquired after separating the taste and malaise stimuli for up to 8\u2009hr but not 20\u2009hr ( Figure 1B , Figure 1\u2014source data 1 and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) ( Kalat and Rozin , 1971; Kalat and Rozin , 1973; Rozin and Kalat , 1971; Revusky , 1971; Guti\u00e9rrez et al . , 2003; Koh et al . , 2009; Chinnakkaruppan et al . , 2014 ) . Interestingly , non-parametric cluster analysis revealed that there are two different clusters among 1\u20138\u2009hr ITI-CTAs: 1\u20133\u2009hr ( hereinafter short-trace ) and 4\u20138\u2009hr ( hereinafter long-trace ) ITI-CTAs ( Figure 1B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07582 . 003Figure 1 .

There are two different clusters among 1\u20138\u2009hr ITI-CTA groups: short-trace ( 1\u20133\u2009hr ITI-CTAs ) and long-trace ( 4\u20138\u2009hr ITI-CTAs ) . ( C ) 1\u20133\u2009hr ITI-CTA groups exhibited a similar pattern of extinction and reached AI similar to control group by Test7 whereas 4\u20138\u2009hr ITI-CTA groups extinguished CTA memory by Test4 .

( A ) The control group from the main Figure 1B , which exhibited taste aversion of about 36% upon the second taste encounter ( Test1 ) , demonstrated less aversion on the third taste encounter ( paired t-test between Test1 and Test2; T = 4 . 781 , p=0 . 001 ) . Upper panel depicts the experimental design . ( B ) Rats demonstrated high aversion to a novel palatable taste upon sampling for the first time . This is referred to as neophobia , i . e . , reluctance to consume a novel taste due to lack of knowledge regarding the post-ingestive consequences . However , rats exhibited less aversion upon the second and third encounter , demonstrating that taste preference is an adaptive process . This phenomenon is called attenuation of neophobia . Each line represents a rat and a dotted line is a mean of the group ( one way ANOVA; F ( 1 . 427 , 14 . 273 ) = 27 . 925 , p=0 . 00003 . Bonferroni post hoc test , between Test1 and Test2 p=0 . 004; Test2 and Test3 p=0 . 009; and Test1 and Test3 p=0 . 0003 ) . ( C ) As expected , the CTA control group upon Test1 ( i . e . second time consumption of the novel taste ) did not differ from Test2 of attenuation of neophobia group ( T ( 19 ) = 0 . 954 , p=0 . 352 ) , indicating that ingesting a taste only once is not sufficient to determine that the taste is completely safe to consume and thus rats need to ingest the same taste at least three times to form a memory that the taste is completely safe . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07582 . 005 Consistent with the retrieval results , long-trace ( 4\u20138\u2009hr ) CTA groups exhibited a similar faster CTA extinction pattern , whereas short-trace ( 1\u20133\u2009hr ) CTAs exhibited a slower extinction . The long-trace CTAs were not different from an unpaired control group by extinction day4 , in comparison with day7 aversion index ( AI ) in short-trace CTAs ( Figure 1C and Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . Reverse conditioning did not lead to taste aversion ( Figure 1E ) , which indicates the importance of temporal order between taste and nausea in CTA learning . The strength of an association can be affected by ITI between CS and US or by the strength of US . We thus conducted an ITI-CTA with a weak US ( 0 . 025M LiCl ) to test whether weaker CTA learning can be acquired when an association is made during the short- ( 1\u20133\u2009hr ) but not the long-trace ( 4\u20138\u2009hr ) intervals . We found that CTA was formed following the short-trace intervals , and interestingly , also following a 4\u2009hr but not 5\u2009hr trace interval . Together these results suggest that there is a shift in the associability of the taste memory trace at around 3\u20134\u2009hr after exposure to the taste stimulus ( Figure 1D ) . The long ITI between CS and US in CTA is reasonable from physiological , ecological , and evolutionary perspectives . The minutes to hours process of digestion followed by absorption may dictate the animal to associate between the taste consumed and its delayed physiological consequences ( for more information see reviews , Gal-Ben-Ari and Rosenblum , 2012; Kong and Singh , 2008 ) . It is possible that depending on the ITI there are two taste memory traces ( as indicated by the behavioral readout ) : the first one is strong , but lasts for approximately 3\u2009hr ( short-trace ) , whereas the second trace is weak , but lasts for up to 8\u2009hr ( long-trace ) . This observation is further supported by the previous demonstration that micro-injection of the protein synthesis inhibitor , anisomycin , into the insular cortex ( IC ) within 3\u2009hr but not 4\u2009hr after the taste inhibits associative taste memory in the latent inhibition of CTA paradigm ( Merhav and Rosenblum , 2008 ) . It is therefore plausible to hypothesize that the underlying biological mechanism ( s ) of taste-nausea association may differ between short- and long-trace CTAs . Next , we set out to test this hypothesis . Given ample evidence that novel taste experience impacts the phospho-proteome in the IC ( see reviews , Adaikkan and Rosenblum , 2012; Gal-Ben-Ari and Rosenblum , 2012 ) and the idea that calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) has the potential to store information ( Lisman , 2014 and the references therein ) , we aimed to test the possibility that CaMKII\u03b1 , through auto-phosphorylation ( at T286; which can act as a molecular positive feedback loop ) , maintains the taste memory trace in the IC . Moreover , we were encouraged by the previous report that showed that novel taste consumption increases CaMKII\u03b1 expression in the IC ( Belelovsky et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , we followed up this finding and expanded it by measuring the phosphorylation/expression levels of CaMKII\u03b1 in the IC for up to 8\u2009hr after the consumption of novel taste . We subjected IC samples of rats exposed to either water or novel taste solution ( 0 . 1% saccharin ) to biochemical fractionation ( Stern et al . , 2013 ) , and examined the phosphorylation and expression levels of CaMKII\u03b1 in the crude synaptosomal fraction ( P2-fraction ) by Western-blotting analysis ( Figure 2A\u2013C and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We replicated the finding from the previous report ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , that 15\u00a0min after novel taste consumption , CaMKII\u03b1 expression is increased in the IC . Interestingly , we observed that the T286 phosphorylation of CaMKII\u03b1 ( pT286CaMKII\u03b1 ) was increased in the P2-fraction 30\u00a0min following novel taste consumption , persisting for up to 3\u2009hr ( 1 and 3\u2009hr ) , but not 5 or 8\u2009hr afterwards ( Figure 2D , E and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 , 2 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07582 . 006Figure 2 .

( E ) Novel taste groups showed increased pT286CaMKII\u03b1 levels in the IC synaptosomal fraction at 0 . 5 , 1 , and 3\u2009hr compared to water controls . 5 and 8\u2009hr groups showed no difference in pT286CaMKII\u03b1 levels between water and novel taste groups .

Rats were injected with saline or MK801 30\u00a0min before they were exposed to water or novel taste , and 1\u2009hr later were sacrificed and IC was extracted .

MK801-injected groups which received novel taste did not differ from the water group but expressed significantly less phosphorylated CaMKII\u03b1 ( pT286 ) than novel taste group injected with saline .

( B ) Consistent with a previous report ( Belelovsky et al . , 2005 ) , novel taste experience significantly increased total CaMKII\u03b1 compared to water controls ( T ( 10 ) = -2 . 273 , p=0 . 046 ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07582 . 010 There was no significant difference in T305 phosphorylation of CaMKII\u03b1 ( pT305CaMKII\u03b1; a phosphorylation site which prevents calcium/calmodulin activation of CaMKII ) between water control and novel taste groups at any time point ( Figure 2D\u2013G and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 , 2 ) . Intriguingly , the temporal dynamics of pT286CaMKII\u03b1 in the IC after the novel taste experience corresponds to the short-trace timescale , indicating a possible link between CaMKII\u03b1 and short-trace CTA learning . It is possible that NMDAR activation is upstream to CaMKII\u03b1 phosphorylation , because activation of NMDAR in the IC is crucial for taste-malaise association and NMDAR regulates CaMKII\u03b1 phosphorylation ( Rosenblum et al . , 1997; Ferreira et al . , 2002; Sanhueza et al . , 2011; Halt et al . , 2012; Parkes et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , we examined if NMDAR activation is necessary for novel taste-dependent CaMKII\u03b1 activation . Indeed , novel taste experience-induced phosphorylation of T286CaMKII\u03b1 is NMDAR-dependent , since i . p . injection of the NMDAR antagonist , MK801 ( 0 . 2\u00a0mg/kg b . w ) , 30\u00a0min before novel taste learning precluded phosphorylation of T286CaMKII\u03b1 in the IC ( Figure 2H , I and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . pT305CaMKII\u03b1 and total CaMKII\u03b1 levels did not differ among the water group injected with saline and the novel taste groups injected with either saline or MK801 ( Figure 2J , K and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Taste memory trace can persist for an association , and at the very same time can undergo sensory information processing to form incidental taste learning ( Chinnakkaruppan et al . , 2014; Rosenberg et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , the correlation between the consumption of novel taste and NMDAR-dependent T286CaMKII\u03b1 phosphorylation can serve the taste memory trace for an association , and/or incidental taste memory . In order to dissociate between these possibilities , we investigated the role of NMDAR and CaMKII\u03b1 in non-associative incidental and associative CTA learning by micro-infusing the NMDAR antagonist APV ( 10\u00a0\u03bcg/1\u00a0\u03bcl/hemisphere ) or CaMKII\u03b1 inhibitor TatCN21 ( 0 . 3\u00a0nM/1\u00a0\u03bcl/ hemisphere ( Buard et al . , 2010 ) ) bilaterally into the IC . Consistent with the literature , our data reveal that NDMAR in the IC is dispensable for incidental taste learning but necessary for CTA learning ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) ( Rosenblum et al . , 1997; Barki-Harrington et al . , 2009; Parkes et al . , 2014 ) . We also found that CaMKII\u03b1 in the IC is dispensable for incidental taste learning but necessary for CTA learning ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 , 2 ) . Given that NMDAR-dependent T286CaMKII\u03b1 phosphorylation in the IC is required specifically for CTA , we sought to test whether NMDAR-CaMKII\u03b1 signaling in the IC maintains the taste memory trace for the association with the US by infusing the respective antagonist or inhibitor into the IC at various time points between the CS and US . We micro-injected the NMDAR antagonist into the IC 25\u2009min from the beginning of the taste consumption in 1\u2009hr ITI-CTA conditioning with a weak US and observed an attenuated CTA memory , consistent with a previous report in which a strong US was administered ( Rosenblum et al . , 1997; but also see Ferreira et al . , 2002 ) ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A ) . Intriguingly , we did not observe any effect when we made a similar manipulation in the IC 4\u2009hr after the taste consumption in 5\u2009hr ITI-CTA conditioning with a strong US ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B; all the remaining experiments were done with a strong US ) . Next , we micro-injected CaMKII\u03b1 inhibitor TatCN21 or Tat control ( Tatcont ) into the IC 25\u00a0min from the beginning of the taste consumption in short-trace 3\u2009hr ITI-CTA conditioning , and observed an attenuated CTA memory ( Figure 3B and Figure 3\u2014source data 1 ) . We micro-injected TatCN21 into the IC 25\u00a0min ( i . e . short-trace timescale ) from the beginning of the taste consumption in the long-trace 5\u2009h ITI-CTA conditioning , and also observed an attenuated CTA memory ( Figure 3C ) . However , consistent with the temporal dynamics of CaMKII\u03b1 phosphorylation in the IC , CaMKII\u03b1 inhibition in the IC 4\u2009h after the taste consumption in the long-trace 5\u2009hr ITI-CTA conditioning had no effect on CTA memory ( Figure 3D ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07582 . 011Figure 3 .

In order to test the possibility that the effects produced by TatCN21 in Figures 3B , C are attributable to an increase in the short term learning about the safety of the taste rather than disruption in taste-LiCl association , we conducted a behavioral experiment in which rats were presented with a novel taste and at various time intervals ranging from 1\u20138\u2009hr were tested for their preference to the pre-exposed taste . We later investigated whether short-term taste memory is amenable to perturbation of CaMKII\u03b1 in the IC . ( A ) Outline of the behavioral experiment . Following habituation rats were exposed to novel taste and 1 , 3 , 5 , and 8\u2009hr later they were subjected to a taste choice test and the aversion index was calculated . ( B ) Interestingly , 5 and 8\u2009hr groups exhibited less aversion and were significantly lower than both 1\u2009hr and na\u00efve preference ( NP ) groups ( Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA; n = 11 rats/group; X2 ( 4 , n = 55 ) = 25 . 162 , p<0 . 0001; Post-hoc test compared to NP group , 1\u2009hr , p=0 . 884; 3\u2009hr , p=0 . 199; 5\u2009hr , p=0 . 018; 8\u2009h , p=0 . 002 .

( D , E ) The decreased AI to the pre-exposed taste as shown in A and B cannot be attributed to the difference in the fluid consumption as revealed by the negative relationship between saccharin and water consumption with the preference index ( MANOVA; Pillai's trace , general interaction; F ( 8 , 100 ) = 9 . 438 , p<0 . 001; Saccharin volume consumption , F ( 4 , 50 ) = 16 . 198 , p<0 . 0001; Post-hoc Tukey's HSD , compared to na\u00efve preference group , 1\u2009hr , p= 0 . 528; 3\u2009hr , p<0 . 177; 5\u2009hr , p=0 . 004; 8\u2009hr , p<0 . 0001; compared to 1\u2009hr group , 3\u2009hr , p= 0 . 003; 5\u2009hr , p<0 . 001; 8\u2009hr , p<0 . 0001 .

( F ) Infusion of CaMKII\u03b1 inhibitor TatCN21 into the IC 30\u00a0min before taste consumption had no effect on the short term incidental taste memory ( t-test; n = Tatcont , 9 and TatCN21 , 8; T ( 15 ) = 0 . 388 , p=0 . 704 ) . Upper panel depicts the conditioning trial and the syringe represents microinfusion . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07582 . 016 These results indicate that novel taste consumption induces NMDAR-dependent T286CaMKII\u03b1 phosphorylation in the IC , which is necessary for maintaining the short taste memory trace for the association with visceral information . If this is the case , then inhibiting CaMKII 2\u2009hr after novel taste consumption in 3\u2009hr ITI-CTA should still impede the CS-US association . To answer this , we performed a 3\u2009hr ITI-CTA experiment in which we micro-infused CaMKII\u03b1 inhibitor TatCN21 2\u2009hr after the taste consumption , and administered the LiCl 1\u2009hr later . We observed a small non-significant effect ( Figure 3E ) . It is thus more likely that T286CaMKII\u03b1 phosphorylation in the IC is necessary for the development of the taste memory trace for the association and downstream target/s play a vital role in maintaining the taste memory trace for the CS-US association . CaMKII-dependent modulation of GluA1-containing AMPA receptors and GluN2B-containing NMDARs has been implicated in different forms of learning , memory and synaptic plasticity , and can induce changes in synaptic strength ( Hayashi et al . , 2000; Whitlock et al . , 2006; Sanhueza et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , we investigated whether pT286CaMKII\u03b1 modulates GluA1 and/or GluN2B phosphorylation/expression in the IC after novel taste experience . Indeed , experiencing novel taste increased total GluA1 but not pS831GluA1 or pS1303GluN2B in the synaptosomal fraction in the IC 1\u2009hr later ( Figure 4A and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Linear regression analysis revealed a positive correlation between pT286CaMKII\u03b1 and GluA1 expression in animals sampling novel taste ( Figure 4B and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07582 . 017Figure 4 .

Schematic representation of the conceptual parallel taste-memory trace model . ( A ) When an animal feels no negative visceral consequence after eating a novel taste , it forms a long term safe taste memory . However , when it encounters nausea , it forms an associative aversive taste memory ( CTA ) . The strength of the CS or the US or the time lapse between the two or other sensory cues at the time of learning can affect the formation of the internal representation . Here , we focused on the variable of ITI between the CS and US . ( B ) In the present model we aim to explain the temporal constraints and biological mechanisms underlying trace-CTA . Using sodium saccharin as CS and 0 . 14M LiCl as strong US we found that the novel taste memory trace is generated after the consumption of novel taste , and lasts for approximately 8\u2009hr to associate with its outcome . The associability of the taste memory trace changes at around 4\u2009hr after the novel taste consumption with the US . Taken together , the behavioral readout with different ITIs and pharmacological manipulations of the NMDAR-CaMKII\u03b1-GluA1 axis in the IC using different ITI-CTA training , we reason that there are two parallel taste memory traces with different underlying mechanisms: one that is robust but decays quickly ( strong-trace; solid blue line ) and the second trace , which is weak but lasts longer ( weak-trace; dashed blue line ) . X-axis depicts the time in hours between the taste and malaise . Y-axis indicates the strength of the associable taste memory trace . It is possible that the weak taste-memory trace is parallel to that of the strong taste-memory trace or independent of the strong trace . Given our findings that different pharmacological manipulations in the insular cortex ( APV , TatCN21 , CNQX ) affect the associability of the taste-memory trace when applied only during the strong-trace timescale but not in the weak taste-memory trace timescale ( longer than 3\u2009hr ) , we suggest that the weak-taste memory trace is parallel to that of the strong one . ( C ) Finally , we add the dimension of additional information registered during the association phase by additional brain areas . We propose a multiple memory systems/trace theory , which posits that CTA learning may engage multiple memory systems to take part in the long-trace associative process and that after experiencing the taste , the NMDA receptor-dependent CaMKII\u03b1 and GluA1 pathway in the insular cortex plays a critical role only during the short-trace , whereas NMDA receptors in the hippocampus play a crucial role as the time increases ( Chinnakkaruppan et al . , 2014 ) , for the association with the US . Note that the background information/experience exists right from the CS stimulus experience but arguably they accumulate more with time . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07582 . 023 To examine whether pT286CaMKII\u03b1 is required for the increased GluA1 expression in the P2-fraction after the taste consumption , we micro-infused CaMKII\u03b1 inhibitor TatCN21 into the IC 30\u00a0min before novel taste exposure and measured GluA1 expression 1\u2009hr later . TatCN21 application reduced novel taste experience-dependent GluA1 expression in the P2-fraction ( Figure 4C and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Moreover , NMDAR antagonist MK801 injection 30\u00a0min before the novel taste also reduced GluA1 expression ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3 ) , indicating that NMDAR- and CaMKII\u03b1-dependent increased synaptic expression of GluA1 in the IC mediates short-trace taste memory for the association with the US . If indeed GluA1 in the IC mediates the taste memory trace for the association , we hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition of AMPAR following taste experience would interfere with the association with the US . Microinjection of AMPAR antagonist , CNQX , ( 1\u00a0\u03bcl/hemisphere; 3\u00a0nM/\u03bcl ) ( Tse et al . , 2011 ) into the IC 1\u2009hr after the taste consumption in short-trace 3\u2009hr ITI-CTA conditioning attenuated the CTA memory ( Figure 4D ) . Interestingly , CNQX micro-injection into the IC 2\u2009hr after the taste consumption in 3\u2009hr ITI-CTA learning also attenuated CTA memory ( Figure 4E ) . Furthermore , microinjection of CNQX into the IC 1\u2009hr ( short-trace timescale ) after the taste consumption in long-trace 5\u2009hr ITI-CTA conditioning also attenuated the CTA memory ( Figure 4F ) . However , in accordance with the timescale of short-trace and CaMKII\u03b1-GluA1 activation , we found that CNQX micro-injection 4\u2009hr after novel taste consumption in 5\u2009hr ITI-CTA had no effect on CTA ( Figure 4G ) . It is intriguing that the inhibition of CaMKII\u03b1 or AMPAR in the IC during short-trace timescale attenuated short-trace CTA memory . In addition , inhibition of the CaMKII\u03b1-GluA1 pathway during short-trace timescale also attenuated long-trace CTA . However , long-trace CTA was not affected when CaMKII\u03b1-GluA1 pathway in the IC was left intact for 3\u2009hr . Together , these data reveal that there are two parallel taste memory traces which are subserved by different mechanisms: one that is robust but decays quickly , and another which is weak but lasts longer . It is important to note that NMDAR-CaMKII\u03b1-AMPAR in the IC are not necessary for incidental taste learning and memory , whereas muscarinic receptors are critical for incidental taste learning ( Ferreira et al . , 2002; Parkes et al . , 2014 ) . It is interesting that different molecular mechanisms take place in the same cortex , the insular cortex , to mediate associative and non-associative taste learning and memory . We should emphasize that different pharmacological manipulation ( APV , TatCN21 , CNQX ) in the IC when applied within 3\u2009hr after the CS presentation only modifies but not completely erases the CTA memory . It is also noteworthy that several previous reports demonstrate that pharmacological perturbations in the IC during CTA conditioning only partially disrupt CTA memory , and that the disrupted CTA appears similar to long-trace CTA memory ( Rosenblum et al . , 1993; Rosenblum et al . , 1997; Berman et al . , 2000; Eisenberg et al . , 2003; Guti\u00e9rrez et al . , 2003; Barki-Harrington et al . , 2009; Inberg et al . , 2013; Stern et al . , 2013; Parkes et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , it is possible that over time , there is a transformation from the taste memory trace dominance ( i . e . short-trace ) and IC dependency to multiple memory traces ( i . e . during long-trace ) due to the multi-channeled background experience , e , g . , time , space , food digestion-dependent body physiology , etc . Such transformation , which involves multiple memory traces , for instance , episodic memory trace ( how long ago the taste was consumed and under what context ? ) , may result in a wider distribution and processing of the taste memory trace with the passage of time ( Kalat and Rozin , 1971; Revusky , 1971; Kalat and Rozin , 1973; Koh et al . , 2009; Chinnakkaruppan et al . , 2014 ) . Since the initial demonstration of CTA by Garcia ( 1955 ) , several studies have proposed that the reduced aversion index followed by the increased interval between the taste and malaise in CTA conditioning could be attributed to ( i ) the learned safety about the taste , ( ii ) accumulating background interference , and ( iii ) taste memory trace decay ( Kalat and Rozin , 1971; Rozin and Kalat , 1971; Revusky , 1971; Kalat and Rozin , 1973; Guti\u00e9rrez et al . , 2003; Koh et al . , 2009; Chinnakkaruppan et al . , 2014 ) . First , in support of the learned safety theory , and in line with the previous reports , we found that animals exhibit higher preference to the taste hours following the first-time experience ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4 ) ( Kalat and Rozin , 1973; Guti\u00e9rrez et al . , 2003 ) . Second , with regards to background interference theory , we propose that the multi-channeled background information can be viewed as episodic components and that , for example , the hippocampus is critical to assimilate the episodic component in CTA ( Chinnakkaruppan et al . , 2014; Koh et al . , 2009 ) . Third , in line with the trace decay theory , our findings demonstrate that the robust short-trace fades within 3\u2009hr in the IC but the long-trace , which is weak , lasts longer . Moreover , the non-linear decay of the short trace suggests that it dominates over the long trace , so that and when the former fades , the latter is revealed ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5 ) . We propose a multiple memory trace theory , wherein we suggest that CTA learning may engage multiple memory systems to take part in the long-trace associative process and that after experiencing the taste , the IC plays a critical role during short-trace ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5 ) . Although multiple lines of evidence support that NMDAR-CaMKII-AMPAR signaling in the IC plays a crucial role in maintaining the short-trace for the association with the US , we do not rule out the possibility that other molecular mechanisms in the IC may participate as well in the long-trace CTA . For instance , protein acetylation , phosphorylation , and induction of proteins were observed in the IC many hours following novel taste consumption , and it is possible that these correlative molecular changes ( proteins synthesis and epigenetic regulation ) may contribute to the long-trace CTA ( Swank and Sweatt , 2001; Yefet et al . , 2006; Elkobi et al . , 2008; for reviews see Gal-Ben-Ari and Rosenblum , 2012 ) . Conceptually , on the one hand , our short-trace CTA complies with the commonly held assumption of neuroscience theories of associative learning that convergence of CS and US information onto particular cells/circuits leads to changes in synaptic strength at the synapses mediating the CS input to those commonly activated cells/circuit and that it underlies association formation , i . e . Hebbian plasticity ( NMDAR-CaMKII-AMPARs in the IC probably in co-ordination with the amygdala; Yasoshima et al . , 2000; Ferreira et al . , 2005; Hashikawa et al . , 2013 ) . On the other hand , the long-trace CTA challenges this assumption , and it is possible that because of the multi-channeled background information with an increasing time interval as discussed above , homeostatic plasticity may play a crucial role to encode multiple memory traces via coordinating several brain structures such as the IC , amygdala , hippocampus , prefrontal cortices in the long-trace CTA ( Vitureira et al . , 2012; Turrigiano , 2012; Pozo and Goda , 2010 ) . Overall , our data suggest that the neural mechanisms of associative learning can be an assimilation of multiple memory traces when the two relevant experiences are separated in time . \n The experimental subjects were rats ( Rattus Norvegicus; Wistar Hola and Sprague Dawley ) , obtained from Harlan ( Rehovot , Israel ) . They were maintained at the University of Haifa in a temperature controlled ( 22\u201324\u00b0C ) animal core facility under a 12\u2009hr light/12\u2009hr dark cycle ( light phase 7:00\u201319:00 ) . Experiments were conducted at least 7 days after the acclimatization to the facility when the body weight of the rats was 220-\u2013350\u00a0g . Rats were group housed ( 4\u20136 rats ) in home cages with food and water ad libitum , and were individually housed before the start of the experiments . All the experiments were conducted during the light phase . All grouped data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM . Comparisons between data of two independent groups were analyzed by unpaired Student's t test and the differences between the variances of groups were corrected following Levene\u2019s test for equality of variances . Multiple group comparisons were assessed using one way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and repeated-measures ANOVA . Follow-up analyses were conducted using Fisher\u2019s least significant difference , Bonferoni , and independent sample t-tests , when significant main effects or interactions were detected . Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test , Friedman's test , and Mann Whitney U test were conducted when the data were non-normally distributed . Pearson\u2019s correlation was conducted to analyze the association between GluA1 and pT286CaMKII\u03b1 . All of the comparisons were conducted using two-tailed tests of significance . The null hypothesis was rejected at the p\u00a0<0 . 05 level . Data analysis was performed using SPSS-version 19 ."}

For example , a group of viruses called virophages protect microscopic sea creatures called plankton from deadly infections by so-called giant viruses . In fact , virophages need plankton infected with giant viruses to survive because they use enzymes from the giant viruses to turn on their own genes . A virophage called mavirus integrates its genes into the DNA of a type of plankton called Cafeteria . It lays dormant in the DNA until a giant virus called CroV infects the plankton . This suggests that the mavirus may be a built-in defense against CroV infections and laboratory studies seem to confirm this . But whether wild Cafeteria also use these defenses is unknown . Hackl et al . show that virophages are common in the DNA of wild Cafeteria and that the two appear to have a mutually beneficial relationship . In the experiments , the researchers sequenced the genomes of four Cafeteria populations from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and looked for virophages in their DNA . Each of the four Cafeteria genomes contained dozens of virophages , which suggests that virophages are important to these plankton . This included several relatives of the mavirus and seven new virophages . Virophage genes were often interrupted by so called jumping genes , which may take advantage of the virophages the way the virophages use giant viruses to meet their own needs . The experiments show that virophages often co-exist with marine plankton from around the world and these relationships are likely beneficial . In fact , the experiments suggest that the virophages may have played an important role in the evolution of these plankton . Further studies may help scientists learn more about virus ecology and how viruses have shaped the evolution of other creatures .", "source": "Virophages can parasitize giant DNA viruses and may provide adaptive anti-giant virus defense in unicellular eukaryotes . Under laboratory conditions , the virophage mavirus integrates into the nuclear genome of the marine flagellate Cafeteria burkhardae and reactivates upon superinfection with the giant virus CroV . In natural systems , however , the prevalence and diversity of host-virophage associations has not been systematically explored . Here , we report dozens of integrated virophages in four globally sampled C . burkhardae strains that constitute up to 2% of their host genomes . These endogenous mavirus-like elements ( EMALEs ) separated into eight types based on GC-content , nucleotide similarity , and coding potential and carried diverse promoter motifs implicating interactions with different giant viruses . Between host strains , some EMALE insertion loci were conserved indicating ancient integration events , whereas the majority of insertion sites were unique to a given host strain suggesting that EMALEs are active and mobile . Furthermore , we uncovered a unique association between EMALEs and a group of tyrosine recombinase retrotransposons , revealing yet another layer of parasitism in this nested microbial system . Our findings show that virophages are widespread and dynamic in wild Cafeteria populations , supporting their potential role in antiviral defense in protists . \n Many eukaryotic genomes harbor endogenous viral elements ( EVEs ) ( Feschotte and Gilbert , 2012 ) . For retroviruses , integration as a provirus is an essential part of their replication cycles , but other viruses also occasionally endogenize , for instance with the help of cellular retroelements ( Holmes , 2011 ) . Some green algal genomes even contain giant EVEs of several hundred kilobase pairs ( kbp ) in length ( Moniruzzaman et al . , 2020 ) , but unlike prophages in bacteria and archaea , most eukaryotic EVEs are thought to be \u2018genomic fossils\u2019 and incapable of virion formation and horizontal transmission . However , some viral genes may be co-opted for various host functions ( Frank and Feschotte , 2017; Aswad and Katzourakis , 2012 ) . In recent years , the exploration of protist-infecting giant viruses has uncovered a novel class of associated smaller DNA viruses with diverse and unprecedented genome integration capabilities . Viruses of the family Lavidaviridae , commonly known as virophages , depend for their replication on giant DNA viruses of the family Mimiviridae and can parasitize them during coinfection of a suitable protist host ( La Scola et al . , 2008; Krupovic et al . , 2016a; Duponchel and Fischer , 2019 ) . A striking example is the virophage mavirus , which strongly inhibits virion synthesis of the lytic giant virus CroV during coinfection of the marine heterotrophic nanoflagellate Cafeteria sp . ( Stramenopiles; Bicosoecida ) ( Fischer and Suttle , 2011; Fischer and Hackl , 2016 ) . Virophages possess 15\u201330 kbp long double-stranded ( ds ) DNA genomes of circular or linear topology that tend to have low GC-contents ( 27\u201351% ) ( Fischer , 2020 ) . A typical virophage genome encodes 20\u201330 proteins , including a major capsid protein ( MCP ) , a minor capsid or penton protein ( PEN ) , a DNA packaging ATPase , and a maturation cysteine protease ( PRO ) ( Krupovic et al . , 2016a ) . In addition to this conserved morphogenesis module , virophages encode DNA replication and integration proteins that were likely acquired independently in different virophage lineages ( Yutin et al . , 2013 ) . Viruses in the genus Mavirus contain a rve-family integrase ( rve-INT ) that is also found in retrotransposons and retroviruses , with close homologs among the eukaryotic Maverick/Polinton elements ( MPEs ) ( Fischer and Suttle , 2011 ) . MPEs were initially described as DNA transposons ( Pritham et al . , 2007; Kapitonov and Jurka , 2006 ) , but many of them carry the morphogenesis gene module and thus qualify as endogenous viruses ( Krupovic et al . , 2014 ) . Phylogenetic analysis suggests that mavirus-type virophages share a common ancestry with MPEs and the related Polinton-like viruses ( PLVs ) ( Fischer and Suttle , 2011; Yutin et al . , 2013 ) . We therefore tested the integration capacity of mavirus using the cultured protist Cafeteria burkhardae ( formerly Cafeteria roenbergensis; Fenchel and Patterson , 1988; Schoenle et al . , 2020 ) and found that mavirus integrates efficiently into the nuclear host genome ( Fischer and Hackl , 2016 ) . The resulting mavirus provirophages are transcriptionally silent unless the host cell is infected with CroV , which leads to reactivation and virion formation of mavirus . Newly produced virophage particles then inhibit CroV replication and increase host population survival during subsequent rounds of coinfection ( Fischer and Hackl , 2016 ) . The mutualistic Cafeteria-mavirus symbiosis may thus act as an adaptive defense system against lytic giant viruses ( Fischer and Hackl , 2016; Koonin and Krupovic , 2016 ) . The integrated state of mavirus is pivotal to the proposed defense scheme as it represents the host\u2019s indirect antigenic memory of CroV ( Koonin and Krupovic , 2017 ) . We therefore investigated endogenous virophages to assess the prevalence and potential significance of virophage-mediated defense systems in natural protist populations . Here , we report that mavirus-like EVEs are common , diverse , and most likely active mobile genetic elements ( MGEs ) of C . burkhardae . Our results suggest an influential role of these viruses on the ecology and evolution of their bicosoecid hosts . \n In preparation of screening for endogenous virophages , we generated high-quality de novo genome assemblies of four cultured C . burkhardae strains ( Hackl et al . , 2020 ) . These strains , designated BVI , Cflag , E4-10P ( E4-10 ) , and RCC970-E3 ( RCC970 ) , were isolated from the Caribbean Sea in 2012 , the Northwest Atlantic in 1986 , the Northeast Pacific in 1989 , and the Southeast Pacific in 2004 , respectively . We sequenced their genomes using both short-read ( Illumina MiSeq ) and long-read ( Pacific Biosciences RSII ) technologies in order to produce assemblies that would resolve 20\u201330 kb long repetitive elements within the host genomic context . Each C . burkhardae genome assembly comprised of 34\u201336 megabase pairs with an average GC-content of 70% ( Hackl et al . , 2020 ) . To identify endogenous virophages , we combined sequence similarity searches against known virophage genomes with genomic screening for GC-content anomalies . The two approaches yielded redundant results and virophage elements were clearly discernible from eukaryotic genome regions based on their low ( 30\u201350% ) GC-content ( Figure 1A ) . Each element had at least one open reading frame ( ORF ) with a top blastp hit to a mavirus protein , with no elements bearing close resemblance to Sputnik or other virophages outside the genus Mavirus . In the four Cafeteria genomes combined , we found 138 endogenous mavirus-like elements ( EMALEs , Figure 1B and C; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 , Supplementary file 1 ) . Thirty-three of these elements were flanked by terminal inverted repeats ( TIRs ) and host DNA and can thus be considered full-length viral genomes . The remainder were partial virophage genomes that were located at contig ends or on short contigs . These cases arise from incomplete assembly rather than from biological truncations , since the assembly algorithm probably terminated due to the presence of multiple identical or highly similar EMALEs within the same host genome \u2013 a well-known issue for repetitive sequences ( Kolmogorov et al . , 2019 ) . With 55 elements , C . burkhardae strain BVI contained nearly twice as many EMALEs as any of the other strains , where we found 27\u201329 elements per genome ( Figure 1C , Supplementary file 1 ) . Compared to the total assembly length , EMALEs composed an estimated 0 . 7\u20131 . 8% of each host assembly ( Figure 1D ) . Contributions calculated from assemblies deviated only slightly ( 0 . 01\u20130 . 3% ) from read-based calculations . Therefore , the assemblies seem to provide a good representation of the actual contribution of EMALEs to the overall host genomes . From here on , we focus our analysis on the 33 complete EMALE genomes , which were 5 . 5\u201321 . 5 kb long with a median length of 19 . 8 kb , and TIRs that varied in length from 0 . 2 to 2 . 3 kb with a median of 0 . 9 kb ( Supplementary file 1 , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Their GC-contents ranged from 29 . 7% to 52 . 7% , excluding retrotransposon insertions where present . To classify EMALEs we used an all-versus-all DNA dot plot approach ( Figure 2 ) . It revealed two main blocks: The first block contained EMALEs with GC-contents of 29 . 7\u201338 . 5% ( median 35 . 3% ) , whereas EMALEs in the second block had GC-contents ranging from 47 . 2% to 52 . 7% ( median 49 . 3% ) . The C . burkhardae EMALEs can thus be roughly separated into low-GC and mid-GC groups . Based on the similarity patterns within each block , we further distinguish eight EMALE types , with low-GC EMALEs comprising types 1\u20134 and mid-GC EMALEs comprising types 5\u20138 ( Figure 2 ) . Representative genome diagrams for each EMALE type are shown in Figure 3 , for a schematic of all 33 complete EMALEs , see Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 . According to this classification scheme , the reference mavirus strain Spezl falls within type 4 of the low-GC EMALEs ( Figures 2 and 3 , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Partial EMALEs were classified based on their sequence similarity to full-length type species ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The codon and amino acid composition of EMALE genes clearly correlated with the overall GC-content of the EMALE genomes ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . For each encoded amino acid , we observed a strong shift toward synonymous codons reflecting the overall GC trend , and across amino acids , we observed a shift from those encoded by high-GC codons to those encoded by low-GC codons in low-GC EMALEs and vice versa . This uniform trend across all amino acids likely indicates that selection and evolutionary processes driving GC-content variation in these viruses act on the nucleotide level , rather than on the encoded proteins . With few exceptions , EMALEs are predicted to encode 17\u201321 proteins each . None of the encoding genes was found to contain introns . The virion morphogenesis module in EMALE types 1 and 3\u20137 consists of the canonical virophage core genes corresponding to MCP , PEN , ATPase , and PRO proteins . Type 2 EMALEs likely encode a different set of capsid genes as discussed below , and the truncated EMALE type 8 lacks recognizable morphogenesis genes . Another highly conserved gene in EMALE types 1 and 3\u20137 is MV14 , which is always found immediately upstream of the ATPase ( Figure 3 , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) and codes for a protein of unknown function that is part of the mavirus virion ( Born et al . , 2018 ) . MV14 is present in various metagenomic virophage sequences ( Paez-Espino et al . , 2019 ) and , based on synteny and protein localization , likely encodes an important virion component in members of the genus Mavirus . The replication/integration module consists of the rve-INT gene and at least one additional ORF coding for a primase/helicase and a DNA polymerase . Low-GC EMALEs encode a mavirus-related primase/helicase and protein-primed family B DNA polymerase ( pPolB ) ( Figure 3 , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Mid-GC EMALEs , on the other hand , lack the pPolB gene and feature a longer primase/helicase ORF that may include a DNA polymerase domain similar to the helicase-polymerase fusion genes described in PLVs ( Krupovic et al . , 2016b ) . Other mavirus genes frequently found in EMALEs include MV19 ( encoding a putative protease domain ) , and two genes of unknown function , MV08 and MV12 . Interestingly , all mid-GC EMALEs encode a predicted tyrosine recombinase ( YR ) in addition to the rve-INT and thus possess two predicted enzymes for genome integration . YRs have been found in other virophages and likely catalyze integration into giant virus genomes ( Desnues et al . , 2012; Yutin et al . , 2015 ) . Notable genes unique to one EMALE type include a putative DNA methylase and a ribonucleotide reductase small subunit gene found in EMALE07 . The Tlr6F protein encoded by EMALE types 1 + 2 is present in diverse MGEs , including other virophages , PLVs , and large DNA viruses of the phylum Nucleocytoviricota ( Koonin and Krupovic , 2017; Stough et al . , 2019 ) . In general , genes were syntenic between EMALEs of the same type , whereas gene order was poorly conserved among EMALEs of different types , with the following exceptions: MCP was always preceded by PEN , and ATPase was always preceded by MV14 , whereas the MV14-ATPase-PRO-PEN-MCP morphogenesis gene order as seen in mavirus was present only in EMALE types 4\u20137 . EMALE02 represents an interesting case , as it shares 6\u20137 kb of its 5\u2019 part ( we chose the primase/helicase genes to mark the 5\u2019 end of all EMALEs ) with EMALE01 , while the remaining 11 kb are not closely related to other EMALEs or virophages ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Genes encoded in the latter region are mostly ORFans , with the exception of an MV12-like gene and divergent MCP and ATPase genes with remote similarity to PLVs ( Bellas and Sommaruga , 2021 ) and adintoviruses ( Starrett et al . , 2021 ) . EMALE02 may thus be the result of a recombination event that exchanged the canonical virophage morphogenesis module of EMALE01 with capsid genes of a PLV ( Figure 3 , dashed line ) . Overall , these observations support the notion that recombination and non-homologous gene replacement are important factors in virophage genome evolution ( Yutin et al . , 2013 ) . To validate our classification scheme for EMALEs and to place them in a phylogenetic context to other virophages , we used maximum likelihood reconstruction on the core proteins MCP , PEN , ATPase , and PRO , as well as on rve-INT ( Figure 4 ) . In the resulting phylogenetic trees , EMALE core proteins formed monophyletic clades with mavirus and related sequences from environmental samples , thus significantly expanding the known diversity of the genus Mavirus . The environmental sequences that clustered with EMALE core proteins include a single amplified genome ( SAG ) from an uncultured chrysophyte ( Castillo et al . , 2019 ) , the metagenomic Ace Lake Mavirus ( ALM ) ( Zhou et al . , 2013 ) , and four additional metagenomes that were identified in a global survey of virophage sequences ( Paez-Espino et al . , 2019 ) . The chrysophyte SAG is nearly identical to mavirus strain Spezl and indicates that the host range of mavirus extends beyond bicosoecids . The metagenomic sequences either clustered with one of the EMALE types , or branched separately from them , which suggests the existence of additional sub-groups ( e . g . M590M2_1006461 ) . Within the Mavirus clade , EMALEs of a given type were monophyletic for each of the four core proteins , which corroborates their dot plot-based classification . It is worth noting that although EMALEs of types 5 and 6 are largely syntenic ( Figure 3 , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , they were clearly distinguishable in their phylogenetic signatures ( Figure 4 ) . A comparison of clade topologies revealed that even within the conserved morphogenesis module , individual proteins differed with regard to their neighboring clades , and low-GC and mid-GC EMALEs did not cluster separately from each other . These observations could suggest that the morphogenesis modules of different EMALE types diversified simultaneously and that adaptation of GC-content may occur rather quickly . In contrast , phylogenetic analysis of rve-INT proteins revealed separate clades for low-GC and mid-GC EMALEs ( Figure 4 ) . Each of these clades was affiliated with different cellular homologs that included MPEs and retroelements . Notably , the rve-INT genes of low-GC EMALEs were located near the 5\u2019 end of the genomes , whereas in mid-GC EMALEs , they were located near the 3\u2019 end ( Figure 3 , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . These observations suggest that EMALEs encode two different rve-INT versions , one specific for low-GC EMALEs that co-occurs with the pPolB and a shorter primase/helicase ORF , and one specific for mid-GC EMALEs that co-occurs with a longer primase/helicase ORF . The two integrase versions may have been acquired independently , or one version could have replaced the other during EMALE evolution . Such non-homologous gene replacement appears to have taken place among the primase/helicase genes , too , as previously noted for virophages in general ( Yutin et al . , 2013 ) . EMALEs encode several different versions of primase/helicase genes with a degree of amino acid divergence that precluded their inclusion in a single multiple sequence alignment . The YR proteins encoded by EMALE types 5\u20138 formed a monophyletic clade and were part of a larger group of recombinases that included virophages from freshwater metagenomes , as well as microalgae and algal nucleocytoviruses ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The four C . burkhardae strains displayed distinct EMALE signatures: strain BVI had the highest number of virophage elements with 13 complete and 42 partial EMALEs , whereas the other three strains had 6\u20137 complete and 20\u201322 partial EMALEs each ( Figure 1C , Supplementary file 1 ) . EMALE types 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 were present in every host strain , EMALE07 was found in all strains except Cflag , and EMALE types 2 and 8 were detected in strains BVI and E4-10 only . We found no evidence for sequence-specific genome integration of EMALEs after inspecting the host DNA sequences that flanked EMALE integration sites , which confirms previous reports of mavirus integration ( Fischer and Hackl , 2016 ) . EMALEs were flanked by target site duplications ( TSDs ) that were predominantly 3\u20135 bp in length , although some were as short as 1 bp or as long as 9 bp ( Supplementary file 1 ) . By comparison , mavirus and MPEs generate 5\u20136 bp long TSDs upon integration ( Fischer and Hackl , 2016; Pritham et al . , 2007; Kapitonov and Jurka , 2006 ) . To assess whether homologous EMALEs were found in identical loci in closely related host genomes , we conducted sequence similarity searches with the flanking regions of each of the 33 fully resolved EMALEs . Whenever these searches returned a homologous full or partial EMALE with at least one matching host flank , we considered the EMALE locus to be conserved in these host strains . We found varying degrees of conservation , with examples shown in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 . In 11 cases , an EMALE insertion was conserved in at least two host strains ( Supplementary file 1 ) : three EMALE loci were shared by all four strains , four were shared by three strains , and another four were shared by two strains . Based on conserved EMALE loci , strains Cflag and RCC970 were most closely related with nine shared EMALE integrations , which is in line with phylogenetic and average nucleotide identity ( ANI ) analyses of these strains ( Hackl et al . , 2020 ) . The four C . burkhardae genomes have ANIs of >99% and thus appear to differ mostly based on their content of EMALEs and other MGEs . The most parsimonious scenario for the origin of EMALEs that are located in identical loci in different host strains is that they derived from a single integration event . For instance , EMALE03 BVI_101 is orthologous to Cflag_017C and RCC970_016A ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C ) , which suggests that this element initially colonized the common ancestor of C . burkhardae strains BVI , Cflag , and RCC970 . Further cases of redundant EMALEs are Cflag_017B & RCC970_016B ( EMALE01 ) and BVI_029 & RCC970_095 ( EMALE06 ) . These elements may thus derive from relatively ancient integration events , whereas 18 of the 33 complete EMALEs represent integrations that were unique to a single host strain ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Strain BVI contained 10 of these 18 unique integrations , more than twice as many as any other strain . The genomic landscape around EMALE integration sites ranged from repeat-free flanking regions to complex host repeats ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . Of the 29 different integration sites represented by the 33 fully resolved EMALEs , 18 were located near repetitive host DNA ( within 10 kb from the insertion site ) . These repeats , in addition to EMALE TIRs , multiple copies of the same EMALE type , and the putative heterozygosity of EMALE insertions , occasionally caused assembly problems , as illustrated in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 . Next , we analyzed whether EMALE insertions interrupted coding sequences of the host . Fifteen integration sites were located within a predicted host gene ( 13 in exons , 2 in introns ) , four were found in predicted 3\u2019 untranslated regions , and three were located in intergenic regions ( Supplementary file 1 ) . These data show that EMALE insertions may disrupt eukaryotic genes with potential negative consequences for the host . The apparent preference for integration in coding regions could be assembly related , driven by increased accessibility of euchromatin , or linked to host factors that could direct the rve-INT via its CHROMO domain ( Gao et al . , 2008 ) . Based on genomic features such as coding potential , ORF integrity , and host distribution , most EMALEs appear to be active MGEs . With the exception of EMALE08 and EMALE02 , all endogenous Cafeteria virophages encode the canonical morphogenesis gene module consisting of MCP , PEN , ATPase , PRO , as well as MV14 . EMALE02 likely encodes more distantly related capsid genes . Therefore , all EMALE types except EMALE08 should be autonomous for virion formation . In addition , all EMALEs contain at least one predicted enzyme for genome integration , an rve-INT in EMALE types 1\u20137 and a YR in EMALE types 5\u20138 . EMALEs thus encode the enzymatic repertoire for colonizing new host genomes . Finally , the high variability of EMALE integration loci among otherwise closely related host strains strongly argues for ongoing colonization of natural Cafeteria populations by virophages . The genomic similarity to mavirus implies that EMALEs may also depend on a giant virus for activation and horizontal transmission . Shared regulatory sequences in virophages and their respective giant viruses suggest that the molecular basis of virophage activation lies in the recognition of virophage gene promoters by giant virus encoded transcription factors ( Fischer and Suttle , 2011; Claverie and Abergel , 2009; Legendre et al . , 2010 ) . We therefore analyzed the 100 nt upstream regions of EMALE ORFs for conserved sequence motifs using MEME ( Bailey et al . , 2009 ) . For all type 4 EMALEs , which include mavirus , we recovered the previously described mavirus promotor motif \u2018TCTA\u2019 , flanked by AT-rich regions . This motif corresponds to the conserved late gene promoter in CroV ( Fischer and Suttle , 2011; Fischer et al . , 2010 ) , thus possibly indicating that all type 4 EMALEs could be reactivated by CroV or close relatives . EMALEs of other types lacked the \u2018TCTA\u2019 motif , but contained putative promoter sequences that may be compatible with different giant viruses ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5 ) . MGEs are prone to various decay processes including pseudogenization , recombination , and truncation . Among the 33 fully resolved EMALEs are three truncated elements: Cflag_215 and RCC970_122 ( both EMALE04 ) , and BVI_005 ( EMALE08 ) ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Interestingly , even these shorter elements are flanked by TIRs , which must have regenerated after the truncation event . Whereas most EMALE ORFs appeared to be intact , as judged by comparison with homologous genes on syntenic elements , several EMALEs contained fragmented ORFs ( e . g . ATPase and PEN genes in EMALE04 BVI_055B , Figure 3 ) . To test whether premature stop codons may be the result of assembly artifacts , we amplified selected EMALEs by PCR and analyzed the products using Sanger sequencing . When we compared the Sanger assemblies with the Illumina/PacBio assemblies , we noticed that the latter contained several substitutions and indels . For example , the MCP gene of EMALE01 RCC970_016B was split into three ORFs in the Illumina/PacBio assembly , whereas a single ORF was present in the corresponding Sanger assembly ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6 ) . None of the Sanger assemblies confirmed fragmentation of conserved virophage genes , emphasizing the importance of independent sequence validation . However , since it was not possible to re-sequence all potential pseudogene locations , we cannot exclude that some EMALE genes may be fragmented . Overall , EMALE ORFs appeared to be intact and are thus likely to encode functional proteins . Strikingly , about one in four virophage elements was interrupted by a GC-rich sequence with a typical length of ~6 kb ( Figure 5A , Supplementary file 1 ) . We identified these insertions as retrotransposons of the Ngaro superfamily , within the DIRS order of retrotransposons ( Wicker et al . , 2007 ) . Ngaro retrotransposons feature split direct repeats with A1\u2013[ORFs]\u2013B1A2B2 structure ( Figure 5D ) , encode a YR instead of the rve-INT that is typical for retrotransposons , and are found in various eukaryotes from protists to vertebrates ( Poulter and Goodwin , 2005 ) . In the four C . burkhardae strains , we annotated 80 Ngaro elements , with 10\u201325 copies per strain ( Supplementary file 1 ) . In addition , we found isolated AB repeats scattered throughout the genome , which could have arisen from recombination of 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 repeats and are reminiscent of solo long terminal repeats of endogenous retroviruses ( Friedli and Trono , 2015 ) . Solo AB repeats were also occasionally present in EMALEs ( BVI_016 , BVI_115 , Cflag_024 , Cflag_214 , Cflag_215 ) . Dot plot analysis of concatenated Cafeteria Ngaro sequences revealed four distinct types that showed no similarity at the nucleotide level , but appeared to share the same coding potential ( Figure 5B and D ) . Based on synteny to previously described Ngaros , ORF1 may encode a Gag-like protein; ORF2 encodes predicted reverse transcriptase ( Pfam PF00078 ) and ribonuclease H domains ( Pfam PF17919 ) ; and ORF3 encodes a predicted YR ( Pfam PF00589 ) with the conserved His-X-X-Arg motif and catalytic Tyr residue . Ngaro YRs are related to putative transposons of bacteria and eukaryotes ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , but bear no sequence similarity to the EMALE-encoded YRs . Interestingly , the four Ngaro types in C . burkhardae differed with regard to their integration site preference . Whereas 91% of type 1 Ngaros were inserted in an EMALE , this was the case for only 14% and 8% of type 3 and type 4 Ngaros , respectively . At first glance , type 2 Ngaros were distributed evenly among viral and eukaryotic DNA ( 47% inside EMALEs , 53% outside EMALEs ) . However , several type 2 Ngaros were truncated at their 5\u2019 end , featuring ~2 kb long deletions that covered ORF1 . All of these deletion variants , which we designate as type 2b , were located in host DNA , in contrast to 82% of the full-length type 2a Ngaros that were inserted in EMALEs ( Figure 5C and D ) . Similarly , most of the type 1 Ngaros that were inserted into eukaryotic chromatin also lacked ORF1 . Hence , it appears that ORF1 determines the integration site specificity of Ngaro retrotransposons . We did not observe any preference of host-genome-integrated Ngaros for regions with a GC-content lower than the host average . Out of 20 Ngaro insertion sites with analyzable EMALE flanking regions ( including partial EMALEs ) , 9 were located in intergenic regions , 7 in EMALE genes ( 1\u00d7 primase/helicase , 1\u00d7 pPolB , 1\u00d7 MV12 , 4\u00d7 MV19 ) , and 4 in TIRs ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Considering that intergenic regions comprise only 5\u201310% of an EMALE genome , we notice a significant bias ( p < 1e\u20135 , Fisher\u2019s exact test ) toward Ngaro integration in intergenic EMALE DNA , which may be caused either by purifying selection of deleterious Ngaro insertions or by a higher preference for Ngaro integration into EMALE intergenic regions , e . g . due to their lower GC-content . A possible consequence of retrotransposon insertion is the loss of biological activity and subsequent pseudogenization . However , we found that Ngaro-containing EMALEs did not contain more fragmented genes than Ngaro-free EMALEs ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Whereas the biological properties of Ngaro retrotransposons and their influence on host-virus-virophage dynamics remain to be explored , the EMALE-Ngaro interactions appear to be convoluted . For instance , an EMALE03 genome in strain Cflag is interrupted by two adjacent Ngaro1 insertions , while the EMALE itself is located inside an Ngaro4 element ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . \n Virophages represent a recently discovered family of eukaryotic dsDNA viruses that possess interesting genome integration properties and have potentially far-reaching eco-evolutionary consequences . Our genomic survey of the marine bicosoecid C . burkhardae revealed an unexpected abundance and diversity of endogenous virophages , with dozens of elements in a single host genome . Based on DNA dot plots and phylogenetic analysis , we distinguish eight different types of mavirus-related endogenous virophages . Similar to mavirus , these EMALEs could potentially reactivate and replicate in the presence of a compatible giant virus . Mavirus is proposed to act as an adaptive defense system against CroV in Cafeteria populations ( Fischer and Hackl , 2016; Koonin and Krupovic , 2016 ) , and our findings suggest that different types of EMALEs may respond to different giant viruses infecting Cafeteria . The assortment of endogenous virophages in a given host genome may thus reflect the giant virus infection history of that population ( Blanc et al . , 2015 ) . Some EMALEs are present in orthologous genomic loci in two or more host strains and likely date back to the common ancestor of these strains . However , at least half of the EMALE insertions are specific to a given host strain and may thus have been acquired relatively recently . Combined with the overall integrity of EMALEs and the conservation of integrase and capsid genes , these findings suggest that endogenous virophages in C . burkhardae are active MGEs . Similar to other MGEs , EMALEs are likely prone to various decay processes including pseudogenization , truncation , and recombination; however , the extent to which these mechanisms affect EMALE stability is currently unclear . Although nonsense mutations appear to be present in some EMALE genes , re-sequencing of selected genomic regions did not confirm pseudogene loci in those cases ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6 ) . We found three truncated EMALEs ( 5\u201315 kb long ) , but these are not to be confused with the 105 partial EMALEs that resulted from computational limitations during sequence assembly of these multi-copy elements . Recombination most likely created the EMALE02 variant , with no obvious signs of degradation . Based on our EMALE identification approach ( see Materials and methods ) , we are quite confident that we have not missed more severely degraded EMALEs or more divergent virophages , except perhaps for hypothetical elements lacking any recognizable sequence similarity to annotated virophages and possessing a GC-content similar to that of the host genome . Overall , these observations raise the question of how balance between new virophage integrations and loss of existing EMALEs is achieved to prevent overload of the host genome with mobile DNA . Possible explanations include loss by homologous recombination , for example , between TIRs of the same or similar EMALEs , excision of EMALEs via host- or EMALE-encoded integrases or endonucleases , or mechanisms to limit the uptake of new elements . Given that multiple mavirus genome integrations per host cell can be observed within a period of days ( Fischer and Hackl , 2016 ) and that virophage integration rates under natural infection conditions are likely to fall within similar timescales , we hypothesize that the majority of EMALE loss may occur before pseudogenization and degradation can take place . EMALEs would thus have relatively short residence times in the unicellular Cafeteria compared to germline EVEs of multicellular eukaryotes ( Barreat and Katzourakis , 2021 ) . Horizontal transmission of virophages in natural environments is likely limited by their requirement for two concurrent biological entities , namely a susceptible host cell infected with a permissive giant virus . Similar to temperate bacteriophages , persistence in the proviral state may thus be an essential survival strategy for virophages , as underscored by the abundance of EMALEs in C . burkhardae . Endogenous virophages may also be common in eukaryotes outside the order Bicosoecales , although a search in 2015 for provirophages in 1153 eukaryotic genomes found only one clear case in the chlorarachniophyte alga Bigelowiella natans ( Blanc et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast to rapidly increasing virophage reports from metagenomic sequence mining in recent years ( Paez-Espino et al . , 2019 ) , we propose that the discovery of host-integrated virophages is still hampered not only by sampling bias , but also by technical limitations . For instance , AT-rich mavirus DNA was severely underrepresented when we sequenced the genome of C . burkhardae strain E4-10M1 with the standard Illumina MiSeq protocol ( Fischer and Hackl , 2016 ) . Additional problems arise during binning and assembly procedures . Although our sequencing and assembly strategy was specifically tailored to endogenous virophages and resolved 33 EMALEs in their host genomic context , dozens of EMALEs were only partially assembled , some may contain assembly errors ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 ) , and others may have been missed altogether . Advances in long-read sequencing technologies and assembly algorithms will likely alleviate such problems . Surprisingly , we found that EMALEs were frequently interrupted by Ngaro retrotransposons , which revealed an additional level of nested parasitism in this microbial system . Cafeteria genomes contain four distinct Ngaro types with different affinities for EMALEs . Deletion of ORF1 in type 1 and type 2 Ngaros coincides with a decreased occurrence of these retrotransposons in EMALEs ( Figure 5 ) . Syntenic ORFs in other Ngaros are predicted to encode a Gag-like structural protein ( Poulter and Butler , 2015 ) , and Gag proteins of several retroviruses have been linked to integration site specificity ( Lewinski et al . , 2006; Tobaly-Tapiero et al . , 2008 ) . The putative Gag proteins of Cafeteria Ngaros may thus influence whether retrotransposon insertion occurs in an EMALE or in eukaryotic chromatin . So far , retrotransposons have not been described for giant DNA viruses or virophages; however , pandoravirus genomes contain DNA transposons ( Sun et al . , 2015 ) , and a class of 7 kb long DNA MGEs called transpovirons interacts with the particles and genomes of Acanthamoeba-infecting mimiviruses and their virophages , apparently without affecting viral replication ( Desnues et al . , 2012; Jeudy et al . , 2020 ) . It remains to be studied whether Ngaro retrotransposons use reactivated virophages or giant viruses as vehicles for horizontal transmission , and what effect retrotransposon insertion in EMALEs has on the fitness of the virophage , the host cell , and their associated giant viruses . In conclusion , we show that endogenous virophage genomes are abundant and diverse in the marine heterotrophic protist C . burkhardae . These mavirus-like EVEs appear to be active and dynamic MGEs with significant potential to shape the genome evolution of their hosts . We present evidence for recombination and gene exchange within EMALEs , and a previously unknown affiliation between virophages and YR retrotransposons . Our findings imply an important role for EMALEs in the ecology and evolution of bicosoecids and are in line with the hypothesis that endogenous virophages provide adaptive defense against giant viruses . \n C . burkhardae strains BVI , Cflag , E4-10P , and RCC970-E3 were cultured , and their genomes sequenced and assembled as described previously ( Hackl et al . , 2020 ) . To identify endogenous virophages , we initially took a manual approach and searched for clearly visible drops in GC-content along contigs when visualized in Artemis Release 16 . 0 . 0 ( Rutherford et al . , 2000 ) . Based on our experience we suspected that integrated virophages would have a considerably lower GC-content than the host genomes . For those low-GC regions we then computed DNA dot plots with Gepard ( Krumsiek et al . , 2007 ) to detect TIRs , predicted ORFs with Artemis , manually curated them into gene calls , and also manually assigned functional annotations based on blastp searches against known virophages and public databases . This resulted in the identification of 33 manually curated , TIR-containing high-confidence ( \u2018complete\u2019 ) EMALEs . Partial EMALEs that could not be fully assembled and were thus located on contig termini were identified based on sequence similarity to annotated virophages and EMALEs using the BLAST suite . Their boundaries were determined based on GC-content or sequence similarity to already annotated TIRs . Partial EMALEs were annotated with prodigal-2 . 6 . 3 ( Hyatt et al . , 2010 ) . We pre-trained one gene model for mid-GC and one for high-GC EMALEs , and called genes on those genomes separately . Where present , we masked integrated Ngaro elements with \u2018N\u2019s prior to training and annotation because we observed in trial runs that automated gene prediction could not properly resolve the gene structure of the Ngaros and would produce fragmented and spurious gene calls for these regions . We also explored other gene prediction programs including PHANOTATE ( McNair et al . , 2019 ) and VGAS ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) , but found pre-trained prodigal to produce results most consistent with manually curated expert annotations for EMALE genomes . Retrotransposon insertions were first noticed in GC-content graphs as 6\u20137 kb long GC-rich sequences that interrupted AT-rich EMALEs . DNA dot plot analysis of these regions showed split direct repeats , and conserved domain and tblastx searches predicted RNaseH , reverse transcriptase , and tyrosine recombinase domains . ORFs were annotated in Artemis based on the predicted conserved domains . These initially curated protein sequences and direct repeats were then used to seed blast searches against all four C . burkhardae genomes to identify additional Ngaro elements , which were inspected individually and annotated manually . To quantify how much of each host genome is comprised of EMALEs and Ngaros , we applied two complementary strategies: ( i ) We compared the number of nucleotides annotated as EMALEs and Ngaros in the assemblies to the overall assembly sizes , and ( ii ) we quantified the number of nucleotides in the PacBio reads that we could assign to either of the three fractions \u2013 host , EMALE , and Ngaro . The latter approach is less prone to assembly biases , such as overestimation of contributions for elements only present in one allele , or underestimation of contribution due to collapsed repeated copies , or elements not assembled because of low coverage . We aligned the PacBio reads to the assemblies using minimap2 v2 . 16 ( -x map-pb ) ( Li , 2018 ) and computed the coverage of the different genomic regions with samtools v1 . 9 ( Li et al . , 2009 ) . We did not consider Illumina data for the quantification due to an observed sequencing bias against low-GC regions that would lead to lower EMALE estimates . To analyze possible correlations between EMALE GC-content and the codon composition of their genes , we counted codons of all genes of complete EMALEs with a custom Perl script and visualized their distribution relative to their GC-content with a custom R script ."}

When genes are active , copies of the DNA are made using molecules of ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) and these can then be used as templates to make proteins . One way genes can be controlled is by adding small chemical tags that mark them out to be activated or deactivated , known as epigenetic control . The muscle disease facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy ( FSHD ) is caused by the loss of the chemical tags that normally keep certain genes switched off in many cell types . One of these genes is DUX4 , which in healthy males is normally only active in the testes , but in FSHD patients it is also active in other parts of the body . Another way to control genes is by nonsense-mediated decay , where incorrect or incomplete RNA molecules are destroyed before they can be used to make defective proteins . In this study , Feng et al . show that when DUX4 is activated following the failure of epigenetic control in FSHD patients , the effectiveness of nonsense-mediated decay is also reduced . This results in the build-up of incorrect RNA molecules inside muscle cells , which can harm the cell . In fact , 13% of the incorrect RNA molecules that are normally destroyed in cells were found at higher levels when DUX4 was active . To investigate how DUX4 could work , Feng et al . focused on another gene called UPF1 because cells without the protein encoded by this gene have similar defects in nonsense-mediated decay as cells with active DUX4 . No difference was found in how often the UPF1 gene is activated in FSHD cells and normal cells . However , the amount of the protein encoded by UPF1 was lower in cells with FSHD than in normal muscle cells . The experiments show that the protein encoded by UPF1 is broken down as a result of the activation of the DUX4 gene , leading to problems with nonsense-mediated decay , which may result in the worsening of FSHD symptoms . The twist in the tale is that DUX4 itself is also controlled by nonsense-mediated decay under normal circumstances . Therefore , in diseased cells , a failure in epigenetic control allows DUX4 to prevent its own destruction by tampering with nonsense-mediated decay . These findings offer new insights into the role of the DUX4 gene in FSHD . The next step is to test whether these defects in nonsense-mediated decay can explain any of the symptoms of FSHD , such as muscle inflammation .", "source": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy ( FSHD ) is a muscular dystrophy caused by inefficient epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array and somatic expression of the DUX4 retrogene . DUX4 is a double homeobox transcription factor that is normally expressed in the testis and causes apoptosis and FSHD when misexpressed in skeletal muscle . The mechanism ( s ) of DUX4 toxicity in muscle is incompletely understood . We report that DUX4-triggered proteolytic degradation of UPF1 , a central component of the nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) machinery , is associated with profound NMD inhibition , resulting in global accumulation of RNAs normally degraded as NMD substrates . DUX4 mRNA is itself degraded by NMD , such that inhibition of NMD by DUX4 protein stabilizes DUX4 mRNA through a double-negative feedback loop in FSHD muscle cells . This feedback loop illustrates an unexpected mode of autoregulatory behavior of a transcription factor , is consistent with \u2018bursts\u2019 of DUX4 expression in FSHD muscle , and has implications for FSHD pathogenesis . \n Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy ( FSHD ) is typically an adult-onset muscular dystrophy characterized by muscle weakness initially affecting the face ( facio ) , shoulders ( scapulo ) , and upper arms ( humeral ) . FSHD is caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q , due to either D4Z4 repeat contractions ( Lemmers et al . , 2010 ) or mutations affecting trans-acting epigenetic regulators of the D4Z4 repeat such as SMCHD1 ( Lemmers et al . , 2012 ) , which results in the misexpression of DUX4 mRNA in skeletal muscle and possibly other somatic tissues . DUX4 encodes a double homeobox transcription factor that activates germline genes and repetitive elements ( Geng et al . , 2012 ) and causes apoptosis and atrophic myotube formation when misexpressed in skeletal muscle ( Kowaljow et al . , 2007; Vanderplanck et al . , 2011; Wallace et al . , 2011; Mitsuhashi et al . , 2012 ) . DUX4 is expressed in only a small fraction of nuclei ( Snider et al . , 2010 ) , likely due to occasional \u2018bursts\u2019 of DUX4 expression . However , the mechanism ( s ) regulating DUX4 expression and toxicity remain incompletely understood . We previously ectopically expressed DUX4 in immortalized ( 54-1 ) and primary ( MB135 ) myoblasts and used RNA-seq to identify coding genes , repetitive elements , and non-coding RNAs induced by DUX4 ( Young et al . , 2013 ) . Further analysis of this data showed that DUX4 expression also resulted in the increased abundance of many coding RNA isoforms containing premature translation termination codons upstream of splice junctions . These isoforms , which are predicted substrates for degradation by nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) , were present at very low levels in control myoblasts . Following DUX4 expression , however , many such predicted NMD substrates increased in abundance and in many cases became the predominant mRNA product of the parent gene . For example , an isoform of the SRSF3 gene containing a well-characterized NMD-inducing cassette exon ( Lareau et al . , 2007; Ni et al . , 2007 ) was present at low levels prior to DUX4 expression but became the dominant isoform thereafter in both 54-1 and MB135 cells ( Figure 1A\u2013B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04996 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04996 . 004 To determine whether increased levels of such normally degraded mRNAs were associated with reduced NMD efficiency , we used an exogenous reporter system . We transfected plasmids encoding either the wild-type \u03b2-globin open reading frame or \u03b2-globin with a premature termination codon that induces degradation by NMD ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . Relative levels of the \u03b2-globin NMD substrate were twofold higher in DUX4-expressing vs control myoblasts , indicating that NMD is indeed compromised by DUX4 ( Figure 1C ) . We then determined how reduced NMD efficiency affected global levels of predicted NMD substrates . Restricting to cassette exon splicing events where one isoform , but not both , was a predicted NMD substrate , we found that \u223c13% of such predicted NMD substrates increased following DUX4 expression , while \u223c1 . 6% decreased , in 54-1 cells ( Figure 1D ) . Impaired NMD also caused accumulation of aberrant mRNAs resulting from mis-splicing or incomplete splicing , which are common byproducts of the stochastic nature of the splicing process ( Weischenfeldt et al . , 2012 ) . We identified and quantified alternative splicing of annotated constitutive junctions , finding that \u223c13% of such junctions exhibited increased aberrant splicing in DUX4-expressing vs control cells , while only \u223c0 . 25% exhibited decreased aberrant splicing ( Figure 1E ) . The vast majority of these novel products of annotated constitutive junctions were present at very low or undetectable levels in control 54-1 myoblasts . We next extended this analysis to all classes of splicing events , including mis-splicing and intron retention of constitutive splice junctions . DUX4 expression caused increased levels of predicted NMD substrates for all classes of splicing events in both 54-1 and MB135 cells ( Figure 1F ) . These increases were generally more extreme in 54-1 than in MB135 cells , likely due to the \u223c15-fold higher DUX4 expression achieved in 54-1 vs MB135 cells as well as the longer time period allowed for infection ( 48 hr vs 24 hr ) . High levels of NMD substrates in DUX4-expressing cells were not simply a side effect of DUX4-induced apoptosis . TP53 knock-down ( KD ) prevented apoptosis following DUX4 expression in normal myoblasts , confirming previous reports that DUX4 toxicity is p53-dependent ( Wallace et al . , 2011 ) . However , TP53 KD did not prevent DUX4-induced NMD inhibition ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . DUX4 could potentially inhibit NMD by transcriptionally repressing components of the NMD machinery . However , no UPF or SMG NMD factors exhibited decreased mRNA levels following DUX4 expression , and most were up-regulated by two- to fourfold ( Figure 2A ) . This expression pattern was reminiscent of a recent report that mRNA levels of most NMD factors increase following the knock-down of UPF1 , encoding a central component of the NMD machinery ( Huang et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that UPF1 mRNA and protein levels might be decoupled in DUX4-expressing cells . We measured levels of UPF1 , which was not transcriptionally up-regulated in DUX4-expressing cells , and UPF3B and SMG7 , which were transcriptionally up-regulated in response to DUX4 . UPF1 protein levels were markedly lower in DUX4-expressing myoblasts than in control myoblasts , as were SMG7 levels , although to a lesser extent . In contrast , UPF3B levels were unaffected by DUX4 expression ( Figure 2B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04996 . 005Figure 2 . DUX4 destabilizes UPF1 via the proteasome .

Error bars , standard deviation . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04996 . 005 To determine whether decreased UPF1 temporally correlates with DUX4-induced inefficient NMD , we conducted a time course following DUX4 expression in myoblasts . DUX4 was robustly detectable 12\u201314 hr after lentiviral infection , coincident with the beginning of a sharp decrease in UPF1 levels ( Figure 2C\u2013D ) . SMG7 showed a more modest decrease through the time course , while UPF3B levels were relatively constant . NMD substrates produced from the \u03b2-globin reporter , as well as endogenously produced from the SRSF2 and SRSF3 genes , exhibited increased levels 12\u201314 hr after lentiviral expression ( Figure 2E\u2013F ) . The close temporal coupling between DUX4 protein production , decreased UPF1 levels , and increased levels of both endogenous and exogenous NMD substrates suggests that insufficient levels of UPF1\u2014and perhaps additional NMD machinery components such as SMG7\u2014may contribute to inefficient NMD in DUX4-expressing cells . The rapid decrease in UPF1 levels that we observed suggested that DUX4 might trigger UPF1 degradation . To test this , we treated DUX4-expressing or control myoblasts with MG132 to inhibit the proteasome . MG132 treatment restored normal UPF1 levels in DUX4-expressing myoblasts , while UPF1 levels in control myoblasts were unaffected ( Figure 2G\u2013H ) . As proteasome inhibition inhibits normal translation ( Cowan and Morley , 2004; Mazroui et al . , 2007 ) and therefore NMD , we were unable to test whether the restoration of normal UPF1 levels by proteasomal inhibition rescued NMD . However , the close temporal relationship between the onset of decreased UPF1 levels and increased NMD substrates strongly suggests that UPF1 degradation contributes to NMD inhibition in DUX4-expressing cells . Both DUX4 isoforms encoding the full-length protein contain a constitutively spliced intron within their 3\u2032 UTRs , rendering them likely NMD substrates ( Figure 3A ) . To test this , we used cells isolated from FSHD1 ( 54-2 , which are isogenic to normal 54-1 cells but carry a contracted D4Z4 array ) and FSHD2 ( MB200 ) skeletal muscle ( Krom et al . , 2012; Schoenberg and Maquat , 2012; Young et al . , 2013 ) . We knocked down UFP1 in 54-2 and MB200 myoblasts to 24 . 3% and 32 . 4% of normal protein levels , respectively , and differentiated these myoblasts to myotubes to stimulate DUX4 transcription . DUX4 mRNA was expressed at approximately fourfold higher levels in UPF1 KD vs control KD myotubes , as was ZSCAN4 mRNA , which is transcriptionally activated by DUX4 ( Figure 3B\u2013D ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04996 . 006Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04996 . 006 We next sought to determine whether the intron-containing 3\u2032 UTR of DUX4 contributed to the degradation of DUX4 mRNA by NMD . We created chimeric constructs containing the \u03b2-globin open reading frame followed by either the complete DUX4 3\u2032 UTR or the DUX4 3\u2032 UTR with the second intron removed ( Figure 3E ) . We focused on the constitutively spliced second intron within the 3\u2032 UTR because it lies 100 nt downstream of the termination codon , and therefore it is predicted to trigger NMD . Transcripts from the chimeric construct containing the complete DUX4 3\u2032 UTR increased twofold following UPF1 KD in normal myoblasts\u2014a substantial but smaller increase than we observed for the endogenous DUX4 mRNA , perhaps due to the chimeric nature of the \u03b2-globin + DUX4 3\u2032 UTR construct\u2014while transcripts from the construct lacking the second intron of the DUX4 3\u2032 UTR increased only 1 . 5-fold . We conclude that the second intron of the DUX4 3\u2032 UTR is important for NMD-induced degradation of the DUX4 mRNA ( Figure 3F ) . DUX4 exhibits variegated expression in FSHD muscle cells , with only a few percent of nuclei detectable as DUX4+ ( Snider et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , augmented DUX4 expression following UPF1 KD in myotubes could be due to increases in DUX4 mRNA in nuclei that are already DUX4+ and/or increases in the fraction of DUX4+ nuclei . Immunostaining of FSHD myotubes revealed that the fraction of DUX4+ nuclei increased from 0 . 3% to 2 . 1% following UPF1 KD , a substantial order-of-magnitude increase ( Figure 3G ) . Together , our data show that NMD is an endogenous suppressor of DUX4 mRNA levels that contributes to the very low and variegated expression of DUX4 , a characteristic feature of FSHD muscle cells . As DUX4 expression inhibits NMD and NMD degrades DUX4 mRNA , we hypothesized that DUX4 and the NMD pathway might participate in a double-negative feedback loop ( Figure 4A ) . This feedback loop predicts that DUX4 will indirectly stabilize its own mRNA by inhibiting NMD . To test this , we ectopically expressed DUX4 in FSHD1 and FSHD2 myotubes and measured levels of endogenously transcribed DUX4 mRNA . Ectopic DUX4 expression led to an approximately fivefold increase in endogenously transcribed DUX4 mRNA levels ( Figure 4B ) . We next tested whether DUX4's spliced 3\u2032 UTR , which is important for NMD-mediated degradation of DUX4 mRNA , contributed to this increase . We transfected our chimeric \u03b2-globin + DUX4 3\u2032 UTR reporters into normal myoblasts and ectopically expressed DUX4 . Levels of the NMD-susceptible construct containing the complete DUX4 3\u2032 UTR increased 1 . 43-fold following ectopic DUX4 expression , while levels of the construct without the second intron of the DUX4 3\u2032 UTR exhibited a more modest increase of 1 . 08-fold ( Figure 4C ) . As with the UPF1 KD experiments , the chimeric construct exhibited more modest effect sizes in these feedback loop experiments than we observed for the endogenous DUX4 mRNA itself . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04996 . 007Figure 4 .

( D ) Schematic of potential model of interactions between DUX4 and NMD in healthy ( top ) and FSHD ( bottom ) muscle cells . In healthy cells , DUX4 mRNA is efficiently degraded by NMD; in FSHD cells , DUX4 triggers proteolytic degradation of UPF1 and inhibits NMD , resulting in the accumulation of DUX4 mRNA and protein . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04996 . 007 Together , our data demonstrate that the DUX4 3\u2032 UTR targets DUX4 mRNA for NMD and that DUX4-mediated inhibition of NMD results in increased perdurance of the DUX4 mRNA as a possible mechanism of positive autoregulation ( Figure 4D ) . It is unclear whether NMD-mediated autoregulation is intrinsic to normal DUX4 function or instead an abnormal consequence of inappropriate DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle . However , it is interesting to consider that this mechanism might contribute to the spreading of DUX4 expression between adjacent nuclei in a muscle fiber . Because muscle fibers contain arrays of closely spaced nuclei , the expression of DUX4 mRNA from one nucleus will distribute protein to the surrounding nuclei and induce a region of NMD inhibition . If one of the surrounding nuclei subsequently expresses DUX4 , then that mRNA would be unusually stable due to locally inefficient NMD , thereby facilitating the spread of DUX4 mRNA and protein throughout the fiber . The close temporal coupling between the onset of DUX4 expression , decreases in UPF1 protein , and increases in NMD substrates ( Figure 2 ) strongly suggests that DUX4-mediated degradation of UPF1 contributes to DUX4-induced NMD inhibition . In the absence of a direct mechanistic link between UPF1 degradation and NMD inhibition , we were unable to determine whether insufficient UPF1 protein levels are primarily responsible for DUX4-induced NMD inhibition or instead merely one of the several contributing factors . Nonetheless , as we are unaware of other reports of physiological stimuli triggering rapid UPF1 protein degradation , our data suggest that UPF1 proteolysis constitutes a potential new regulator of cellular NMD efficiency . DUX4 may prove a useful system to gain insight into the biological relevance of this mechanism for altering NMD efficiency . We previously observed that many of the most up-regulated genes following DUX4 expression in normal myoblasts are involved in the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system , including numerous E3 ubiquitin ligases ( Geng et al . , 2012 ) . It is therefore tempting to speculate that DUX4-induced dysregulation of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system is responsible for triggering UPF1 protein degradation . However , the precise mechanism by which DUX4 induces UPF1 proteolysis , and whether that mechanism is specific to the FSHD disease state , remains to be elucidated . DUX4-mediated inhibition of NMD may contribute to FSHD pathophysiology through both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms . The accumulation of abnormal RNAs may cause direct or indirect toxic effects in muscle cells due to intrinsic toxicity of abnormal RNAs or a stress response to the production of abnormal proteins . FSHD muscle is frequently characterized by a T-cell infiltrate ( Arahata et al . , 1995 ) , and it is possible that stabilized NMD substrates encode novel peptides with antigenic potential , contributing to an immune response ( Pastor et al . , 2010 ) . Production of antigenic peptides could potentially enable even a small fraction of DUX4+ nuclei to induce widespread pathology within a muscle fiber . Directly detecting or measuring DUX4-induced NMD inhibition in FSHD muscle biopsies or in bulk populations of cultured FSHD muscle cells is not feasible due to the low fraction of DUX4+ nuclei present at any given time in the absence of ectopic DUX4 expression . With DUX4+ nuclei constituting only 0 . 3% of the bulk population of cultured FSHD muscle cells ( Figure 3G ) , changes in the ratios of NMD and non-NMD isoforms in these DUX4+ nuclei are swamped by the normal levels expressed by the vast majority of DUX4\u2212 nuclei . Single-cell assays of NMD efficiency are likely required to demonstrate DUX4-induced NMD inhibition in unperturbed patient cells . However , future efforts to identify the downstream antigenic products or toxic effects of stabilized NMD substrates may prove fruitful even in a bulk cell population . Consistent with the idea that NMD inhibition may contribute to DUX4 toxicity in skeletal muscle , it is interesting to note that the degree of NMD inhibition induced by DUX4 is comparable to that observed in previous studies involving genetic ablation of components of the NMD machinery . For example , a recent study of mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Smg1 , which encodes a kinase responsible for phosphorylating UPF1 , found that 9% of predicted NMD substrates created by alternative splicing exhibited increased levels relative to wild-type cells ( McIlwain et al . , 2010 ) . In comparison , we found that 13% of such substrates were up-regulated following DUX4 expression ( Figure 1 ) , suggesting that DUX4-induced NMD inhibition causes profoundly abnormal RNA metabolism . As RNA toxicity is the major pathophysiologic mechanism in myotonic dystrophy , it is interesting to consider that RNA-mediated disease mechanisms may also have important roles in FSHD . \n FASTQ files for the DUX4 expression experiments were downloaded from the NCBI GEO database under accession number GSE45883 ( Young et al . , 2013 ) . The UCSC knownGene ( Meyer et al . , 2013 ) and Ensembl 71 ( Flicek et al . , 2013 ) genome annotations were merged to create a single genome annotation . Splicing event annotations from MISO v2 . 0 ( Katz et al . , 2010 ) were then added to this merged genome annotation . Constitutive splice junctions were defined as those for which neither the 5\u2032 nor 3\u2032 splice site was alternatively spliced in the UCSC knownGene annotation . Predicted NMD substrates were annotated by identifying isoforms containing premature termination codons >50 nt upstream of a splice junction . For the purposes of predicting NMD substrates , open reading frames were assigned based on UniProt annotations ( UniProt Consortium , 2012 ) when available , and Ensembl predicted reading frames when UniProt annotations were not available . For the purposes of RNA-seq read mapping , an additional annotation file consisting of all splice junctions annotated in the UCSC , Ensembl 71 , and MISO v2 . 0 annotations was created . This splice junction file was then with a list of all possible junctions between the annotated 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites of isoforms in the annotation ( to detect novel alternative splicing ) . Reads were mapped to the UCSC hg19 ( NCBI GRCh37 ) genome assembly . RSEM ( Li and Dewey , 2011 ) was modified to call Bowtie ( Langmead et al . , 2009 ) v1 . 0 . 0 with the -v 2 argument . RSEM was then called with the arguments --bowtie-m 100 --bowtie-chunkmbs 500 --calc-ci --output-genome-bam on the genome annotation . Read alignments with mapq scores of 0 and/or a splice junction overhang of less than 6 bp were then filtered out . Remaining unaligned reads were then aligned TopHat ( Trapnell et al . , 2009 ) v2 . 0 . 8b with the arguments --bowtie1 --read-mismatches 2 --read-edit-dist 2 --no-mixed --no-discordant --min-anchor-length 6 --splice-mismatches 0 --min-intron-length 10 --max-intron-length 1000000 --min-isoform-fraction 0 . 0 --no-novel-juncs --no-novel-indels --raw-juncs on the splice junction file ( --mate-inner-dist and --mate-std-dev were calculated by mapping to constitutive coding exons with MISO's exon_utils . py utility ) . Alignments produced by this call to TopHat were then filtered identically to the alignments produced by RSEM . Reads aligned by RSEM and TopHat were then merged to create BAM files of all aligned reads . Gene expression was quantified using RSEM as described above . Isoform ratios were quantified using two distinct methods . First , MISO was used to quantify isoform ratios for alternative splicing events contained in MISO's v2 . 0 annotations . Second , novel alternative splicing or intron retention of annotated constitutive splice junctions was quantified using reads crossing the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 splice sites as previously described ( Hubert et al . , 2013 ) . Differentially spliced events were defined as those with at >20 identifying reads ( identifying reads support one or more , but not all , isoforms of a splicing event ) , a change in isoform ratio \u226510% , and a Bayes factor \u22655 ( computed with Wagenmakers's framework [Wagenmakers et al . , 2010] ) . We used previously described lentiviral constructs expressing full-length DUX4 or GFP as a control ( Geng et al . , 2012 ) . Lentiviral particles were generated by the FHCRC Core Center of Excellence in Hematology Vector Production Core . Viral particle number was estimated with the WPRE element within the viral vector . Myoblasts were transduced at a MOI of \u223c15 in the presence of 8 \u00b5g/ml polybrene . At this MOI , >85% of myoblasts were DUX4+ or GFP+ . Unless otherwise noted , cells were collected for analysis 24 hr post-infection . Proliferating myoblasts were cultured in F-10-based growth media ( Gibco , Carlsbad , CA ) with 20% fetal bovine serum ( Gibco ) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin ( Gibco ) , supplemented with 10 ng/ml rhFGF ( Promega , Madison , WI ) and 1 \u00b5M dexamethasone ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . Growth media was changed every other day , and proliferating myoblasts were cultured at \u226450% confluence . To initiate myogenic differentiation , myoblasts were switched to an F-10-based differentiation media containing 1% horse serum ( Gibco ) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin , supplemented with 10 \u00b5g/ml insulin ( Sigma ) and 10 \u00b5g/ml transferrin ( Sigma ) at 99% confluence . The \u03b2-globin NMD ( \u2212 ) and NMD ( + ) plasmids were previously published as pmCMV-Gl Norm and pmCMV-Gl 39Ter ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . Plasmid reporters were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) , unless otherwise noted . To control for transfection efficiency , a control plasmid phCMV-MUP was co-transfected with the reporter as previously described ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . 2 \u00b5g of reporter along with 500 ng of control plasmid was used for transfecting cells in a six-well format . To measure DUX4-induced changes in NMD efficiency , cells were infected with lentiviral DUX4 or GFP 24 hr after transfection of the NMD reporters . For the DUX4 time course experiments , the NMD ( \u2212 ) and NMD ( + ) reporters were transfected along with phCMV-MUP using the SuperFect reagent ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) , and the lentiviral transduction was performed 12 hr post-transfection . siRNAs against UPF1 ( Thermo Scientific , Waltham , MA , On-Target siRNA #J-011763-07 ) and TP53 ( Ambion , Silencer Select siRNA #4390824 ) , as well as the control siRNA ( Thermo Scientific ) , were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Life Technologies ) . Cells were lysed with TRIzol ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and the RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions . RNA was subsequently cleaned up with Qiagen RNeasy columns , with on-column DNase digestion . 1 \u00b5g of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with Life Technologies SuperScriptIII First-Strand System . 2% of this cDNA was used as a template for real-time qPCR with Life Technologies Power SYBR Green Master Mix . qPCR primer sequences are provided in Supplementary file 1 . Note that levels of endogenous DUX4 mRNA following ectopic DUX4 expression were measured with primers specific to the DUX4 mRNA's 3\u2032 UTR ( the DUX4 lentiviral construct contained the coding sequence alone ) . To determine how UPF1 KD affected DUX4 expression , proliferating 54-2 or MB200 myoblasts were transfected with siUPF1 or siControl and switched to differentiation media 48 hr post-transfection . Protein extracts from the UPF1 KD experiments were generated by lysing cell pellets in protease inhibitor cOmplete ULTRA ( Roche , Switzerland ) containing RIPA buffer ( Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA ) along with sonication . For the DUX4 time course and MG132 treatment , protein was extracted in parallel with the RNA from cells lysed in the TRIzol reagent . Protein pellets were resuspended in a sample buffer containing 5% SDS and 0 . 5 M unbuffered Tris base to ensure efficient solubilization . Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford or BCA protein assay . 5 \u00b5g of total protein was used for Western blotting . Antibodies used in this study are: anti-UPF1 ( Bethyl Laboratories , Montgomery , TX ) , anti-\u03b1-tubulin ( Sigma ) , anti-H3 ( Abcam , England ) , anti-UPF3B ( Bethyl Laboratories ) , anti-SMG7 ( Santa Cruz , Dallas , TX ) . HRP-conjugated ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) secondary antibodies were used for protein detection in all experiments except for the time course and proteasome inhibitor studies ( Figure 2 ) . For the experiments reported in Figure 2 , immunoblotting was performed using the LICOR system with the Odyssey blocking buffer and IRDye-conjugated secondary antibodies ( LICOR , Lincoln , NE ) . Quantification was performed using ImageQuant software ( GE Healthcare , Cleveland , OH ) using the nonspecific band as a normalizer to account for differences in protein loading . Histone 3 served as an additional loading control , though its very high signal intensity made it an inappropriate normalizer for quantitative analyses . 54-1 cells transduced with DUX4 or GFP lentivirus were treated 16 hr post-infection with 10 \u00b5M proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( Sigma ) . Samples were collected 8 hr after MG132 treatment , and UPF1 levels were estimated by immunoblotting . Histone H3 , which has a long half-life ( Toyama et al . , 2013 ) , was used as a loading control , in addition to the nonspecific band . Cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0 . 5% Triton X-100 , rinsed in PBS , and blocked in 1% BSA . Primary antibody against DUX4 ( Abcam , ab124699 ) was diluted in blocking buffer at 1:500 , and secondary anti-Rabbit TRITC ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , 711-025-152 ) was diluted in blocking buffer at 1:400 . For assaying apoptosis in DUX4-cells , Image-iT LIVE Red Poly Caspases Detection Kit ( Life Technologies , I35101 ) was used . For both experiments , fluorescently labeled cells were then viewed under the ZEISS Axiophot fluorescence microscope . For each sample , pictures from eight random fields were taken . ImageJ ( Fiji ) was used for image analysis and quantification . The genomic locus of the DUX4 3\u2032 UTR ( containing both introns ) was amplified from a genomic fragment harboring 2 . 5 D4Z4 repeats ( Gabri\u00ebls et al . , 1999 ) ( L42 clone; GenBank ID FJ439133 . 1 ) . The DUX4 3\u2032 UTR lacking the second intron was amplified from cDNA isolated from differentiated 54-2 cells ( the first intron is frequently retained in DUX4 cDNA ) . The \u03b2-globin NMD ( \u2212 ) reporter backbone was linearized by forward and reverse PCR primers sitting downstream and upstream of the \u03b2-globin 3\u2032 UTR ( primers listed in Supplementary file 1 ) . Amplicons of the DUX4 3\u2032 UTR containing or lacking the second intron were flanked with sequences overlapping the linearized \u03b2-globin NMD ( \u2212 ) backbone lacking the \u03b2-globin 3\u2032 UTR . The NEB Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit was used to insert the DUX4 3\u2032 UTR fragments into the linearized \u03b2-globin NMD ( \u2212 ) backbone ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) ."}
